","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista is a town full of young college-aged students who spend a lot of time in the sun and look pretty damn good. It makes sense that there’s a lot of sex happening. What also happens quite a bit is getting interrupted during the act. It’s happened to almost everybody I know, and in many different compromising … positions. Most recently I was interrupted during the fulfillment of a certain job, which is taxing enough given the need to control one’s gag reflex and also give pleasure at the same time. I heard a door open and paused — dick in mouth. I looked up to make direct eye contact with a housemate who had gone into the adjoining room for who knows what.</p>\n<p>In another circumstance we could’ve laughed it off, but in this case, it felt as though she was more offended than I or the guy I was with was. This brings me to the question: in a place where most people are having sex, and we’re stacked on top of each other sometimes three to a room, why do some people get upset when they hear or see people having sex? Why is it surprising and why can’t people just knock?</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

But outside of our nuclear friend groups there are social stigmas that attach themselves to our sexual actions which reach back to how we are taught about sex, and the social climate of the United States as a whole. The walk of shame, for example, is seemingly only something that exists for women. Walking through the hallways of a frat in which you may have hooked up with someone, you’re more likely to be greeted with catcalls than high fives, and the promenade home opens you up to a bevy of evil eye glances and calls of the word “slut.”</p>\n<p>Men have a completely different experience. Maybe it’s because their going-out clothes transition better from night to day, but either way, the difference is stark. We all do it, want to do it and if we haven’t we most likely will eventually, so the idea that people are shamed in a place where people wear ass-bearing shorts more often than coats or sweaters is inane and harmful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the best and perhaps most upsetting examples of being shamed for something entirely natural, a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her (she had also assumed the people in question were being loud purposely, knowing she was outside). My friend was rightly confused as to why it was assumed she was being blatantly exhibitionist without at least a clarification first; but more troublingly, why did the knowledge that sex was happening near her hurt her soul? I’d be happy for whoever was getting it, but that’s just me. At the very least, I’d suggest putting in a pair of headphones and continuing on with your life. The idea that someone could be judged in the middle of an intimate act is something, that if I had the time and money to complete a second degree at UCSB, I most definitely would devote a thesis to studying.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room…</p></blockquote>\n<p>All of this can culminate in a denial that seems to shock most of us when we see somebody getting it, giving it or what have you. It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room (mine is a single so it happens more rarely) or in a private place you wouldn’t expect someone to walk in unannounced. This can be jarring for all parties involved. For example, imagine my surprise when during one of the activities in question, I heard a loud knock on my bedroom door. I was home alone at the time except for the guy with me of course, so I was thoroughly confused.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This situation really arose from a lack of boundaries because it turned out that a friend of my housemate’s wanted to know if she was home and apparently wasn’t deterred by the sounds coming from my room. It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing. In a situation where your privacy has been violated, as is the case much of the time, I think it’s fair to have a little fun and make sure the party that’s really guilty gets at least as embarrassed as you did.</p>\n<p>I guess the last thing that must be discussed is what to do when you catch someone in the act. If I didn’t really know the person, I’d apologize and make a hasty exit. If it were a friend, I’d do the same, and then high five them and ask for details later. But I suppose the best advice I have is never judge because it will almost inevitably happen to you, just based on the number of times you’re likely to have sex during your lifetime. Not only this, but remember to always, <i>always</i> knock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sebastianne Kent can’t imagine a scenario where you shouldn’t knock, just to make sure.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/","id":6302,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6301,6300,6299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Cuddling Turns to Smothering","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cuddle-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cuddle-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos talks boundaries when it comes to that thing we do when the weather is bad.

If you’re just sleeping with someone, no strings attached, should you cuddle after sex? Doesn’t cuddling imply some sort of emotional attachment? While it would seem that the act of getting naked and having sex would be much more intimidating than simply spooning, this isn’t always the case.  Obviously, the best way to avoid this uncertainty is to ensure that you and your partner are both on the same page in regards to what you’re wanting out of your relationship. While unwanted snuggling can be awkward, it’s not nearly as bad as being scurried out after just giving yourself to someone intimately. Once your intentions have been established, it’s important to make sure that your cuddling doesn’t cross boundaries that can turn it into smothering.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own?</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I enjoy the occasional cuddling. It can feel comforting and reassuring, especially when a romantic connection is involved. However, when it comes to sleeping, I prefer to maintain my own space. My all-time favorite sleeping position is by far on my side. I feel like it gives me the opportunity to be the most flexible, as well as being the optimal positioning for temperature control (one leg out of the covers, one leg in, etc.). However, I’ve come to the realization that this position seems to appear as an invitation for spooning when laying in bed with someone else, especially post-sex. Originally, I figured the body language associated with this position was, “Ok, I’ve rolled over away from you now, don’t touch me.” Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong. Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own? Especially in Isla Vista, where air conditioning is basically non-existent, how does anyone deal with the sweltering conditions that come with having someone lay basically all of their body weight on top of you? It’s a phenomenon that I can’t seem to figure out, along with handholding. I think holding hands when cuddling is sweet and romantic, but when you’re trying to pass out, it’s not exactly ideal. It’s rather restricting and uncomfortable. Having your fingers intertwined with anyone else’s while unconscious doesn’t seem pleasant, nor safe, especially if you roll around a lot like me. I completely understand wanting to show affection after hooking up, and I firmly believe that it helps to create and sustain a bond, but at the same time, a restful slumber is not something to be compromised.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Cuddling can also take a wrong turn the morning after; when you’ve just woken up groggy, unprepared and unattractive. Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.  You have yet to freshen up your hair and face. You have yet to brush your teeth. And chances are, you probably really have to pee. It can be unbelievably unpleasant to be woken up with an embrace, especially when it’s unexpected. Mornings are meant to be peaceful, easy and slow, not awkward and stressful. Waking up to being grabbed and kissed is sometimes startling and quite honestly, annoying. I prefer to have a little bit of time to collect myself and come together before being overwhelmed with tenderness and care. After I’ve gargled some Listerine and fully come to, I think some morning-time endearment is great. But until then, I need some space to start my day off right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what your relationship status is, some people find post-sex cuddling to be a necessity, while others can do without it. I personally think finding a healthy balance is the best route to go. Boundaries are necessary in every aspect of a relationship, even when it comes to something as small as cuddling. Finding that comfortable middle can help ensure that you still feel desired and loved, without feeling suffocated. </span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos advocates for a healthy amount of cuddling, done at the right time. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69833\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69833\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/","id":6301,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6300,6299,6298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bernie’s Leftism is Not Americanism: A Response to UCSB For Bernie","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A letter to the editor from Howard Sachs responding to UCSB for Bernie's most recent article.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Bernie Sanders with people on and off campus.

I have nothing to do with P.U. but it is one of the best sites to present the other side- the side essentially banned from our universities, the side you are rejecting These are the values that gave Bernie everything, that makes his life dignified. These are the values he and you, right now, reject. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was young once too. Most young people are attracted to leftism. I campaigned and voted for George McGovern. Passionate and idealistic, many young people are arrtacted to leftism. They are attracted because leftism is very alluring. It is utopianism- almost a heavenly kind of thing. “All will be pretty much free. We will just take from the greedy rich and distribute it to others and then everyone will have great healthcare, and free college, and a nice warm place to live, a good safe car, no polluting fossil fuels, and plenty of healthy food, good clothing and shelter.”  I know the idea too, “corporations are what are pulling us all down. If only we crush those 20 million dollar a year CEO’s, all will be well again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I tell you, college is just the first tiny step into the world of knowledge, wisdom, experience and idealism. Most people when they leave college and get married, take care of a spouse and kid, start working, start experiencing and understanding the world around them change markedly.  I think they become better people. I think they grow up and become actually more idealistic and more compassionate but with mature ideals and compassion.  They come to understand true morality, maturity and love with American values- not leftist ones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American values tell us lots and lots of liberty is at the core of our lives.

Leftism is the opposite. Bernie and his like are about seas of coercion and power populated with small islands of freedom and liberty. Bernie and his massive government’s, after reaching into your pockets and taking most of your property will then will tell you and I what schools to go to, what kind of healthcare to receive, what cars to drive, how to educate our kids, what type of energy to use, how to save for retirement, how much income is enough and what kind of light bulbs we can screw into our desk lamps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But leftism and Bernie are alluring to us all. The child never leaves the core part of our souls. We all yearn to be taken care of from the day we are born to the day we die. But Americanism, American values help us grow up. They help us leave Eden and face the real beautiful and yes challenging adult world out there. Bernie has never really left that world of childhood. He is a kind, decent, well meaning man but stuck in childish fantasies. Good luck to you. I hope you leave college continuing to learn and experience. I wish you well. I hope you someday embrace Americanism as strong, tough, self-reliant and very free people.  I hope you reject someday the mean, coercive, freedom and maturity -crushing ideology of leftism. Life is complex and a challenge for all of us, those on the left and those of us who embrace American values.  Onward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69187\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69187\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/","id":5764,"author":{"id":400,"name":"Howard Sachs"},"related":[5763,5762,5761],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"C.A.P.S.’s C+ Grade Needs Improvement, Investment","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Members of the office of the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs at UCSB offer a response to C.A.P.S.'s recent C+ grade given by the University of California Student Association.

Across the UC system and here at UCSB, the university’s insufficient support for student mental health services makes this far from a reality. According to the American College Health Association, 30 percent of college students report being too depressed to function. One in five college students will be diagnosed with depression during their undergraduate career. For the past three years, the number of new students seen by UCSB’s Counseling And Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has increased by an average of 26 percent. While C.A.P.S. has expanded and continues to support an increasing number of students, the amount of funding provided to our mental health services at UCSB does not meet the needs of our student body. This disconnect between C.A.P.S.’s needs and its capacity has been damaging.<br>\nStudents have expressed dissatisfaction in the wait times for appointments. Clinicians are not provided adequate space and room accommodations. In a setting where we want to promote racial and gender equity, our counseling staff does not adequately reflect the diversity of our student body. Furthermore, the culture of our campus is not yet one that entirely fosters mental health.<br>\n“#HowAreYou: A Call to Reform Student Mental Health Services” is a UC Student Association (UCSA) campaign working to improve the accessibility, diversity and outreach in mental health services at each UC. UCSA has created an expansive rubric in order to grade mental health services on each campus. The rubric measures certain aspects of our counseling services, such as wait times, the trend in intake appointments, the diversity of clinicians, Full Time Equivalent (FTE)-to-student ratio, etc. in order to diagnose areas in which C.A.P.S. can improve. As a result of this study, UCSA awarded UCSB’s C.A.P.S. a grade of C+.<br>\nThis grade is not to criticize C.A.P.S. or C.A.P.S. Staff, who have worked innovatively to improve services with the limited resources they have, but rather to bring to light the damage that comes when such vital student resources are allowed to be under resourced. We hope that this serves as a call to action, both for the community to be more aware of the services and its necessary changes and for UCSB administration to do more about improving this vital service on campus.<br>\nUCSB’s C.A.P.S. excels as they allow students to be seen the same day that they come and express they need help. Other campuses have same day appointments, but only for students exhibiting signs of crisis, and some have no kinds of same day appointments at all. These walk-in appointments are a unique innovation — started at UCSB — that maximize the potential of our clinical staff while also setting our campus up to be one that provides resources on a needs basis. However, this does not support students who require long-term care, because follow-up appointments must still be scheduled weeks in advance.<br>\nUCSB also leads in counseling services, compared to the other UCs, with our mental health peer program, in which students work with C.A.P.S. to provide resources to others in need. C.A.P.S. has excelled in preventing suicide with our #SaySomething campaign, and has made great strides in supporting our black students in response to a series of demands made by the Black Student Union in 2013.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68781\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68781\" data-attachment-id=\"68781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/ucsb-caps-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"594,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB CAPS 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2-250x161.png?resize=583%2C376\" alt=\"Image courtesy of UCSA\" width=\"583\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of UCSA</p></div>\n<p>These are the things that we must do to ensure that students will receive adequate mental health services:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p><strong>1. The hiring of more diverse and culturally competent clinicians:</strong></p>\n<p>National trends indicate that people of color use mental health services at a lower rate than their white counterparts. African Americans and Chican@/Latin@ Americans used mental health services at about one half the rate of Caucasian Americans in the past year. In the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) community, that rate shrank to one third. Studies have shown that matching the race and sex of the therapist to that of the client increases the acceptability and effectiveness of treatment services. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UCSB should not be this drastically lacking Hispanic serving clinicians. Thus, the hiring of API, Chican@/Latin@, South Asian, Middle Eastern and North African serving clinicians is a must.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The expansion and improvement of the C.A.P.S. building:</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility and comfort are necessary for fostering an environment that supports mental health. Our current facility is struggling for space. With a new state of the art facility at UCSB, students will be able to receive care with more comfort and convenience. Climate controlled, spacious and confidential spaces have proven to help students in therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The integration of mental health services in academic and student life:</strong></p>\n<p>Placing a therapist in the residence halls provides more benefits than just the ease in accessibility. When therapists are in the residence halls, it contributes to an environment in which the residents understand that support is around them and accessible to them when they need it. For this reason, therapists should be placed wherever there is a high density of students, including residence halls, university apartments and areas on campus where stigma around mental health can be greater, like the S.T.E.M. buildings.<br>\nThe university should be a place where students thrive, not just endure. The changes we are calling for will allow us to address long wait times and short staffing and can create an environment on campus where we can truly care for all of us, especially those populations that are most vulnerable. This past summer, a group of UC students who were tired of week-long waiting times for their friends, frustrated with C.A.P.S. centers that didn’t have therapists that came from their communities and who believed deeply in the need to create a culture of compassion launched the #HowAreYou campaign. As students, we made improving our mental health services our priority; it’s time our administration did the same.</p>\n<p>Signed,<br>\nSiavash Zohoori, Mental Health Coordinator<br>\nLillian Cain, Policy Analyst<br>\nMohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs<br>\nAnumita Kaur, Campus Organizing Director</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/","id":5762,"author":{"id":402,"name":"Siavash Zohoori"},"related":[5761,5760,5759],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex Over Spring Break… The Safe Way","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos encourages you to think before you hop into bed over spring break.

This is every college student’s dream. This is Spring Break. It is the one week out of the year when losing your dignity and class is socially acceptable, and somewhat expected. Whether you stay in I.V. (where it’s basically Spring Break every week) or make your way to Mexico or Panama City Beach for some traditional Spring Break festivities, you’re guaranteed some crazy stories and fun memories. However, with great fun comes great responsibility. When combining heavy drinking and large quantities of attractive, but belligerent college students, it’s important to be alert and aware so that your Spring Break experience doesn’t turn sour. Wouldn’t you rather come home with a nice tan rather than a not-so-nice rash?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hooking up on Spring Break can be exciting and sexy for many reasons. The most obvious being that you will most likely never see the person ever again. The aroma of boxed wine, cigarette smoke and lack of commitment has a certain appeal to it. While these spontaneous affairs can be exhilarating and fun, it’s important to keep your wits about you. I learned this the hard way. Last year during Spring Break, I went on a trip to Panama City Beach, Florida (aka Spring Break capital of the world) with a group of my friends from Texas. I knew it would be an insane trip, and I couldn’t wait. The first couple of days were a blast. I was the perfect amount of drunk to enjoy the utter chaos that is PCB, yet still coherent and functioning. On our third day there, I drank way too much at the beach. I don’t remember how or when I got back to my hotel, but I woke up on a lawn chair on our hotel balcony. After waking up completely disoriented, and still hammered, my friends and I continued to drink in order to get ready for the bars. Pretty much everything that happens after that is extremely blurry. I apparently decided to take a shower after already having my hair and makeup done, and when I got out of the shower, there was a group of German students in my hotel room. I know, completely random. Turns out these guys were our hotel neighbors, and my friends had invited them over to pregame with us. In my intoxicated state, I struck up somewhat of a conversation with one of the guys that I thought was attractive (I say somewhat because he didn’t really speak English, and I could barely form sentences). After a very short amount of time, I ended up bed with him, and I have very little recollection of what happened. The only thing I remember is making him put on a new condom every three minutes because I was so scared that we weren’t using one. If I couldn’t even be aware enough of the fact that we were using protection, there is absolutely no reason why I should have been having sex. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After sobering up and realizing what I had done, I felt horrible. I had never had a sexual experience like that, and I was completely disappointed in my actions and judgment. I knew it was completely irresponsible and dangerous to get that drunk, but I did it anyway. Had I been more aware of my actions, I never would have slept with someone who was basically a stranger while completely belligerent. I knew I had no one to blame except myself. Even though I was much too drunk to be making the choice to have sex, he was as well, and we both willingly engaged in the act. It was a poor decision fueled by a lack of rational thought. After finding out that we did for sure use protection, I felt much better about the situation, but still disappointed. I began to realize that something much worse could have happened. Every year, horrible assault and rape stories emerge on the news from Spring Break. Just this past year, at the same location that I was at, a girl was raped by a group of guys on a public beach in front of a ton of students. The horrible crime was even filmed by cowardly, idiotic kids. The girl was completely unconscious as she was assaulted and violated. While the rape was 100 percent the fault of the rapists, the fact that other students didn’t intervene in the situation due to their partying and alcohol consumption is absolutely asinine. As sad as it is, our society has perpetuated this idea that rape is “normal” or “acceptable.” Rather than helping, people aimlessly watched and ignored a cruel act committed against a clearly vulnerable person in need. It is truly sad that we live in a society that promotes teaching women “how to not be raped or assaulted,” rather than teaching others to simply “not rape or assault.” However, until that changes, it is important to not make yourself even more vulnerable to those unthinkable acts, whether you’re male or female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being uncontrollably intoxicated is neither safe nor fun for many reasons. For one, you may make a regrettable and scary decision such as I did, or, you may lose valuable intuition and defenses that can help protect you when facing a threatening situation. Secondly, sex is so much better when you feel comfortable, secure and certain. Trust me. Spring Break is supposed to be one of the best weeks of the year, so know your limits, party hard and make the most of it. Oh, and as tempting as beaded necklaces can be, don’t flash your boobs for Snapchat. Those pictures will haunt you. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/","id":6299,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6298,6297,6296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why I (actually) Feel the Bern","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Felicia Balli talks about why she truly feel the Bern. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “Millennial.” I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “young woman in my 20s following a popular trend.” Put simply, I am voting for Bernie Sanders because I am educated. Now, I am not quite caught up on nuclear physics, and I would probably struggle a bit on any given biology exam (props to you, science majors … y’all the real MVPs), but I am also not the type to undervalue my political science degree and minor in women, development and culture as an “easy ride through the social sciences on my path to an MRS degree” (I can ramble on about that bullsh** stereotype for days, but I’m excited you’re still even reading this, so I will abstain from my desire to digress). </p>\n<blockquote><p>We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven’t always been interested in politics. In fact, I got into UCSB as an econ major and was weeded out by the econ majors that were indeed supposed to be there (as well as the ones that wisely chose not to thoroughly damage their livers the first quarter of freshman year). It wasn’t until my third year that a sociology course — later to become the foundation for my minor — allowed me to look at the bigger picture. I studied women, poverty and exploitation in the third world and was forced to take a hard look at the institutions that perpetuate injustices in these areas. We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass. As it turns out, however, the sources of this evil lie far closer to our realm of familiarity and influence than we realize, protected by a powerful system that we have underestimated and hidden behind a sensationalist media that has underestimated us. I was able to gain a global perspective that considered the genuine suffering of human lives — lives we often denigrate to nothing more than a statistic — and recognized the role politics had played in causing this suffering. The same politics that we get bored of and ignored. The politics that have — due to our lack of attention — fallen into the wrong hands and subsequently the wrong pockets. The United States has historically been the most powerful country in the world, so when we allow multi-billion dollar corporations to buy politicians and thus the votes that deregulate their activity, the repercussions of that are felt all over the world. </p>\n<blockquote><p> Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bernie Sanders is not making history because he is a viral trend amongst young idealists; his popularity has spiked because he has given people faith that we can create a politics that cares about people. He has created a movement that has brought people together from both the left and the right who can all agree that our political system is rigged. Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen. He has shown through record-breaking turnouts and individual contributions that the American people can regain control of our political process. We can no longer accept the narrative that politics are only for politicians. We can no longer fulfill the stereotype that young, educated Americans are more passionate about who wins “The Bachelor” than which American corporations profit from labor exploitation and human rights abuses around the world.  It is not just our duty to our country, but our responsibility to the global community to be politically active citizens who acknowledge that we indeed have the power to change the world.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/","id":5763,"author":{"id":397,"name":"Felicia Balli"},"related":[5762,5761,5760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"BDSM: Keep It Mutual","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","description":"I heard my friend’s story and was absolutely appalled.

It almost brought tears to my eyes, and it wasn’t just because she’d been hurt and humiliated, but overwhelmingly because she didn’t think there was anything wrong with it.</p>\n<p>When <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> swept our previously entirely vanilla cultural sex-scape, we were collectively dumbfounded by the open and unabashed display of a type of sexual activity that had been decidedly fringe. All of the sudden, there were BDSM-themed workout classes, outfits, makeup palettes and of course sex toys. The world of BDSM had been blown wide open for everyone to see (and enjoy) and I never really thought of it as an issue. In fact, it has been a point of intrigue I didn’t mind exploring, but for myself, and as I’d find later, for others, it took a dark turn.</p>\n<p>Romance novels such as <em>Twilight</em> and <em>Fifty Shades of Grey </em>drew scrutiny not because of the characters’ sex-capades (which in <em>Fifty Shades of Grey </em>were outlined and specified in a contract) but because of the controlling nature of the relationship itself. They were scrutinized for the man in the relationship following or tracking his <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">prey</span> girlfriend to make sure she’s safe, as if she’s not capable of doing that herself. What’s troubling about the level of control present in those relationships isn’t that it exists but that so many women seem to find it romantic. Why would we idealize a relationship founded on inequality and control? Sex is one thing, but a BDSM relationship leaves you with emotional scars that are much harder to erase.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The mark of these books on the women who read them varies depending greatly on the individual. Many of us can take these things with a grain of salt and read them as the entertaining sizzlers that they are. But hearing the horror stories experienced by the more impressionable or less empowered (neither of which I intend as a disparagement) turns the mind towards the lack of feminist education in our society. Some people like to be dominated, and some people like to be in control. However, in any relationship, understanding and mutual respect are key to lasting interaction.</p>\n<p>When my friend texted me mid rendezvous with her long time crush, I was really happy for her. As I heard more I became increasingly alarmed.</p>\n<p>“This is Christian Grey shit. He’s, like, beating me up, and I think I like it?” My worry was immediately incited.</p>\n<p>“He’s so hot I can’t dislike it, like slapping me in the face. Is that a thing?” I told her it could be she was enjoying it, but that I didn’t think that was what you’d expect the first time you hooked up with someone. More troubling was when I found out that type of sexual aggression was the reason they initially broke up.</p>\n<p>“Now I realize dominatrix is a thing … I’m gonna get drunk. Hopefully when he chokes me I’ll still be able to breathe. So far chances are slim.”</p>\n<p>Take a second with that. I know I needed to.</p>\n<p>I could input the whole conversation and feel like I was getting my point across. But this is about my friend as an exemplar of young women who feel like they need to put in huge amounts of effort to be accepted or feel desired, and seeing the rest of the conversation and how miserable she was might sadden you to the extent that it detracts from the larger picture. My point in this is that it isn’t fair. What made me even more upset hearing this is that there was no practiced, nuanced sexual experimentation. She didn’t orgasm because of a well-placed crop flick or a firm but practiced touch. There was no mutual enjoyment. He didn’t take a moment to think about her or her feelings, and saying no wasn’t enough for him to stop because there was no safe word and he just thought of it as part of the game. This was a young woman being taken advantage of because our society has fetishized controlling relationships and brought kink to the surface without offering enough context and making clear what is and isn’t okay.</p>\n<p>I told her, and have told friends on many occasions, my mantra, which is “she who holds the pussy holds the power.” It’s easy to say but not as easy to believe. It doesn’t mean you rule your relationships, but it means you get equal say in them and complete dominion over what happens to your body. If whips and chains do it for you, get trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey and have all the fun in the world. But playing powerless and being powerless are two different things; going into something with a stranger, or even someone you’re close to, while feeling helpless, powerless, terrified and alone is one thing, if that’s your goal (which is a whole different article), but is entirely another animal when you just wanted to have some fun. We live in a time of complete contradiction, and sometimes it feels like the sexual revolution only made things easier for men because women still get the brunt of the judgment.</p>\n<p>While there are thousands of intricate threads that comprise our collective attitude towards sex, self-respect is an ironclad principle. Do what you want if you like it, and if you don’t, for goodness sakes don’t. Stories, especially harlequin romances, shouldn’t be the basis for your real life relationships.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/bdsm-keep-it-mutual/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/bdsm-keep-it-mutual/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/bdsm-keep-it-mutual/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/bdsm-keep-it-mutual/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/bdsm-keep-it-mutual/","id":6300,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6299,6298,6297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No Hump, No Problem: Why I Stopped Having Sex at the Peak of My Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nohump.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nohump.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leilani Riahi takes a fresh approach to sex and rediscovers a love for people.

I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t stop having sex that night, even though this guy and I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t have sex. I liked him too much for that. I stopped having sex when I realized that I stopped having sex with people I liked because I liked them, and they may have liked me too, which meant that I was having sex with people that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t truly enjoy and who didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know me or care to either. DONE. Muthafuckin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GAME OVER for me to have casual sex when the casualness of it made me forget what pleasure sex brought to my lovely vagina in the first place. I think I got confused. I love sex. I love having sex. I started casual sex because it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s fun and it feels good. But I kept up casual sex because I wanted it to turn into a deep connection with someone, and casual sex is one of the only opportunities I saw to get to know a being (through as the side effect of spillover time, like whispering things before bed or sharing your class schedule with them the next day).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I don</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t remember this situation being that different, because at the end of it, he still asked for sex, and even though I said no, I couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think that all of the fluff was fluff to lead up to fucking, like foreplay to the foreplay. He left the next day and has barely contacted me since, and it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s quite all right. But I also couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think of how many times things felt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">different</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like that, and I did, in fact, like that person, and they may or may not have liked me, but either having sex even though I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to yet or not having sex because I LIKED THEM AND DID WANT IT kept me from experiencing this true difference to its most bloomed form. I also thought about all those moments lost in the limbo toxic hole of being NUMB after hurting through sex, like when I was not acknowledged by them again afterward or when I forced myself not to have sex even though it was probably a beautiful time to do it with someone or when I just laid there and forgot that sex was happening to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt used, nothing, everything, scared, deprived, restless, horny, asexual, invaded and bored that I stopped having sex actively for six months last year. It was at the peak of my wild feelings and out-of-control substance use and emotions that couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t be contained. But I let it go because I knew what it felt like and it didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t feel like what I needed and wanted to be healthy. I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know exactly what I wanted from sexuality, but I knew what I did not want from it and life. So, I cut those ties and I did not have sex even when I liked others, because, this time, it wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t because I liked them that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to get hurt or move </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too quickly,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it was because I actually had nothing to give and nothing I wanted to take. I was floating on in life and finding happiness in crevices that surprised me. I was reigniting my senses to feel and be awake to life all around where I once was taken from and not replenished. I was replenishing myself and understanding what I need from sex and what I can give. I also understood my selfish reasons for having sex before and the ways in which I put myself in situations continuously that were not in synch with my soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s true nature. I became me and I understood and respected what makes me most vibrant. I tried then to get to know other people, and for the first time, to get to know everyone as just a friend without the prospects of sex or love. I let go of using them to project my own fantasies onto and I tried to be less self-centered. They are all people. Beautiful, wondrous people, and I wanted to know who they were outside of sex or a buildup to it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were quite astonishing. They were wonderful. I fell in love with people again, and I fell in love with myself. I traveled and laughed. I ate and let go. I got full again, and I was ready to give when time allowed it. Since then I have had sex with one person and it was all very natural. I am living open to sexuality, but open to a redefined, reclaimed version of sexuality that includes so much nurturance, reciprocity, consent, respect, amusement, safety, excitement, fun and love that it will not be everywhere at any time. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a sexuality that is me and it is back and better than ever, even if it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s not always active in sex. It is always active inside of me. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/","id":6296,"author":{"id":408,"name":"Leilani Leila Riahi"},"related":[6295,6294,6293],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB GSA Formal Statement of Solidarity for Racial Equity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","description":"The Graduate Students Association of UC Santa Barbara stands in solidarity with student activists opposing discrimination on campuses around the country and taking political action to achieve equity o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Graduate Students Association of UC Santa Barbara stands in solidarity with student activists opposing discrimination on campuses around the country and taking political action to achieve equity on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We uphold UC’s principles of diversity, inclusivity, compassion and educational equity for all, and we expect the University to assist our and other students’ efforts to make these principles a reality.

According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interactive database of people killed by U.S. police, over 1,367 low-income individuals, predominantly people of color, were killed in 2015 alone. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, African Americans are incarcerated at 10 times the rate of white Americans. This, and other evidence­supported claims by the Black Lives Matter network(s) and associated movements, reveal a continuing, significant, disproportionately high level of violence against people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally disturbing is the rise of so-called “white student unions” that allege discrimination toward “people of European descent” and are, by definition, white supremacist hate groups. Allegations of “reverse discrimination” by white supremacists seek to shut down serious debate about the growing problem of institutional racism in our schools, courts, housing and local governments. In this manner, white supremacist organizations are attempting to hijack national debate on the murder of people of color through aggressive policing by instead alleging racial discrimination toward white people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at UCSB, the controversy concerning the establishment of an online white supremacist hate group has centered around whether or not it is a hoax and on whether or not any response to it constitutes an attack on free speech. Through alleging that any response constitutes an infringement of free speech, white supremacists are seeking to shut down criticisms of their racist organizations through automatic allegations of censorship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several local incidents of violence near our campus are additionally disturbing. In April 2015, Meagan Hockaday, an African-American woman and mother of three, was shot and killed by police officers in nearby Oxnard, CA. In September 2015, Black Lives Matter signs posted at St. Michaels University Church in I.V. were stolen, and the church’s plate glass door was shot out. In October 2015, the death of a Latino student in I.V. drew accusations of official misconduct by students who claimed authorities were too slow to respond to his life-threatening injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These and other incidents continue to create a tense environment in our community. This tension is compounded by white supremacists’ calls for a white student walkout and rally at the UCSB Multicultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, the UCSB GSA announces its formal opposition to this “white student union” and any other hate groups that predicate their cultural identity on violence and the denial of the multi­culturalism at the heart of our University.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We stand for and value compassion, empathy, diversity and the critique of privilege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We urge students to join us in solidarity against racism in all its manifestations on campus and in our communities, both locally and across the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We demand that university administration formally investigate this online white supremacist hate group in order to ascertain whether the motives for its inception violate the principles of community at UCSB, as well as our student and faculty codes of conduct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We additionally demand that university administration remain vigilant with regards to any such organizations appropriating our community and values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We finally demand that university administration actively protects students from harassment, stalking, cyber­stalking or any form of hate crimes and hate speech.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/","id":5775,"author":{"id":633,"name":"Graduate Students Association"},"related":[5774,5773,5772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Living Wages Left Out of Library Renovations","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/libraryopening-art.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/libraryopening-art.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the day of the grand opening of UCSB's new library, library employee Laurence Young asks us to look past the new building at the people working inside. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the recent completion of the Library Addition and Renovation project, it seems like a good moment to reflect on those areas still in need of attention. While the $76 million project has addressed some major needs of the campus and the library itself, there are still critical problems facing the staff who work in the building every day.</p>\n<p>A recent study by the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute found that 98.6 percent of UCSB clerical support staff do not make enough to support themselves and a child on their salary in the Santa Barbara area. The situation in the library is even worse. The library assistants who directly serve the campus community are hurt twice—first, by being forced to stay in an outdated job classification that does not reflect the high level of their professional library work, and then again as UCSB salaries are among the lowest of all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>In 2014 the library employed 82 library assistants who made, on average, $34,596.63. To put that in perspective, the median family income for Santa Barbara is $75,400. The EPI study calculated that you need $59,268 to meet your basic needs, and none of the library assistants received that kind of salary. Worse yet, 61 of these staff members meet the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s definition of low income.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite the fact that I have earned two master’s degrees from UCSB and that I am expected to resolve complex, research-related queries, during the first three years I worked in the library I was forced to rely on my retired mother for help each month with groceries. As I near 40 years old, it is deeply humiliating to be unable to support myself on the wages I earn.<br>\nI am humiliated to be in such a penurious state, but I am grateful that I have the family support structure to help me stay afloat. The stories I hear from my fellow co-workers who are in situations much worse than mine are humbling. One woman has her ex-husband and her grown children helping her meet her rent each month. Another colleague is in a situation like mine, receiving help from her retired parents, but had the added horror of needing to go on disability due to surgery. And of course there is the army of UCSB employees who live nowhere near Santa Barbara and commute more than an hour each way in order to make ends meet on their salary.</p>\n<p>These stories are legion amongst the library staff at UCSB, but they don’t describe what we do every day in service to the campus community. We are the public face of the library, helping you, our patrons, with everything from checking out materials and managing course reserves to opening the library every day and assuring that the information resources that our campus needs are accessible. We process new materials as they arrive and have the critical job of making sure that you can find them in the library catalog and on the shelves. We provide research and reference help throughout the various collections and we facilitate the complicated transfer of research materials from our off-campus annexes and other libraries around the world. We are the vital link between the collection, the librarians and you. We are a diverse and largely female workforce and we deserve a wage that we can live on independently.</p>\n<p>The University of California is the third largest employer in the state and the largest in Santa Barbara. With the recent increases in funding from state coffers and the resources to undertake major building projects like the Library Addition and Renovation, UCSB should be a force for economic growth, not a catalyst for the continuing evaporation of the middle class.</p>\n<p>Laurence Young has lived in Santa Barbara for 10 years and has earned two masters degrees from the UCSB Music Department. He has been employed as a full-time library assistant since 2012 and he is the UCSB Chapter Coordinator for the clerical workers union, Teamsters Local 2010.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/living-wages-left-out-of-library-renovations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/living-wages-left-out-of-library-renovations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/living-wages-left-out-of-library-renovations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/living-wages-left-out-of-library-renovations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/living-wages-left-out-of-library-renovations/","id":5774,"author":{"id":634,"name":"Laurence Young"},"related":[5773,5772,5771],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Catch a Fire: A Letter from the Bernie Sanders Campaign","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Bernie-Sanders.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Bernie-Sanders.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A letter from the Santa Barbara for Bernie 2016 campaign.

Long-presumed nominee for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, gets most of the media attention. But one of the other candidates vying for the Democratic Party nomination is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His campaign has been a spirited fight against corporate influence and corruption in politics. He speaks for the 99 percent and its struggle against the 1 percent. Sanders first entered politics in 1981 when he was elected the mayor of Burlington, VT. After serving for four terms as mayor, he ran for the at-large Congressional seat in Vermont in 1990 and won, serving eight terms. When a Senate seat opened up in 2006, Bernie ran and won, then was re-elected in 2012 by an astounding 71 percent of the vote. He is a champion of progressive causes, warns against a ruling oligarchy and has built his entire political career on fighting for social and economic justice.</p>\n<p>Since launching his campaign on May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Bernie Sanders has distinguished himself by not accepting Super Pac monies. He only accepts small, individual contributions, typically about $35 each. His efforts have raised enough money to remain viable in a campaign in which the Koch brothers will be throwing in over $900 million. Against this backdrop, we see that Sanders now draws thousands and thousands of people to his events and many of those people are not the old guard liberals, but young people — millennials, in college or out of college and coming to grips with a world that seems to be getting harder and colder. Many of them are burdened by student debt, that awful unshakeable millstone that threatens their future. Sanders offers a lot to these young people. His College for All Act calls for public college and university tuition to be free, paid for by a transaction tax on Wall Street (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock and a 0.1 percent fee on bonds). He wants work-study programs to be expanded and the student financial aid application process to be simplified. He has repeatedly called for a restructuring of student debt to lower interest rates and has even brought up the idea of eliminating student loan debt. Sanders’ philosophy of education is that it is a public good, not a private commodity, and as such should be available to all qualified applicants: Sanders states, “We live in a highly competitive global economy, and if our economy is to be strong, we need the best-educated workforce in the world.” These are just some of the reasons young people support a 74-year-old Democratic Socialist.</p>\n<p>Because today’s young people are not dumb, they can see that they’ve been screwed. They’ve seen their parents lose their houses. They know that good jobs and viable careers are scarce and getting scarcer. They can see the rapid centralization of wealth and power. They know that their future seems meaningless to the powerful — to the corporations and ultra-wealthy, corrupt politicians. And they know that the future of the world itself is being recklessly endangered by “conservatives” who deny science and global warming. Sanders is succeeding with young people because he’s speaking their language, honestly and from the heart. No focus groups or poll-tested responses needed. Again, these are not dim, unaware people absorbed by their cell phones. They have street smarts — they know when they’re being conned, and they know they’re not being conned by Bernie. Bernie represents the possibility of hope — this, the rarest of commodities these days.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There is an honesty and integrity to the man that is all but completely absent from the current political landscape. Everything has become a game; it has to be sold to the crowd the way refrigerators are sold to the customer. Sanders rejects this notion. Matt Taibbi, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine who has followed Sanders for years in his long career in Congress, says “… He’s not looking for a book deal or a membership in a Martha’s Vineyard golf club … This election isn’t a game to him … he genuinely believes the system is not beyond repair” (“The Case for Bernie Sanders” Rolling Stone, 11/03/15).</p>\n<p>Will young people become more involved — will they step up and turn the tide? It’s impossible to know, but there is a huge potential here for Sanders and for democracy. As he reminds us often, “No president, no leader, can do it without the people standing together.” Bernie Sanders has railed against the rising tyranny of the oligarchy which threatens this democracy. We think the new generation, particularly those in college, understand this. They are like a huge bonfire, laid and ready for a match — will it catch fire? We sure hope so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/catch-a-fire-a-letter-from-the-bernie-sanders-campaign/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/catch-a-fire-a-letter-from-the-bernie-sanders-campaign/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/catch-a-fire-a-letter-from-the-bernie-sanders-campaign/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/catch-a-fire-a-letter-from-the-bernie-sanders-campaign/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/catch-a-fire-a-letter-from-the-bernie-sanders-campaign/","id":6147,"author":{"id":632,"name":"Joanne Murray"},"related":[6146,6145,6144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Being In a Relationship Without Being In a Relationship: A Modern Magic Trick","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wed-hump-114.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wed-hump-114.png?resize=663%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sebastianne Kent talks a little love and relationships in this edition of The Wednesday Hump. Are you looking for someone special? You probably aren't alone.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re part of a generation that thinks feelings are toxic. “Catching feelings” is an expression that characterizes them as something bad as opposed to what drives much of humanity’s actions. As a result of this patho-phobia, as I’ve decided to call it, we’ve come up with a myriad of ways to expedite the hookup process. Tinder, Grindr and other apps make it so people who want hookups feel entitled to sex at first swipe, and the rest are looked down upon as a gross minority — those pariahs who’d dare want a relationship. At this point in time, marriages are expected to end in divorce, and your romantic first-date story has the same chance of taking place at a drunken party as in a cozy section of the library. Is it any wonder that we’re all terrified of commitment? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s intriguing is that within this framework of apps, websites and glory-holes to help you get yours, there are actually people who manage to be in functional relationships — they’ll just never admit it. It’s actually ingenious, and it’s probably sexist to assume that it was a man who first decided that friends with benefits was the best idea ever. Sex with no strings attached is the definition of the term at its barest, and it seems to have taken on a new role in our culture. We define our obsession with a slew of movies and shows that use the friends with benefits situation to sell us a fear of commitment. It appeals to men because they see a situation in which they don’t have to commit but get their end goal, and it appeals to women because the situations depicted often show a level of intimacy more associated with, well, actual relationships. When you begin to analyze our obsession with this whole affair, you start to see that the friends with benefits mechanism is a way to sell relationships to the commitophobes. Don’t most of those movies end with the couple in question admitting their feelings and starting a relationship? </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems as though a lot of people actually want more but are afraid to ask. If you doubt that you’re alone in wanting something more than just a one night stand, look at YikYak. The UCSB area looks like a sounding board for the lonely hearts club. At some point the definitions have shifted, and that’s the only explanation I can come up with. How can one be in an exclusive hookup? If it’s an exclusive hookup, it’s a relationship, just not as “serious” as it would be if two people had actually agreed to be in one. Now, on the eve of 2016, the relationship state of the union has changed. Fucking is the new hooking up, hooking up is the new relationship and dating is the new getting engaged. If you’re getting married you might as well be sewing yourselves together given how foreign it is to some of the people in our generation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to understand. Many of us are children of divorce, and we’ve been told our whole lives that 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, so a lot of us have probably taken the cautionary tales to heart and don’t want to get ourselves too tangled up. Even more relevant is that most recent heartbreak you had from dating young that made you say you weren’t going to be in a relationship until you were really ready. But having feelings for someone else is a sign you are ready, especially if you’re willing to forgo sex with other people to be with them, and even more so if you hang out with them outside of your bedroom. Those of us in a college town, especially one with a reputation like UCSB (whether or not it’s deserving) bear the brunt of this hookup culture atmosphere that permeates our generation. College is a place where you go to learn independence, which can definitely mean sleeping around and sampling what the best frats have to offer. But it can also mean learning about love in a less sheltered setting, dealing with a breakup and having to go to school or work and be strong without a parent or your best friend from home to help you do it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating in college, and actually calling it dating, provides us with valuable lessons we can’t learn later in life. If you forgo a relationship and deny your hookup any legitimacy, when you start dating as an adult, you’ll be jarred when relationships actually turn serious, and you’ve denied yourself the opportunity to dip your toes in the proverbial pool. College is fun, and so are hookups, but why deny yourself intimacy because you’re afraid you’ll get hurt? Life is about taking risks, and if you care about someone, don’t cheapen a relationship by saying you’re just hanging out. I guess to put it simply: Can’t we just admit we want to cuddle?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:

Ecosocialism is not an attempt to piggyback and steal the momentum of the global movement aimed at mitigating climate change in order to push a “red” agenda. Rather, ecosocialism aims for an economic system based on human need and the reduction of the gross inequalities that exist everywhere today — the socialism part — and emphasizes the ecological through respect and stewardship of our natural environment and lessening the devastating impact of our economic activity on the very basis of life. Ecosocialism is a rebalancing of the world — transforming society to a more ecocentric worldview. With a systemic analysis, we understand the crises of social inequalities and environmental catastrophe as inextricably linked. In the current political economic system of capitalism, where profit is the highest goal attained by growth at all costs, we see mass social inequalities and a devastated climate as symptoms of a systemic malady.</p>\n<p>As ecosocialists, we do advocate public ownership of utilities. We believe communities should be able to control their common resources. We can look at water as an example. Access to water is a right and not a commodity. When resources are privatized, they are often mismanaged by corporations who also create monopolies and raise rates. This is a common story told across the globe, from the Cochabamba Water War against Bechtel in Bolivia to Detroit’s water crisis, where rates had risen 119% over the last decade. We need to be able to make the decisions that affect our lives, and we do this through democratizing the decision making processes so that we can create a world built upon fulfilling our needs.</p>\n<p>Of the many troubling claims made by Mr. Garshfield, the most worrying to our member, fourth-year CCS biology major Henry Morse, was the claim that “scientists should not be making economic prognoses at all.” To argue that scientists should remain in their labs and out of public discourse has long been a technique used to keep the reality of our society’s ills hidden away from the public. Can we imagine what our country would be like if scientists like Rachel Carson (,who illuminated the dangers of the pesticide DDT,) hadn’t left their labs to speak out about the societal consequences of their work? Monsanto, the largest agri-business operation in the world, is poisoning the planet just by following its business model of maximizing growth and profit at the expense of our health, the livelihoods of farmers the world over and the possibility of our children inhabiting a livable environment. Just ask Neil Young, who tells this story on his most recent album the Monsanto Years.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor John Foran, one of the gathering’s organizers and a member of the national System Change Not Climate Change ecosocialist network (and an ardent fan of Neil Young’s music and activism) is singled out as possessing “no background in economics. Why does Professor Foran feel qualified to advocate a radical systemic overhaul in a field he does not even study?” This is a fair question, on the surface. Foran’s response,: “Jason seems to believe that one needs a doctorate in economics to be a critic of capitalism, while at the same time noting, ‘To economists, the success of capitalism is at least as much of a consensus as the existence of global warming is among climate scientists. They might debate the minutiae, but the major points are not in doubt.’ The point today is that the climate crisis has been caused by the normal operation of capitalism. Why then should we look to pro-capitalist economists to fix it? It was the great radical economist Kenneth Boulding who famously wrote that ‘Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.’ Boulding was president of the American Economic Association and made contributions to sociology, political science, social psychology and philosophy as a contributor to the approach known as General Systems Theory.”</p>\n<p>Jason misunderstands the “tragedy of the commons” as a critique of collective ownership of a common good, when public control over common goods like fresh water, clean air and the land that sustains our food production is in fact the solution to this problem. The tragedy of the commons is a problem generated by each individual maximizing his or her private good, a central tenet of free-market capitalism. The socialist Albert Einstein himself said that maybe we shouldn’t fix a problem with the system that created it.</p>\n<p>Jason also asserts that “when a good is private, people will be careful not to deplete the resource on their own property, because costs will be incurred by the individual actor.” Yet the reason that we have an unprecedented environmental crisis on our hands is that corporations do not have to pay the full costs of their operation in terms of either resources depleted or toxic waste and greenhouse gases produced, costs which economists tellingly refer to as “externalities.” Ecosocialists, whether trained economists or not, see this devastation of the natural world as “the second contradiction of capitalism” (the first being the cruel incentive of employers to drive down wages as much as possible).</p>\n<p>Growth at all costs, regardless of its effects on our earth and collective health, is a cornerstone of global capitalism today. Just this past month, Volkswagen, the world’s largest automobile manufacturer, admitted to rigging emissions tests in over 11 million cars. Cars were installed with devices that would direct a car’s engine to emit less pollutants, 98 percent less, during a test. What does it mean if VW, ranked most sustainable car maker in the world, is rigging its vehicles to pass emissions tests they would otherwise fail? The bottom line is green consumerism will not save us when profit is the driving force.</p>\n<p>We can argue that this is a case of a few greedy executives, some “bad apples,” but the case of green-washing (creating a false environmentally-conscious image by appropriating environmental concern to expand markets) can be seen across industries, including, most absurdly, the fossil fuel corporations that are the largest and richest the world has ever seen. And recently, ExxonMobil has been found to have <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/10/16/solo-arrest-bill-mckibben-spotlights-exxons-unparalleled-evil\">lied to the public</a> for years when its own scientists told its executives of the dangers of climate change.</p>\n<p>How do we start the desperately needed transition into a more just and sustainable system that rejects all socially and ecologically destructive systems, like patriarchy, racism, homophobia, transphobia and capitalism? What are the local measures we can take? How do we build people power and reclaim the right to make the decisions that affect our communities? These questions and others will be discussed at meetings of the UCSB System Change Not Climate Change group.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in these questions send an email to scnccsb@gmail.com for info on our next meeting. We invite Jason to attend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Women out there who read any kind of fashion magazine — and the men they sleep with — may be the first ones aware of changing trends, but as time goes on, word spreads, and we all become aware of developing trends for your down-there hair.</p>\n<p>The waves of change are puzzling in many cases, and one has to wonder if your choice of vulvar topiary really matters (probably not). However, things like merkins pubic wigs worn by actors as an attempt at modesty, or vajazzling, the motivations for which are mystifying unto themselves, are examples of the bizarre options the freedoms we have as Americans bring us.</p>\n<p>On shaving and waxing: The options for landscaping vary immensely, but if you’re doing any kind of management for your lady or man fur, the go-to options are shaving and waxing. We all know the potential issues with shaving — and the longer you do it, the more likely you are to have nasty side effects. It does seem that the general population at UCSB leans toward waxing, if only because you have to book B Boutique appointments two weeks in advance. The idea of spreading your legs for a stranger without a guaranteed orgasm is uncomfortable enough, but the pain of having hair ripped out of your body is much worse. The good news is the more you go, the less you grow, basically, and your hair follicles actually get smaller over time, which means less bush and more bonsai tree.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>These trends can be hard to follow even if you’re trying, and to be honest, who has the time? When you finally do get your “situation” in order, you realize that everything really can be politicized, including your personal grooming habits. Once you start shaving or waxing, that interim growing-out period turns into a time where you’re nervous about what whoever you sleep with will say. You have hair now: will they be okay with it? Your intention may be to get rid of it, but having it in the meantime turns into a source of insecurity because you may not know what their preferences are. Not everyone is lucky enough to run into the guy who thinks “half a centimeter is ideal,” because, due to porn (ah, the good and the evil of it!), most guys forget that we, too, are capable of growing hair in many places — even if we don’t necessarily want it there.</p>\n<p>This is a time when some women are dyeing their armpit hair neon colors, and hair’s relevance to our culture is emerging as various issues such as cultural appropriation and feminism intertwine; this is no less true for your curlies. I’m sure we’ve all heard of or met the woman who says the preferences of men will not dictate what she does with her body, and the man who says he doesn’t like it when women resemble a prepubescent girl rather than a mature vixen.</p>\n<p>We tell ourselves that we make grooming decisions based on what we want for our own bodies. It’s true that most women get dressed for themselves, or for other women if anything, and we claim that we make our grooming decisions for the most part because of personal preference. Hair that’s visible to everybody is more subject to influence by social milieus, but if you really ask yourself, I’m sure it’s a mixture of personal preference and what you’re worried someone will say. When you hear that everyone is shaving, trimming or pulling it off with wax strips, the insecurity can abound. If other people are used to it, you don’t want to be talked about after your hookup as “that gross girl who didn’t shave.” Not to mention guys don’t go down enough as it is — you may be afraid to give your guy another excuse not to.</p>\n<p>At its root, this is a feminist topic — Not the feminism that people misunderstand as man-hating raucous ideology, but the real feminism that advocates for equality between sexes and genders. You should be able to make any grooming decision you want, whether you decide you want to braid, wax, dye or stick jewels on your area — it’s up to you. The societal issue lies in the fact that you may become insecure when you’re waiting for hair to grow out between waxes because of what whoever sees you naked will say. Real equality would be being able to tell your boyfriend that you want him to wax into a landing strip and having him actually consider it because he knows it makes you happy, but outside of a relationship — where things like that may be up for discussion — you shouldn’t have to worry about what somebody else thinks. So take a deep breath, figure out what you want and go for it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/","id":6309,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6308,6307,6306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"An Awkward Wednesday Hump: Thursday Edition","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/unnamed.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/unnamed.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Our first Hump of the year!

I had some obvious expectations of how my first year would go, perpetuated by the “party school” stereotype. I thought there would be plenty of drinking, plenty of weed and a moderate amount of casual hook-ups. I didn’t expect all of this on my first night, but when in Rome …</p>\n<p>The night seemed to be going pretty normally. My friends and I went to a friend of a friend’s apartment; there was music and booze and boys. I was a happy camper. I was especially happy when one of these boys was actually talking to me. No, he wasn’t just talking to me. He was being nice to me. <em>Nice. </em>Of course, he offered to walk me back to my dorm and we found out we were both staying in FT (Stupid Fuck Towers). At this point, I was having a pretty good time. So when he asked if I wanted to watch “Harry Potter” with him, the only appropriate response in my mind was “Why wouldn’t I?” But let me tell you, Netflix and chill <em>is a trap.</em></p>\n<p>I sort of expected we would end up kissing, and I was cool with it. Our shirts were off and he wasn’t a terrible kisser. I thought it was going to be one of those average make-out sessions that you quickly forget (or try to forget) within a few weeks. Then, oh how sweet, he lays his hand against my neck and tells me I’m pretty. It could have been a scene from a shitty teenage rom-com. Until there was nothing romantic about it anymore. At first I was uncertain if it was really happening, but after about thirty seconds there was no mistaking it. This kid was choking me. Choking me. Tension in his hands and pressure against my trachea. Needless to say, I freaked out. I had one of those damn-it-my-parents-were-right moments. When I inquired of my partner his goal in strangling me, he said he was into BDSM and wanted to try it with me.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you’re anything like me, the only experience you have had with this mysterious sexual culture is a poorly-written “Twilight” fan fiction that took over popular culture this past Valentine’s Day season. Yes, I am referring to the infamous “Fifty Shades of Grey.” I’m sure the book series and subsequent movies have sparked interest in thousands of people. According to the highly credible magazine “Cosmopolitan,” S&amp;M is now making its way into the mainstream. After experiencing a glimpse into this realm firsthand, however, I thought I would look into the subculture a bit more.</p>\n<p>Once I filtered through the porn advertisements and strange google images, I actually found some surprising information. It turns out that BDSM (Bondage &amp; Discipline, Domination &amp; Submission, Sadism &amp; Masochism) has been growing in popularity over the last few decades. In 1953, Alfred Kinsey published “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.” One of his studies revealed that approximately half of the people who participated had been sexually aroused by having been bitten. A study published in 1999 by the German Institute for Rational Psychology found that 42 percent of women interviewed stated interest in BDSM techniques, while 25 percent were interested in bondage. In 2009, 39 percent of a sample of college-aged men stated they engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. And most recently, a 2014 study reported that 19 percent of male participants and 10 percent of female participants found sadistic scenarios described in the questionnaire at least “slightly arousing” when asked to rate their sexual appeal.</p>\n<p>However, I also found that this subculture stresses the importance of mutual respect and consent. Consent as an active conversation before and during any sexual activity in which partners discuss their fantasies and boundaries, to be more specific. Basically, you need to ask somebody if any sort of BDSM practice is okay with them before you start to practice with them. Without this conversation, somebody could think that you are trying to suffocate them while “Yer a wizard, Harry” is coming from your laptop. Yeah, we barely got through the first scene of the “Sorcerer’s Stone.” Even the seductive and successful Christian Grey was polite enough to give Anastasia a full orientation session, complete with a signed contract, and took her in a helicopter before touching her in any unconventional way.</p>\n<p>I learned two things from this interesting experience. First, I would highly recommend getting to know any potential partners before you go to their rooms in the middle of the night. And secondly, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is actually not quite as terrible as I previously thought. You guys should give it a chance if you haven’t already.</p>\n<p><em>Jordan Metz reminds you to see if your sexual partner consents to your kinks before getting down, especially if strangulation is your preferred foreplay. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/","id":6343,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6342,6341,6340],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/opinion","page":14,"highestPage":59}},"__N_SSG":true}
