Don’t believe me? I asked a focus group of fellow Gaucho girls and asked, “How many sexual partners have you had? How many of them gave you orgasms?” The answer — as expected — was largely disparate.</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"86256\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/fuck-yourself-this-valentines-day/sex-toys-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1.jpg?fit=304%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"304,474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sex toys 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1.jpg?fit=304%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86256 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1-160x250.jpg?resize=176%2C275\" alt=\"\" width=\"176\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-1.jpg?w=304&amp;ssl=1 304w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the seven women interviewed, three of the girls had more than 10 sexual partners, and not even half of their partners led them to orgasm (between one and two partners made them come). On the other end of the spectrum, four girls had more than 30 partners and experienced orgasm less than 10 percent of the time (1-3 of their partners).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here’s more science to back me up. In the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Survey_of_Sexual_Health_and_Behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than 1000 adults were asked about their most recent sexual experience, and the results showed that 91 percent of the men climaxed during their encounter, compared to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only 62 percent of women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So is climaxing all that important during for women during sex? I asked the focus group, “Is orgasm necessary for you to consider a sexual experience good?” Most of their answers: No. “It’s fun and exciting for me to be intimate in general. I don’t have to reach an orgasm to enjoy the sex,” one participant explained. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is fine!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let’s compare this to how important it is for men to finish. If a guy doesn’t climax during sex, women often feel guilty. A lack of a male orgasm may be perceived as something being “wrong” with you or him. But when the roles are reversed its supposed to be “all good”?</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"86258\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/fuck-yourself-this-valentines-day/sex-toys-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=377%2C471&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"377,471\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sex toys 4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=377%2C471&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-86258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4-200x250.jpg?resize=200%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?resize=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not going to bore you with the history behind this double standard or waste time right now explaining why women should orgasm just as much as men (they should, but that’s an entirely different article).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this lovey-dovey, card and chocolate crap-filled day, take the time to love yourself!

Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant. However, when giving oral sex all eyes are completely on you. In most cases, if someone isn’t nutting it’s pretty easy to find who’s to blame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, tackling my first dick seemed like a daunting task.

I found out that many girls did not receive the thorough education I thought was necessary for success. Most girls simply repeated the golden rule: no teeth. But other than that, most advice was to “just kinda go for it.” When they reflected on their experiences, the consensus seemed to be that they didn’t believe this lack of education hindered their ability to perform or caused them any more anxiety than normal during their first experience. Personally, I think hindsight blurs the anxiety they felt preceding the act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued the conversation with my blowjob virgin friends, who all agreed that receiving a thorough how-to walkthrough would significantly decrease their anxiety. Most of these girls told me that they had gleaned what little knowledge they had from brief conversations with friends, or from articles in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the like. We discussed the merits of these articles and they told me how they didn’t feel like they could trust the information between the glossy pages of a national magazine when performing such an intimate act. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant. However, when giving oral sex all eyes are completely on you.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this talk about blowjobs and education got me thinking about how our society approaches sexual education. Sex is such a popular topic in our culture; it’s used in advertisements to sell products, it’s shown in movies and music videos, it’s discussed in the media, news and politics. But amidst all this, there’s so little discussion about sex that occurs outside of heterosexual penetrative acts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly about the details of oral sex, or sex that falls outside of the heterosexual binary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this lack of information fueling a culture which shames these acts? After considering all of the knowledge gained from examining my own experiences, discussing the experiences of others, and pondering how our society educates the masses on this topic, I’ve come to the conclusion that the fear women feel in performing oral sex comes from a culture of embarrassment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think women should be proud of their ability to please their partner.

Though attitudes towards tattoos have slowly shifted as the number of people getting inked increases, their acceptance in the workplace is still in question for managers and millennials seeking jobs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many, tattoos are nothing more than a meaningful memento or method of self-expression.

This association, rooted in racial and cultural stereotypes, needs to be left in the past. In the modern American workplace, tattoos should not play a role in hiring decisions. Because the population of people with tattoos is growing, having workers with tattoos not only will foster an environment of acceptance for workers but for customers as well. Furthermore, if managers are limited to hiring people without tattoos, they could potentially limit their workforce.</span></p>\n<p>“My tattoo is really special to me,” said first year Emerson Stewart. “It reminds me of my family and what they have done for me.” Just below his right arm, over the crooks of his rib cage is a swallow. “It commemorates the boating trips where I learned to appreciate my family more, discovered a deep respect for the ocean, and grew a lot as a man.” Tattoos have become a form of expression and often serve as reminders of the places and people we love.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Both of my parents had tattoos and when I turned 18, my birthday present was my tattoo. Both of my sisters have multiple as well. In our family, our tattoos are symbolic of what’s important to us and what we value,” said third year Tayla Kelley. “I currently have six and each one has its own story that makes me who I am today. Whenever I see them, it’s a reminder to myself of what’s important to me and helps keep me grounded in a way. They’re reminders of everything I’ve been through and everything I’ve lost, but they remind me of what I still have as well.” It is these intricacies and the elusive beauty of tattoos like Kelley’s and Stewart’s that often evade the realm of consideration in the workplace.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it becoming more common for people to have sentimental tattoos, but it is also more common for people to have tattoos in general. According to a</span><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2008/12/09/tattooed-gen-nexters/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted by the Pew Research Center, more than 1 in 3 “Gen Nexters” or Americans ages 18-25 have expressed themselves in terms of appearance, tattoos being the most popular form. For any company, having a diverse, representative staff can improve business. However, to that end, some argue that having staff members who are heavily tattooed could decrease business because customers may have an inherent negative reaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also something to be said about a manager’s discretion in setting a dress code. Ideally, a manager has chosen a dress code that they feel is fitting for their business and the customers they will be serving. In terms of tattoos, there is the subjective questioning of obscenity and location. While I do believe there is more of a consensus on what is obscene or offensive, I believe there is less certainty in restricting the location of tattoos. Someone with a face tattoo that is not obscene may find it more difficult to be hired than someone else with a less visible tattoo such as one on the hand or wrist, and while I would venture to say that the average person bearing a face tattoo isn’t trying to get a job at your local haberdashery, it is important to question where the line should be drawn. For argument’s sake, I believe obscenity should be up to a manager’s discretion, while extreme locations such as the face or neck should be evaluated relative to other qualifications.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This association, rooted in racial and cultural stereotypes, needs to be left in the past. In the modern American workplace, tattoos should not play a role in hiring decisions. Because the population of people with tattoos is growing, having workers with tattoos not only will foster an environment of acceptance for workers but for customers as well.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a final point, hiring managers who discriminate against job candidates with tattoos may be settling for a less-qualified pool of applicants. Because there is a growing population of people with tattoos among the younger generation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in fact, 1 in 3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a manager who will only consider applicants without tattoos is decreasing the pool of candidates by more than 30 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality of tattoos in the workplace is that although there is a movement towards more acceptance, body adornments can inevitably play a role in hiring decisions because it is ultimately at the manager’s discretion whether or not they will hire someone with tattoos. Because restricting tattoos can limit the potential of a workforce, and the number of people with tattoos in America has significantly increased, I argue that we re-evaluate the culture and judgements of tattoos. We are now in a time where we can foster an environment that allows for a reclamation of this form of self-expression.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryana Kamelian wants you to rethink your initial impressions of tattooed workers.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86055\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86055\" data-attachment-id=\"86055\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/tattoo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=2500%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tattoo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=800%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86055\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo-195x250.png?resize=269%2C345\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=768%2C983&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=800%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86055\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makena Sumi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many things about tattoos that I love. I love that they are a way of learning things about the people who are in possession of them, that they are a beautiful form of artwork and, most of all, that they provide a means of taking ownership of your own body. However, there are valid reasons why visible body art is considered inappropriate in a professional work setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that tattoos can present ideas or symbols that are offensive to others. Though it’s probably safe to say that my blue butterfly tattoo won’t offend anyone I might encounter in the workplace, it can’t be guaranteed that every tattoo is not an offensive statement or symbol. Because of this, it is probably best to limit tattoos in the work setting altogether rather than single people out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One extreme example would be a swastika tattooed on someone’s arm. While freedom of speech protects this person’s right to have this tattoo, I think we can all agree that this symbol is very offensive to others and is not an image that most companies want greeting a person when they are, say, grabbing their morning coffee. While most tattoos do not depict images that are so blatantly socially unacceptable as this one, there are many subtle images that can cause a client to feel uncomfortable when approaching a worker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I don’t desire to be judged by those around me based on their perceptions of my tattoos. Countless studies indicate that first impressions have a lasting effect on relationships. I wouldn’t want a coworker or client making decisions about who I am as a person based on a piece of artwork. I would rather represent myself through my actions and words than through a tattoo. In the end, no one but you knows the true meaning of the images on your body, and while you might not mean to insult anyone with your tattoo, its meaning might be very easily misconstrued.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as visible tattoos have become more commonplace and diminishingly associated with low-brow culture, the image of a tatted body might clash with the desired appearance of the company. Considering that employers are paying workers to represent their companies, it is not too much to ask that workers display the sort of image that employers desire.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along these lines, studies indicate that although showing body art has become a common trend, the presence of tattoos continues to be a limiting factor in the hiring process. A 2014 </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0950017014528402\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> determined that hiring managers are still concerned about how visible tattoos will affect a client’s opinion of an employee. Additionally, a 2015 </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698915301247?via%3Dihub\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed that clients still tend to have an aversion to front-of-house employees with tattoos. There is a very simple solution to this issue — get your tattoos done on your torso or thigh instead of your arm, and having art on your body becomes a nonissue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as it has become more mainstream to sport visible tattoos, the law has always backed an employer’s right to enforce rules concerning the presence of tattoos. In many cases, employees have cited anti-discrimination and freedom of speech in cases attempting to fight employer’s policies. However, the courts have maintained that it is an employer’s right to determine policy regarding the presence of body art. Employers reserve the right to control the image of their companies, which includes whether or not their workers show tattoos. Even as visible tattoos have become more commonplace and diminishingly associated with low-brow culture, the image of a tatted body might clash with the desired appearance of the company. Considering that employers are paying workers to represent their companies, it is not too much to ask that workers display the sort of image that employers desire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is important to acknowledge that as tattoos become more prominent in popular culture, their presence tends to be associated less with the outlandish counterculture they once represented, especially among the younger audience. Also, it is not fair to assume that every tattoo is a statement that might offend someone. Many tattoos are beautiful pieces of artwork, names, dates or statements that have sentimental value to their owners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given this information, the presence of tattoos in the workplace should be up to the discretion of the staff supervisor. Taking all this into account, it is important to consider the consequences a tattoo might have on your desired career before heading to the tattoo parlor. </span></p>\n<p><em>Melanie Ziment wants people to think twice before getting inked. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/","id":5613,"author":{"id":367,"name":"Aryana Kamelian"},"related":[5612,5611,5610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Studying Abroad Improved My Mental Health","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2019-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tiffany-velasquez-art-e1549020265274.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tiffany-velasquez-art-e1549020265274.jpg?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the Menu Editor Tiffany Velazquez discusses how studying abroad in Bristol, England has impacted her mental health. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My sophomore year of college was the hardest year of my life. Following a surgery that left me in recovery for the better part of the summer, I returned to a campus that I had yet to find my place in for my second year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked my way through roughly nine months of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) appointments, my idealism and romantic notions about college long forgotten. And yet, I found in myself a sense of strength and resilience forged from the hardships I had been forced to overcome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending most of my time exploring Goleta and Santa Barbara by myself that year led not only to abundant self-reflection but also to an improved GPA as a result of focusing all my energy and frustration into my schoolwork. I didn’t realize until that following summer that I had improved enough to feasibly consider studying abroad for my final year, a dream I had long since abandoned as various factors seemed to work against me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My third year of college was significantly better, as I discovered my niche in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">office under Storke Tower and worked my way up to become the On the Menu editor. But after three years at UCSB, I had removed my rose-tinted glasses and realized that this school did not hold the same place in my heart that it did for so many others — and that despite having good friends, I needed to spend some time somewhere else.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Now, after months of paperwork and panicking about what I was about to embark on devoid of any safety net, I find myself reflecting on my experience thus far in my room at the University of Bristol, England. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I was on the phone with my mom, talking about how much time had already passed, that I realized how unmistakably happy I was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had come to England with the mindset that I would step fully out of my shell, challenging myself to overcome my social anxiety and make the most of my three months here. And somehow, that’s exactly what I did. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I talked to everyone I could and accepted as many invitations to go out as possible, spending very little time in my flat during those initial weeks. I was doing so well that after introducing my flatmate to my group of study abroad friends, she made a comment about how extraverted I seemed to be. For someone who had spent the majority of her college years in her room, it was a marker of just how far I had come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my happiness here to my fellow UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) students, five of whom are possibly the greatest people I have ever met. Despite telling ourselves that we wouldn’t only hang out with other Americans, I still find myself spending most of my days with them. From impromptu pub crawls to week-long study sessions, I usually see them all at least once a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I write this, I just came back from a weekend spent in Dublin with fifteen other students, thanks to a large group chat that we somehow formed during our international orientation and kept expanding ever since. This Friday I leave for Edinburgh before setting off to Barcelona the next weekend and to London a few days after.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire experience seems so surreal; I had spent so long thinking that studying abroad was nothing more than a dream. If I was homesick in Santa Barbara, which was only a two-hour drive from my home in Huntington Park, how would I ever survive the over five-thousand-mile distance between home and Bristol? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most surprising thing about studying abroad has been the significant improvement to my mental health. Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the summer, right before I was supposed to leave, I hit a wall: my anxiety devolved into a case of a depression that made it hard to leave the bed sometimes. I was beginning to doubt my decision to go abroad without anyone I knew by my side.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has undoubtedly changed how we communicate for the better. We now have the power to reach people on the other side of the world and learn about current events almost instantly. We use texting and social media to keep in contact with acquaintances and loved ones. We send kissy-face emojis to show affection and write happy birthday on our friends’ timelines. I live hundreds of miles away from my best friends and family members, yet I feel as close to them as ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, texting and the like has also created a dimension of communication that has never existed before — a type of communication that doesn’t require any words at all. Apple has dominated the electronic world for years now. Almost every single person we know owns one an Apple phone (unless you’re a fringe Android user). Centered at the forefront of modern communication, Apple was the first to create an option to show if the person you are texting has read your message. Now, apps like Facebook and Instagram have followed this trend and automatically use read receipts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is ridiculous, I know I am not the only one who gets extremely butthurt, for lack of a better word, when I see someone has read my message and chosen to not respond. My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me? I thought we were close but I guess not…. It’s as if a switch in my mind has been turned on and I frantically worry my relationship with this person is now suddenly different. Usually, the next time I see him or her I will realize that I was over-exaggerating and that switch will be turned right back off. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mysteriousness of not knowing whether someone has just skipped over your text on accident or is purposefully ignoring you is beautiful in my eyes.

I will read someone’s message and absorb all of the information, then completely forget to respond until five days later. Sometimes, I don’t respond on purpose. I simply just don’t have anything to say in response or get overwhelmed by the constant need to be connected with others. I want to sit with my thoughts for a couple days, or even hours, and respond when I am ready. Hypocritically, when I do this, of course it is harmless or a simple mistake. But then others do the same, I want to curl up in my room and never come out.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong?

We’ve all received a “k.” response or interpreted a message with ten exclamation marks as overbearing and off-putting. It has been found that </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2012/02/01/people-are-more-likely-to-lie-through-text-messages-study-finds/37388961/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people are much more likely to lie through text versus talking face-to-face or an audio or video chat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The problem is that emotions cannot be interpreted as effectively without observing facial expressions and verbal tones. Read receipts reinforce this ambiguity when they leave the sender questioning what went wrong. Life was less complicated when people were forced to communicate face-to-face. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, let’s all agree that technology is confusing enough and leave read receipts behind.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally McCulloch encourages everyone to stop obsessing over read receipts. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85873\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85873\" data-attachment-id=\"85873\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/argument-in-the-office-the-merits-of-read-receipts/img_4696/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4696\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85873\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696-250x250.jpg?resize=396%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read receipts on messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp or Facebook have become a contentious topic among users since day one. While many of my friends voice their contempt for this whole level of passive aggressive messaging, I have always appreciated the credible information of the read receipt option whether that is proof for my friend’s ignorance or the clear message of my brother’s disinterest. And let’s be honest, feeding our relationship mind games, our inner control demons just want to know whether someone has read our messages or ditched us again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a private chat, my experience is that read receipts also positively impact conversation flows and response time. Once you have opened a message your partner is notified, so you are nudged into responding instantly. Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. And it is even more effective than not replying without the function. You can now avoid uncomfortable rejections or half-hearted conversations by signalling apparent disinterest without utilizing the power of words. It is essentially the straightforward way of finally “telling” your stalking admirer to bugger off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from facilitating the inconvenient task of giving someone the brush-off, I am convinced that read receipts convey a deep feeling of community and connection. Most people underestimate the reliability in planning and the lack of the feeling of insecurity provided by the function. This applies not only to meeting your date but also in group messages when you spontaneously decide to move your party from your friend’s house to Bill’s Bus on a Thursday night. Also, who has not experienced the beauty of immediate bonding when you text someone for the first time and you see they have the read receipt function as well? I kid you not, it is just mind-blowing to feel this deep connection of living life on the same page with your fellow iPhone buddies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want technology in general and the read receipt function in particular to control your deepest fears, you can either go on a life changing phone detox or choose options to read messages without triggering the read receipt. But let’s face it, the detox is probably just one of many new year’s resolutions we won’t fulfil this year so let’s stick to alternatives that include keeping our instruments of sin in our pockets.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we are a student newspaper dedicated to improving student communication for overall happiness and love I would like to end by offering some exclusive sneaky alternatives to circumvent read receipts for y’all: First, the screen pull-down technique allows you to read texts without triggering receipts so you are not pressured to reply at all and your conversation partners are for once not crying themselves to sleep. For our bougie Tim Cook supporters, a.k.a. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owners of an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus: You guys can use the new Peek feature to view your screen without triggering the function.

Although I had been eagerly awaiting the adventure since I sent in my application to study abroad, I have to admit that spending my birthday without my friends and family hit harder than I thought it would. As someone with minimal international travel experience, navigating major airports and traveling out of the country solo equated to a great deal of confusion, stress and, at times, tears — sometimes all three at once! However, two layovers and a panicked moment of thinking I’d lost my carry-on in Switzerland later, I had arrived at my final destination: a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never heard of the country of Cyprus before, don’t worry — I hadn’t either. Last fall, as I looked through the different study abroad programs available, my decision-making process could be summarized as follows: What is Cyprus? Is this… a country? It’s on the EAP website, so it has to be a country. Probably. Where is it? Oh, Google says it’s an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Sweet, I’m going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to hearing of my study abroad destination for the upcoming fall, most family and friends replied with either, “Cyprus?

To put it into perspective, Cyprus is approximately 9,251 square kilometers with a population of about 1 million people, while the United States is approximately 9,833,517 square kilometers with about 323 million more people. However, despite its small size, the country has managed to fill itself with a wide variety of impressive sites and excursions. From exploring the sea caves and cliff jumping at Cape Greco in Ayia Napa to hiking in the Troodos Mountains and seeing small patches of snow, I’ve only just begun to describe the range of activities that can be found on the island. When you have a moment, feel free to Google “Blue Lagoon” in Cyprus. Yes, that’s real. And yes, it’s even more stunning in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Cyprus is more than just a pretty place. Located at the maritime crossroad of three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa), the small island has a robust history spanning 10,000 years. Throughout its existence, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Lusignans, Genoese, Venetians, Ottomans, Britons and Turks have all sought to take the island for themselves. Currently, Cyprus remains divided with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds run by the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government. In order to visit Northern Cyprus, I had to cross a border with my passport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, more surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me. Despite not speaking a word of Greek, or even knowing substantial information about the country upon arrival, the culture shock I’d anticipated was pretty much nonexistent. Honestly, I kind of relate to the Cypriots’ horrendous parking skills. When I think about the fact that the biggest obstacle I’ve faced so far has been trying to explain what tofu was to the employees at the grocery store, I become aware of just how lucky I am to have stumbled upon this island. Sometimes, I can’t believe that two months have passed by already. I really don’t want to think about how I’ll have to leave my new home in just one month.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of where you decide to study abroad (if you have the opportunity to do it, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), finding your new family will undoubtedly be the best part. There are truly no other people I would rather sprint through both the Frankfurt train station and airport with in order to make our flight or sit through a cold and drizzly six-hour ferry ride from Athens to Naxos with. If you somehow have the fortune to find the right group of people to create a family dinner rotation, to be your travel buddies, to be the reason why a foreign country can somehow be called home, then you’ll understand why I hold this small island so close to my heart. There’s a reason why they say that home isn’t a place, it’s a person — or, in this case, ten people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though some loved ones still send me messages asking, “How is Cypress?” the country’s anonymity only adds to its charm. I’ll miss everything this underrated country has to offer: from the spinach and feta cheese pies to the sweet dog I pass by every day on my way to campus to the memories that will truly last a lifetime. My biggest takeaway from studying abroad is that with an open mind and an open heart, anywhere in the world can become home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu encourages students to consider studying abroad somewhere unorthodox. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

Of course, I kept in mind that salads were a healthy alternative to hamburgers, but I nevertheless enjoyed late nights at In-N-Out with my friends from time to time. I ate primarily balanced meals at home and enjoyed dessert in moderation. My day-to-day life was always filled with physical activity. I rode my bike five miles to school every morning, dog-walked four times a week to make a little extra money, taught children’s dance classes and then took my own classes as well. On weekends, I would take hikes with my friends and family as well as go running atop the hill behind my house. Thus, I never put too much thought into the foods I was eating because all of my physical activity balanced out the food that I would consume.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85449\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85449\" data-attachment-id=\"85449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-07/a-revived-relationship-with-food/food-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85449\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article-188x250.jpg?resize=269%2C358\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jessica Bixby / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going to college was the first time in my life that I would be living away from home. I would now have many new responsibilities, one of them being managing my own food. Fully wary of the freshman 15, I decided to pay close attention to my diet and exercise routine in order to avoid falling into this common fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, my plan bore nothing but favorable</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effects. I ate fruit with my breakfast each morning and made sure to balance every lunch and every dinner with a salad. I enjoyed checking UCSB NetNutrition before serving myself in the dining commons, just to be knowledgeable about the ingredients I was putting on my plate. I began drinking more water and tried to exercise every other day. These were all positive changes in that they got me into a healthy routine among a time of such great change. My skin became clearer and I no longer fell into exhausted slumps after eating as I sometimes would after consuming those heavy In-N-Out burgers. I had never really paid attention to nutrition while living at home, so I felt a mature sense of agency through being able to control the way in which I was powering my body. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these were positive changes to begin with, the goodness was not to last. My careful attention grew into an all-encompassing obsession that bled into every aspect of my life in innumerable negative ways. The health-conscious decisions that started as choices became rules to be followed at all costs: Always drink coffee before breakfast to suppress appetite. Never eat meat. If there is a low-cal alternative, always choose it. Bread, pasta and and rice are all absolute no’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking NetNutrition became the definitive criteria for picking a dining hall. If my friends invited me to Ortega but Carillo served more balanced options, I would formulate some lie explaining why I could not join them, then walk all the way around the lagoon alone in order eat a light meal of low-calorie polenta topped with microgreens. I was never one to skip class in high school, nor at the beginning of college. However, as my fixation progressed, my priorities began to change. If I knew that I would be expected to eat cake for a friend’s birthday that evening, I would skip class in order to make time to exercise so that what I burned would balance out what I ate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighing myself became as much a part of my daily routine as brushing my teeth. I tracked every calorie I ate down to a pinch of vegan parmesan atop my zoodles. I fidgeted throughout all my lectures because sitting still meant minimal calorie burn and minimal calorie burn was bad. When not in lecture, I could be found on a Rec Cen elliptical, pushing my undernourished body to its max. Though I was already quite lean upon entering college, by the end of my freshman year, I had lost 15 percent of my body weight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these behaviors arose when I went away to college, they did not cease when I returned home for the summer. I remember getting invited to a pizza party by a dear high school friend. Although I had no plans for that evening and had not seen my high school friends in six months, I declined the offer. I valued saving the calories by staying home alone more than sharing pizza and good times with friends. The few times I did see my friends, they noted my weight change and concernedly questioned my well-being. I blamed the “pesky dorm plague” for my lack of appetite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that my tendencies were detrimental to my everyday life, but I was so fixated upon the number on the scale that I didn’t care. I stopped getting my period, stopped enjoying spending time with friends and stopped caring about things that were non-food-related.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was one thing, however, that my fixation did not destroy: my dream of studying abroad. After only a few days in Paris for a family vacation when I was 10, I became infatuated by the French language, music and way of life. Since then, I aspired to spend my junior year of college sipping warm espressos reading </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le Petit Prince</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in cozy cafés.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck with elation upon receiving my acceptance email from the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) for the University of Bordeaux’s study abroad program. In a few short months, my decade-long dream would finally materialize. Yet, before departing, I would have to fill out all the mandatory paperwork, one of which was the housing preference form.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My options were single apartment, shared apartment and homestay. Pondering these options, my head began to swirl. I knew that living in a homestay with a French family would be the best way for me to truly experience the French culture in which I so yearned to be immersed. However, choosing a homestay meant living by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">someone else’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rules, adhering to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> schedule and, by all means, eating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food. I shuddered at the idea of willingly forfeiting my diet of kale smoothies, cauliflower rice and tofu scrambles for the rich, creamy, meat-heavy, veggie-lacking French cuisine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite my fear of gaining weight and renouncing all the “healthy changes” I had made during my first two years of college, I did not want to let my obsession tarnish my long-held dream. I checked the homestay box on the form, then closed my laptop with trembling hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I arrived at my homestay, I walked into a home very different from what I was used to; it was exactly what I had dreamed of and more. My host mother’s dwelling was classic Bordelaise, crafted of white limestone and furnished with sun-faded vintage wood. Verdant plants surrounded the living room piano, and books with yellowed pages bound to cracking spines filled the shelves. Her kitchen had 50 of everything — spoons, forks, knives, bowls, plates, cups, wine glasses — and with these abundant apparatuses, she had delicately prepared an exquisite dish of spaghetti Bolognese to welcome me. When I saw the steaming plate on the table, my excitement extinguished in a snap. Red meat, olive oil and carb-heavy spaghetti — it was three evils in one, all teaming up on me to corrupt my regimen. Nevertheless, I knew that sharing the meal was the right thing to do. I pushed aside my thoughts and got to know my host mother over our plates. Her warmth made me feel welcome and comfortable, and my anxiety about the food began to slip away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my first few weeks, each meal felt like a mountain to be scaled. Yet, after reaching the summit and laying my cutlery aside my plate, I felt not accomplishment, but guilt. However, over time, I learned to enjoy the view. The creaminess of warm-buttered purée, the tantalizing juices of duck confit and the heavy richness of quiche Lorraine … These are all plates that I never would have dreamed of tasting before studying abroad but now cannot imagine my experience without. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I enjoyed the new flavors and began to seek out more. After hearing that France’s best-rated viennoiserie was situated in Bordeaux, I eagerly took a special trip downtown to sample its chocolatine. On a weekend trip to Lyon, France’s gastronomic capital, I eagerly tasted the buttery culinary specialty of foie gras. Throughout my study abroad experience I sampled canel</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">és, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the classic Bordelaise pastry flavored with rum and vanilla, from multiple shops, in order to discover the best one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My newfound joy for food spilled over into other facets of my life. I rediscovered interests which had been so long ignored while I was carefully counting the cherry tomatoes on my salad and logging them into my calorie-counting app. I now had the time to create things and started writing a blog about my study abroad adventures. I went out to bars with friends and ordered the drinks that looked appealing to me — even if they were made with non-diet tonic water! I spent lazy Saturday mornings reading poetry in my sunlit living room, fidget-free and entirely content. I finally saw the value in a life centered around the pursuit of joy instead of a quest to fit into double zero jeans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on the past four months, I am astounded at how much I’ve changed. Living with a French host family incentivized me to stray from my “perfectly clean diet” in order to create true familial connections. Being surrounded by a gastronomy-centered society prompted me to let down my guard surrounding food in order to experience its cultural beauty in entirety. Thus, studying abroad gave me more than just change of scenery; it also allowed me a change in the way I view my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d be lying if I said that my conscience doesn’t sometimes flicker when I take a bite of chocolate cake. But the relics of my past mentality never trump my newfound desire to engage in life’s pleasures. I love food, as well as the countless lessons and connections that it can bring. Thus, I have no reservations swallowing my rules in order</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to fully digest life.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein seeks to inspire anyone and everyone to experiment with new flavors.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.

After three years at UC Santa Barbara, I felt as though I was prepared academically, professionally and emotionally to go live and work in a city for the summer. Plus, the current political climate made me angry. I wanted to take a stand against Trump’s unjust and corrupt policies, and DC seemed like a good place to start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a young woman under Trump’s Administration, politics is personal. Sometimes I struggle explaining how Trump getting elected impacted me, and I’m sure many other women, at this level. Granted, I am a straight white woman, and honestly, a lot of Trump’s policies will have a lessened effect on me because of my privilege. But when Trump became president I realized that I had underestimated how deeply rooted sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia and other forms of hate are in this country. Watching Hillary, an unarguably more qualified, more poised, more experienced candidate get belittled by a cruel, inexperienced, loud-mouthed man, and ultimately lose to him, hurt me. It’s impossible for me to look at that election and not see the sexism that is at play in it. It wounded my individual sense of womanhood and left me feeling discouraged about the post-college world I was preparing to enter.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85389\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85389\" data-attachment-id=\"85389\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/ucdc-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85389\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?resize=650%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to move to DC for the summer to make a political impact, no matter how minor.

One particularly rewarding task for me was answering constituent phone calls. Early on in my internship we started receiving hundreds of calls about the family separations at the border. Many people who called had never called their representative before, but did so because they were so heartbroken and angry. Just listening to them and assuring them that I would make note of their opinion so the Congressman could respond gave them relief. Even though I couldn’t promise these constituents that the border separation would end, I could make their voices heard by listening to them. I felt like I was helping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another moment that helped shape my time in DC was what I learned when I attended the Women’s Congressional Staff Association Conference. I listened to many women from all different backgrounds who had successful careers in politics speak. I was rather surprised, honestly, to learn that more than half of them were Republicans. They spoke passionately about being a woman or woman of color in politics, and how unacceptable female representation in Congress is. Female representation, and women’s rights more generally, isn’t an ideal I see represented in Trump or his administration. But that doesn’t mean it’s not an important ideal to many Americans, on both sides of the aisle.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn’t have found a better internship or community and I felt like every single day I was doing something that mattered.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first week in DC, my friend and I saw the musical “Hamilton” at the Kennedy Center. A lot of the themes in the musical came to characterize my time in DC, and hopefully the future of our country as well. One of the lines sang throughout the musical is, “Look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.” The characters weren’t saying this because life was perfect, in fact it was quite the opposite; they were in the middle of fighting the American Revolution. But they felt lucky to be alive because they saw so much opportunity and hope. And that’s really how I feel about our country right now. Trust me, it really does feel like shit is about to hit the fan a lot of the time, but when I look at other people who are angered by Trump, angered by inequality, angered by all the bullshit that is going on right now, I see an incredible opportunity for change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience in DC exceeded my expectations on every level. I couldn’t have found a better internship or community and I felt like every single day I was doing something that mattered. So I want to encourage all of you, no matter what you study or where you are in your academic careers, that if you’re angry about the state of our country right now, there is something you can do about it, no matter how small. Don’t be discouraged by the vastness of the problem. And lastly, judging by the results of the House election, collectively we took a small, but important, step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Garrett encourages students who want to make a difference to consider the UCDC program. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/","id":5647,"author":{"id":823,"name":"Sarah Garrett"},"related":[5646,5645,5644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pursue Your Passion or Please Your Parents?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Hyphenated American","publish_date":"2018-12-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"What if the life you envision for yourself doesn't match up with the one your parents envision for you?

It’s the way they were told they would find success. It’s what my parents did. They studied hard, went to a good college and, when they had the opportunity, they moved to the United States to make a better life for themselves. And when they were able to support themselves and my brother and me, they started sending money back to India to support their family back home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve been lucky enough to be able to visit India frequently, and over the years, I’ve seen how my parents have been able to give back to their parents and siblings there. On my dad’s side of the family, his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nephews and nieces were able to move out of a one-bedroom apartment with his help. Two of my cousins have now moved to the U.S. to get their master’s degree, with his help. My mom was able to help her sister build her own hospital in Hyderabad and help her brother-in-law run for office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently joke about how Indian people only view three careers as options for their children: doctor, lawyer and engineer.

A few months ago, my parents told me to cut back on my time at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it was just a “hobby.” I didn’t know how to tell them how it was so much more to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we’re getting there, though. The other day, I talked to my mom about the internships I had applied to and about a journalism class I was thinking about taking. And for the first time in my life, my mom talked to me about it like journalism was an option. For the first time in my life, my mom was accepting me as I was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be people who read this and won’t understand why it matters so much what my parents say. But despite how hard I’ve railed against a lot of the things my parents believe in, there’s a part of me that still wants to please them. I want my parents to be proud of me. I want to show them that I can both pursue the career I love and support myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And above all that, there’s the prevailing aspiration familiar to any child of an immigrant: I want to make their sacrifices worthwhile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are days when I get so angry at my parents for not understanding me and at the world for throwing me all the curveballs it can think of. And then there are days when I Whatsapp message my parents about something I’ve accomplished, and they’ll respond with a thumbs-up or “nice” (the only two ways they know how to give praise), and it means everything to me.</span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi wants people to find a balance between their parents’ aspirations and their own. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

I’m not really sure there is another campus in the world that can replicate the bubble of seclusion and charm that our one square mile of duplexes provides. However, since the day I graduated from high school, there has been a growing sense of restlessness that I can only attribute to my inner need to be doing something substantial with all the time I am allocated on this earth. While I appreciate the perks of studying in such an environment (our school is on a goddamn beach with skies that provide their own Instagram filters), I can’t help but feel my life has stagnated due to the bubble in which I.V. resides. There are only so many Sands Beach sunsets and die tossings before the shine begins to lose its luster. I may not have verbally expressed this, but as I left UCSB, part of me was hoping that I wouldn’t come back to campus.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85239\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85239\" data-attachment-id=\"85239\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=85239\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85239\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A change of pace was needed, and I jumped at the chance to move to London: a city that is much larger and much more diverse than where I had resided for the past two years. And I love it. It’s loud. There is no time to pause and take a breath. People in suits, tracksuits and puffy jackets bustle in and out of every little corner imaginable. Sarcasm oozes from many of its inhabitants. For the first time, I don’t feel like a wandering entity unable to find something worth latching onto. I feel as if I am a functioning cog in a machine much bigger than I can comprehend. It might sound contradictory with my need for importance, but I enjoy the anonymity that comes with living in a city with more than eight million people. I can write my own story without the shackles of familiarity combined with preconceived notions of myself and life itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And write my own story I have, as I have dived into things I have been too scared to dive into before, participated in things I can’t participate in back home and explored places I only dreamed of exploring. I can safely say there is no place on earth I’d rather be in this current moment. I can’t imagine anyone becoming disenchanted with this place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why on earth would you leave California for here?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The weather alone is going to leave you clinically depressed by mid-November.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s great and all, I get it, but this place is exhausting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as I had become disillusioned with the vibrant sunshine and peaceful bike rides back home, these people I encountered had experienced the same fatigue with their environment as I had, despite the vast difference in lifestyles the two settings provide.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They, too, were unsettled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I thought about it, it made sense. Despite my own beliefs in my societal integration, I am still a foreigner purposely seeking out the good in an environment I am excited to be present in. The cons of annoyances have not settled in due to the fact that it is very new to me and that “very new” is exactly what I’m seeking. What was my boredom back home was someone else’s rare chance to simmer down and calm their busy brain. I had complete access to a world they don’t usually experience, and they couldn’t process why I would leave it. Their home was to me what mine was to them. We shared the exact same feelings. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen to me if I stayed here? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grass is always greener on the other side” is an overused and cliche saying, but it rings true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this desire to grow up fast while still working out the kinks of immaturity a healthy combination? What’s to tell me these times at UCSB aren’t the “good old days” that I’ll remember fondly in 15 years? Am I moving too fast while wanting to go even faster?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on this, I couldn’t help being drawn to a particular thought. Everytime I come home to my hometown, exiting the 280 freeway, this wave of calmness and comfort washes over me. As I weave through the hills and watch the sunlight trickle through familiar trees and neighborhoods, I can’t help but think fondly back to the memories and feelings I associate with the place. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be a fleeting feeling before my desire to leave eventually takes over, but the comfort my hometown provides is always there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m only 20 years young, and I am not sure if I’m ready to fully leave that comfort behind. I’m close. But not just yet. The world is a large place, and I intend to inhabit as much of it as possible. My London experience in itself has been more than I could have ever asked for. But these places are not going anywhere; I’ve got a little bit of time. I’ve got a life back home I still need to take care of. A crisp and sudden break is not a fitting end for my first two years of college. For the first time in my life, I should attempt to actively enjoy slowing down. Maybe it’s OK to “gather my rosebuds while I may” for a little bit longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2019, I will be back in Isla Vista. There is no guarantee I won’t fall right back into the funk of a routine I had become accustomed to. But with the potential experiences and future I now know lie ahead of me, I trust myself to acknowledge the bigger picture that life has painted for me. This is one chapter of a longer story. With that in mind, I think I’ll be OK enjoying the ride and sitting back while watching that damn beautiful Sands Beach sunset for the next 18 months.

But outside, nicotine fuels an entirely different world. Just outside Davidson library, oceanside, is a small smoking area where gatherings of students rejoice quietly in the sweet relief of nicotine, sheltered by an enclave of coral trees. The smoking area is dotted with Chinese international students chain smoking, draped in all of their Gucci glory, softly chatting in Mandarin as the glow of their cigarettes burn through 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>I’m addicted to walking by the smoking area. The wafer-thin wisps of tobacco smoke are pungent with memories of my childhood. As I overhear bits and pieces of Mandarin in the overlapping conversation, I’m overwhelmed with the searing image of my uncles’ Zhonghua cigarette packs, red and gold, spinning on the Lazy Susan as they threw back another tiny thimble of sorghum liquor at dinner. “Another toast!” they’d say. “Gānbēi!”</p>\n<p>My formative years were spent in Dalian, China — a seaside city where the skies were a perpetual lovely yellow color — at a time when I didn’t know the English alphabet. It was a time when my Mandarin was fluent, I did not know Cheetos existed and my classmates and I wore little, red scarves to elementary school as a promise of our allegiance to the Party. The back of my first grade classroom was graced by a small framed image of Mao Zedong, and I spent summers learning brush calligraphy. I drank hot water, not iced; I watched soap operas about the glory of the Tang dynasty and idolized Zhang Ziyi. My grandmother even found me a ping pong coach.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

I rejected parts of my culture that weren’t so palatable to white suburbia, understanding that the price of white acceptance was to conform to their criticisms of my identity. I stopped eating chicken feet, I pretended not to hear accusations that I had an unfair advantage in math class and I internalized the colorblind racism that seemed to be the backbone of country club civilization. Privilege shielded me from certain truths about my identity in America that I could not understand until I escaped childhood.</p>\n<p>To be an East Asian-American is to bear the burden of the model minority myth in exchange for privileges of American colorism, to participate in society as quasi-white. In some ways, I even benefit from the constant fetishization of my body; I welcome the hypersexualization of the ‘Orient’ if my desirability harbors me from white hate. The constant worry that my partner likes me for the color of my skin is bearable background noise to the atrocities that other marginalized groups in America suffer at the hands of white supremacy. I live like a sheep in acceptance of my oppression because “it could be worse.”</p>\n<p>Today, my unfortunate preference for white men suggests that my assimilation to American culture is all but irreversible and complete while my faithful devotion to Confucian filial piety suggests the opposite. Was I born Chinese or was I born an American citizen? I struggled to answer this age-old question of nature or nurture, fearing that choosing one would invalidate the other. Hyphenated-American feels like a betrayal to both sides of my identity, belittling both my ethnic heritage and my right to an equal place in American society. I feel like Schrödinger’s cat, supposedly American or Chinese, simultaneously both and neither.</p>\n<p>So this summer, I made a three-month pilgrimage, a repatriation to the Motherland. It had been 10 years since I was last in China, 10 years since I last saw the people and the home I had left behind. Surely we had grown apart. When my plane landed in Beijing in the middle of blistering June, I was immediately surrounded by swarming crowds of people who looked like me. From luggage claim to customs were all black-haired, almond-eyed, yellow-skinned people. At the company I worked at, we used WeChat instead of email and Didi instead of Uber. I enthusiastically huffed in my boss’s cigarette smoke as she smoked her skinny mint menthol Esse’s. Submerged in a rich, homogenous soup of my culture at its purest, I revelled in the feeling of true belonging for the first time since my childhood. This must be what it feels like to be white in America.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Privilege shielded me from certain truths about my identity in America that I could not understand until I escaped childhood.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Chinese friends I made at work welcomed me without second thought. Many fellow interns were “sea turtles,” international students studying in England and the U.S., while others had spent their entire lives in China. They were excited to meet an American who spoke Mandarin fluently. I spent my weekends with them as they showed me everything that had changed within the last 10 years I spent away from China, everything they had grown up with that I had not. The glory of modern China defeats all expectations. The impossibly low cost of labor ensures that after dividing every RMB price by six to convert to the dollar, every luxury suddenly became accessible.</p>\n<p>I felt intense waves of guilt as I enjoyed each freedom the powerful dollar allowed, but to my nouveau-riche colleagues, this lifestyle was to be expected. The wealth disparity was welcomed. It made for fierce competition; I was told it is the reason why I seemed to love almost everything in China. Case in point, I failed to eat an unsatisfactory meal while in the Motherland. Hot pot, barbeque, homestyle cooking and street food that I had eaten in the States for the past 10 years were weak imitations of the real deal. Perhaps the most important experience of my life was waiting in a two-hour line in Chengdu and missing my bullet train so I could devour a bowl of red-oil wontons inside some grandma’s first floor apartment. Even Kentucky Fried Chicken is transformed beyond perfection in China: perfect pastel de natas, lightly battered shrimp and the flawless execution of an American-style chicken that defined succulence.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was American of me to fall so madly in love with China, to see its good and look past its faults, to enjoy its mastery of pork and to forget its human rights abuses. I slurped on noodle soup made by Uighur cooks. I chugged Tibetan yak butter tea. I participated in capitalism with vigor and consumed its unethical fruits, all while not feeling particularly homesick for the U.S. My summer, in its retellings, appears glorified and unblemished. I wonder if I was more tourist than local, more propaganda than reality.</p>\n<p>My colleagues told me that Americans stride with unreasonable confidence. Perhaps because of this ego, it’s obvious I am American. Street vendors knew to approach me in English and I was easily swindled for reasons beyond my naiveté. I did not join my female colleagues’ constant war against the sun as they opened their umbrellas in broad, dry daylight to shield UV rays. While I gladly ate every iteration of offal, I refused to take the constant dieting advice from strangers. Was it wrong to pick and choose the parts of my culture that I loved? Maybe. Perhaps then it would be fair to categorize my love for China as appropriation: Was I so foreign that I could warrant such a label? For too long, I had envisioned a perfect home without questioning if it still had room for me.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, this home had room for people who identified as expats. China’s cities are full of cop-outs for such people. Coffee shops and bars are remodeled with non-squatting toilets and full English menus to simulate American spaces. The time I spent in the Sanlitun district in Beijing is a near perfect reflection of my identity crisis as I ate hot wings with Ivy League white boys and other American-born Chinese. To the excitement of my coworkers, I could navigate both spaces with similar ease. They wanted to know if I’d date white men back home and would tell me how beautiful my babies would be if they were mixed. I think of the hell that mixed-race Asian Americans go through, their genetic expression a visual representation of the hyphenated-American experience as they face ostracization and fetishization all at once. I guess my only hope is that my children can speak to their grandma in Chinese, I tell them, knowing full-well it’s almost set in stone that in my late-twenties, I will probably marry some white boy who listens to too much indie rock.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe it was American of me to fall so madly in love with China, to see its good and look past its faults, to enjoy its mastery of pork and to forget its human rights abuses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My coworkers’ question came from a place of hope and love: For them, America is the dreamland, the prized visa, the answer to all of China’s troubles. For me, the answer is China: I continually fail to see beyond my privilege, beyond my First Amendment rights and the salvation that is my navy-blue passport. I feel nourished by the land and by the food my people had perfected over millennia. Mine is a stupid, primitive, tribal reaction akin to seeing long-lost family. I look to China and see the warm embrace of 1.4 billion people who look like me, look like my mother and my mother’s mother, people whose ancestors fought in wars with mine, who lived through dynasties with mine, and I wonder if my deep love for China is a nod of forgiveness to all of its wrongdoings. In a selfish way, I saw hope from China.</p>\n<p>I had always believed that I could claim my land and culture based on some predestined ethnic right. My dissatisfaction with the in-between space for Chinese Americans could not justify the blatant ignorance of my class privilege. To be the child of Chinese immigrants means to enjoy inherent privileges and opportunities; to afford the experience of repatriation this summer is a privilege; to go and leave as I pleased across borders and firewalls was an immeasurable exercise of power. I reaped power from the in-between space that I so resented, forgetting that my love for China was a decision, while the people of China had no alternatives. Patriotism, which I had rejected so vehemently in the U.S., was not a choice for my Chinese family and friends. I could never be qualified to call myself Chinese without living through the evils and flaws of the country I so loved. The loss of certain human rights was a sacrifice I couldn’t make: my mother made that decision for me when she immigrated to the U.S. The age-old question of nature or nurture was finally answered: I was born different.</p>\n<p>When I walk past the cigarette soirée after another fruitless night at Davidson, I breathe in deep. The tobacco smoke is Beijing smog; it is my love for China and its people, my people— it is me and my pursuit of home. While I continue to long for that home, it’s time for me to make peace with the in-between space. And when Chinese international students continue to talk to me in English during lecture while I continue to respond in Mandarin, I can remind myself of cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p><i>Katherine Chen wants her fellow Chinese Americans to eat chicken feet and text their moms back on WeChat. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

Despite the money, timing and fear of being lonely, having not known any other applicants, I figured it would all be worth it for the experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Bioma Travel was founded by UCSB Bren School alumni who personally guide and work with the students on each expedition. This direct relationship and commitment set the program apart from all other research/internship opportunities I had seen before. Their prompt communication and comprehensive accommodations greatly enhanced my experience. The trip was 10 days of volunteer work and research, plus an optional three-day “adventure.” I originally signed up for just the first portion, but was convinced to extend my stay once I realized how priceless the memories would be.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

For example, the AP Environmental Science Yosemite trip was what initially inspired me to pursue environmental science. However, the structure made me feel juvenile and restricted. Making first-hand observations and drawing conclusions that were physically and visually relatable convinced me to major in the subject; but on the other hand, taking instructions from our “leader” while sitting criss-cross applesauce took away from enjoying the landscape like real people, not children. The fake and forced classroom setting created an uncomfortable teacher-student dynamic, though the staff was in retrospect not much older than we were at the time. The rules were equally as patronizing —</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buddy-system, curfew, alphabetical arrangements, assigned groups, etc. I was apprehensive about this program being similarly condescending, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of freedom we were given.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of what we have at our fingertips here at UCSB — a whole network of cool people and unique opportunities that might just slip by if you don’t listen to the universe when it calls.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no idea what to expect as far as the kind of fieldwork we were supposed to conduct. The first couple of days were full of PowerPoints and lectures, but by the third night we set out on our first patrol. Using the word “patrol” for data collection was initially very confusing, and often confuses people when I explain the type of work we did, but we were in fact pacing the beaches on high alert. Staff members of the MINAE, a branch of the Costa Rican Ministry of Research, led two groups of us toward the north and south ends of the beach. We spent four to five hours a night searching for turtles and recording handwritten data on those that laid eggs, even in the pouring rain.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84986\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84986\" data-attachment-id=\"84986\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/turtles-and-travels-researching-abroad-in-costa-rica/bioma-2018-157/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=650%2C434&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,434\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BIOMA-2018-157\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84986 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84986\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaun Wolfe / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere and energy were like no other; 12 eager yet exhausted girls decked out in the dorkiest water-resistant, dark-colored long-wear — complete with headlamps, ponchos and water shoes — marching single-file through murky estuaries and across the black sand that so perfectly matched the utterly black landscape.

To my knowledge, Internal Vice Presidents in the past arguably have not taken as much effort as I have to physically attend these meetings and represent Associated Students to its fullest capacity on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, as the Internal Vice President I also chair the Associated Students Committee on Honoraria, where I have to process every single request for monetary compensation that is submitted by every BCU member, executive office member and entity chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being the representative for student on-campus and university affairs and chairing the Committee on Honoraria, I also serve as the presiding officer and chair of the Associated Students Senate where I manage 24 student senators and at-large student representatives to the three senate standing committees. Doing so, I maintain parliamentary procedure and create the weekly senate agendas as well as review the minutes to every board, commission and unit that operates within the Associated in order to ensure they are par with the Associated Students Legal Code. Lastly, I process 50+ weekly on a day-to-day basis solely on Associated Students, Campus and University Affairs, yet nobody other than myself and the individuals who have held my seat before are aware of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an executive officer of Associated Students, I also have the honor and privilege to work with 10 of the most amazing and driven individuals on campus in my office who are committed to enhancing the well being of students at the university level. This entails yet more meetings and task delegation including but not limited to facilitating the Fall Associated Students Kelly Pearman Executive Fellowship, holding weekly office meetings and executing officewide projects and responsibilities. All of these add to my duties of being the chair of senate, chair of Committee on Honoraria and representing student on-campus committees and boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the points stated in the editorial,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) The clause stated the public posting of Office Hours also states under it: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Executive Director or designee shall be responsible for posting office hours on the respective door, the A.S. website, posting the respective office hours next to the photo portraits of the ASUCSB elected officials that are placed in the University Center, and for sending out a university-wide email to all students with the names of all elected and appointed ASUCSB officials and their respective office hours by the end of the (3rd) third week of each quarter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I assume the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> self-nominated myself as the designee or assumed I was the Executive Director of Associated Students which I am not. Past Internal Vice Presidents have also never compiled a master list of senators’ office hours, yet I am doing so this quarter and will do so for the rest of the year as a part of my platform for transparency that I ran on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) “They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowhere in the Associated Students legal code says that a Senate bill database needs to be established, and as part of my platform for transparency, I made it upon myself to establish it this year as precedent for future Internal Vice Presidents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) “They demanded </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBL</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBL</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– had every right to record.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators during the meeting did not consent to being filmed at the time of the livestream which is completely within their right to privacy, and it was during a time where minutes were not to be recorded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4) “Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators and myself do not even have the ability to personally update the Associated Students website, so the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> assuming that we do is a complete misunderstanding of what we can do as elected officials, as bureaucratic processes still apply to these student leaders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I am also a first-generation Southeast Asian student on this campus double majoring in a BS in Biological Sciences and a BA in Asian American Studies. I take 16 units a quarter in order to graduate on time so that I can receive two degrees from the prestigious undergraduate institution which is UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like all elected officials within Associated Students, I am a student first and leader second. If we need to take time to have a mental-health break or destress from what our lives entail, then we will and that should not be ridiculed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because I take the time to acknowledge that my position is more than just being the chair of the Associated Students Senate but also a main representative of undergraduate interests at the campus and university level does not mean that others can only see my duties as controlling one aspect of the association when it is simply not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wants to judge the two posts on my twitter account and a private snapchat story then they can, but never will I let an individual, group or entity assume and say that I do not take my job seriously because I understand the privilege and work that holding an executive officer position in Associated Students, let alone being the Internal Vice President, entails.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I truly believe what you’re doing as a board is honorable, meaningful and worthwhile. I want to emphasize that my leadership is student-centered. Moving forward, I hope that Associated Students as a whole and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can work past personal conflicts in order to work together toward a better UC Santa Barbara campus by both serving and informing the student body in a manner that prioritizes the students who voted me into office and pay into running our student-led press. This can be a learning experience, just as was stated in the article, and in the future I would be more than willing to have my office work with yours in assuring accountability, transparency and ensuring that student leaders are properly recognized for their work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincerely,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven

Salud Carbajal stands up for students — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he has supported Senator Warren’s Bank on Student’s Act to allow students like me to refinance their student loan debt. He has also co-sponsored legislation for the Federal Government to partner with states to provide free community college tuition to all students for two years. He introduced legislation to increase the value of Pell </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grants, near</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ly doubling the max award to $9,650. Salud is also a strong advocate for codifying Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors on college campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos, do not be complacent. Be bold and intentional with your ballot. Say something with the bubbles you choose to fill in. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am certain that Salud Carbajal is a candidate that will represent me and the communities that I am a part of.

Sleepovers are riddled with questions like, “When will I lose my virginity?” or, “How did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lose your virginity?” These questions always plagued me, yet at the same time, they brought immense curiosity. As a queer woman, I have a lot of confusion and frustration with the word itself. Over time I’ve come to realize that virginity doesn’t even exist; by definition, it refers to the first time someone has sex, but sex can mean different things to different people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the occasions that I have found myself in a circle of friends, talking about virginity or how we lost it, more than one of the stories always seem to end with some statement like, “It went in and out like three times and then we were done.” Now, there is nothing wrong with this, and if both members felt like it was sex, then it was, because sex should be defined by the individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My issues with this only come in when queer women who have had sex with other women are considered virgins simply because they’ve never been penetrated. My girlfriend has been called a virgin by our friends because they don’t readily accept what we do as sex. So if my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.” Ultimately, sex is culturally defined by the presence of a penis, or at least some form of penetration, and this is just wrong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We often miss out on having those stories about our “first time,” because no one ever talks about what that would even look like. One of the things I heard about while I was growing up was “scissoring,” and I thought, “So, are we just supposed to smash our labia together until we both come in one simultaneous moment of bliss?” No, young Anabel, nobody does that. The next thing you might learn is that lesbians lose their virginity when they are eaten out. This sounds great, except men can eat out girls as well, so why are straight women who have only been eaten out still considered virgins?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s almost as if we’re agreeing that gay women really only get half the experience that straight women get, and as someone who has had sex with both men and women, that just doesn’t feel like the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s next? The strap-on. If you have just been fucked with a strap-on for the first time, most people would argue you have lost your virginity. But what about the person who wore it? I doubt that many people would consider that a loss of virginity for the giver. Truth be told, I don’t know how queer women lose their virginity with the cultural definition we currently hold, and that’s why the definition must change.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stated earlier that losing your virginity is defined by the first time a person has sex. This implies that in order to understand what that means, we must first decide what it means to have sex. My definition of sex is that it must be a consensual, intimate, vulnerable and, of course, sexual act. That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my straight friends, after having sex for the first time, reported that they didn’t feel any different. I myself reported the same thing after having sex with a man. This is probably because we had already had milestone-like experiences that were consensual, intimate, vulnerable and sexual that did make us feel different or changed. At least, I know this is the case for myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can pinpoint a couple times when I actually felt like I lost my virginity that don’t match the classic definition. It wasn’t the first time I had sex with a man, or the first time a girl ate me out, or even the first time I was fucked with a strap-on. I would say I lost my virginity the first time my girlfriend saw me naked and I felt my most vulnerable — but also my most beautiful. I could also say it was the first time I gave my girlfriend an orgasm, even if it was only with my hands. I could even argue that with each new partner I am losing my virginity over and over again, because I am learning to be vulnerable with someone new — just like how every kiss with a new person feels like my first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your moment is, the point is that it doesn’t matter. Sex is whatever it feels like it should be to you and your partner.
