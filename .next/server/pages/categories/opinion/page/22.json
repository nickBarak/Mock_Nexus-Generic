Dozens of news and media outlets have chosen to boycott the mascot and refer to the team as I just have — “the professional football team in D.C.” It’s because the name of the actual mascot is an outright slur that wouldn’t even be in the vocabulary of a decent person, were it not for its singular appearance in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Team owner Daniel Snyder is indifferent about the campaign, going as far as telling reporters to print the word “never” in capital letters when writing about the prospects of a name change. It’s a damning situation, but a surprisingly common one.</p>\n<p>However, some teams such as the Florida State Seminoles have gained acceptance from local First Nations people because of their particularly respectful representations. While there is obviously some problematic baggage to any representation — because a flat-out genocide was the sole catalyst for such usage — it’s good to see the people affected have a voice among FSU.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If we were to truly be critical of our time on this campus, our own mascot should be up for discussion as well. The gaucho is an equivalent of the North American cowboy. The depiction we use is a cartoon and it’s comical, but definitely not in a good-natured way. In fact, it’s quite dehumanizing. The fact that we use cultural terms like this for a cheap gimmick to make money is as off-putting and disgusting to me as it is to see a bro decked out in stereotypical drunk Mexican threads on Halloween night in I.V.</p>\n<p>So I propose that either this institution set up a cultural exchange initiative with the people of the region most commonly associated with the gaucho, which would be quite educational and potentially eye-opening for most students, or that we change the name outright.</p>\n<p>I, for one, fully support the latter measure. We have even had a history of flirting with a name change, with the Cubs being the front-runner during our transition to the UC system way back when. I would love to be a Cub; it’s catchy, cute and cuddly, with a potential mean streak. It also beats getting the usual “WTF” reaction we get when telling people what our current mascot is.</p>\n<p>If this past weekend found you asking why Columbus Day is a legitimate thing after all the terrible things he did, it’s because the people in power really just don’t care. There’s too much at stake. But why not be thinkers? Why not be empathetic? Let’s change the status quo.</p>\n<p><em>Mario Vasquez is a fourth-year history major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, my professor gave my class some personal advice. To sum it up, he told us to choose our majors and aspire towards certain careers for one reason and one reason only: a love for the subject and an interest in the profession.</p>\n<p>Later, during our weekly section, one of my classmates challenged what our professor had said, telling him upfront that it was probably the worst advice she’d ever heard. While he thought that careers should be based off of interest and natural talent, she thought it was completely irresponsible and impractical to ignore the economic concerns that vary between different career paths. With our undergraduate education costing around $30,000 a year, she argued that students could not simply wait around for the subject that “clicks” with them; students were making the right, informed choice when choosing certain majors that led to higher incomes. Money, being one of the fabrics of our society, plays an important role in the decisions we make as pre-career, undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>Yet if money were to be the only thing we based our decisions off of, why wouldn’t we all be engineering majors? Besides the fact that I would probably drop out after the first quarter, there is also the underlying yearning shared by all of us whether we like it or not: we crave passion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We hear both sides every day: “Follow your dreams,” and, “Find your passion,” versus, “This market has really good job opportunities,” and, “This career will make you a lot of money.” In high school, you may have taken a test that assigns you the professional career that fits you best. My results told me that I would excel at being a wedding planner, and while I do enjoy planning events such as parties and dances, let’s be honest: I’d much rather crash a wedding than plan one.</p>\n<p>Then my counselor told me that I should major in English because I scored well on the AP Literature test and on the writing section of the SAT. However, to me, writing essays upon essays for the next four years sounded more like selling my soul than attending college (no offense, English majors).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that in these early years of young adulthood, most students aren’t sure of what their passion is yet. We want to find it, but we just don’t know how. And the one thing we’re sure of is that money is important, because it lets you live comfortably and escape the worries of not being able to sustain the lifestyle you desire.</p>\n<p>Coming out of high school without a clear vision of what path to take or which passion to pursue, many freshmen (including myself) respond to the words “jobs,” “money” and “opportunity” with open ears. Is that bad? My professor would argue yes and my classmate would argue no. I say to hell with both of them. Yes, financial security is an important factor when making decisions about your future. Yes, happiness is also an important factor when thinking about the job you’ll be doing for the next several decades. But do these two factors have to be seen on the opposite sides of the spectrum? To say, “Yes, definitely,” would be as ridiculous as UCSB’s ranking at No. 2 instead of No. 1 on Princeton Review’s Top Party Schools (seriously, what is the deal with that?).</p>\n<p>So what’s the best answer then? There isn’t one really, or at least not one that’s the same for all of us. Although “money can’t buy happiness,” it sure as hell can put a roof over your head and a nice warm meal on the table. However, how you get that money is completely up to you. Chasing a goal solely for the end amount of cash isn’t the best strategy in the book. No matter who you are or what you’re after, you’re going to want have fun while you chase whatever it is you decide to pursue. Sure, an engineering major might statistically be better off than a psychology major, but the world we live in wasn’t built by statisticians. And we wouldn’t be college students in the first place unless we adhered to the motto “#YOLO.”</p>\n<p>As young adults, the only way we’re sure to avoid the constant, pressing advice of those around us is by locking ourselves in our rooms and shutting off all human contact, something I’d strongly advise you against doing. The thing is, it’s a natural tendency for those older than us to warn us about the future based of their own experiences or observations. But it’s our job to decide which advice we’re going to listen to and which advice we’re going to throw into the lagoon. Most importantly, take to heart the advice that is going to further your own interests and passions. After all, today’s top scientists say that the only reason our lagoon smells so bad is from all of that rotten advice.</p>\n<p><em>Travis Zane is a first-year economics/accounting major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

As a result of the healthcare crisis in America, the I.V. clinic merged with two Santa Barbara-based clinics to form Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics, Inc. After a few years, the building was sold to keep SBNC afloat and Isla Vista’s community center was lost. At the time, this didn’t seem so disastrous because the County Redevelopment Agency planned to build a community center in I.V. However, because of the State’s fiscal crisis, all RDAs were dissolved before construction started out on Estero Road.</p>\n<p>Before its dissolution, the RDA purchased the clinic and church buildings intending to bulldoze them and build an immense underground parking lot. Needing 2/3rds-support of Park District voters, Measure D, which would have granted IVRPD the right to sell, lease or trade town parks, was instead defeated 3-1 in 2008. The County is left with the option of keeping the buildings “for government use” or selling them, perhaps to private developers.</p>\n<p>To their credit, the County board of supervisors supports keeping the two buildings but over the next year, the Park Board will be deciding just how much the District will be involved in the future of these properties.</p>\n<p>The Board has already stated the buildings should be the town’s much needed community center. But how is its staffing and maintenance to be paid for? And what if the State Finance Department insists the buildings should be sold? How will the Park Board prevent them from being demolished to make way for another high-rise apartment complex (with little or no parking)?</p>\n<p>Well, the reason I’m writing to the Daily Nexus is because there is a one-year term open on the Park Board, to which any I.V. resident registered to vote is eligible to be appointed. The newest member of the Park Board would have the opportunity to step into this historic brew of events and possibly have a sizable effect on Isla Vista’s future. This open position will be filled by vote of the other four board members at their public meeting, Nov. 14. The term expires at the next regular election, in November 2014.</p>\n<p>As it happens, the next Park Board meeting is showing The Isla Vista Slide Show, a sweeping history of the town emphasizing the 1970 civil disturbances and the community-building movement that rose phoenix-like out of those ashes. This double-barreled presentation inspired several generations of UCSB students to get involved in their community. It may literally change your life.</p>\n<p>If you’re tempted by the chance to gain some hands-on experience seeing how a community runs, check out more information about the Park District and the application form available at www.ivparks.org. The deadline for applications is 5 p.m., Nov. 8 at the IVRPD office, 961 Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>The meeting starts at 6 p.m., Thursday, Oct. 24 in the IVRPD offices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Carmen Lodise was on the Isla Vista Park Board 1976-80 and participated in buying the town’s first million-dollar-bundle of parklands.

According to our oh-so-omnipresent source of Wikipedia, it represents a form of foreplay that involves two or more people who act out roles in a sexual fantasy. While that explanation more or less adequately portrays the technicality of the act, let’s thrust deeper. My definition of sexual role-play? It’s freedom. Pure, steaming and explosive freedom.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, non role-players question the allure of the act. Why pretend to be someone else when you have a perfectly capable self to be? Why not leave the dress-up and acting for Halloween? This, my friends, is where the freedom comes in. Sexual role-play builds for an almost excruciatingly erotic scene that allows you to overcome many of your sexual inhibitions, at any time and at any place. It grants you permission to access your deepest desires, your innermost fantasies and your most desperate wishes. Want to be tied up and dominated? Have your partner rip your clothes, strip you, bind you, whip you, whisper dirty diction as you grow more and more aroused — any or all of the above to quench that temporary bondage binge. Want to reenact the classic scandal between teacher and pupil? Find a spare room, set up a desk and whiteboard, decide on who teaches and who learns; dress the part and start off like it’s a one-on-one detention session or a last-minute lesson on linear algebra. Then there’s the prisoner and prison guard, the Sleeping Beauty, the dutiful robot, the repairman and the naughty wife, the photographer and the model, the celebrity and a lucky fan … Possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>On top of that, role-play possesses no confinement to physical, in-person play. It can occur via phone, email or an online chat room. It also holds no prejudice against two partners or five as well as a private setting or an open show for suspecting — and unsuspecting — audiences. This is your sexual fantasy put to life, so live it like you want to, folks.</p>\n<p>For the expert role-players, I tip my hat to you and cheer you on. But for the newer actors and actresses just starting out or are contemplating dipping their feet in the fun, here are some tips:</p>\n<p>1. Immerse yourself. Absorbing the essence of your character and your scenario will provide for a more realistic scene. As for generic, easier stories, you can get by from watching some films or using your imagination to hurl out that cowboy drawl or pretend you know anything about teaching. But for some of you ambitious role-playa-playas, be sure to do your research. My boyfriend and I once played out a hypnotist scene, and while it was still hot and heated, I realized midway that I wasn’t fully sure of routines or phrases hypnotists use on their clients, and role-play verbiage became a bit stilted. Of course, it’s important to note that everything depends on your seriousness for the play and your demands on realism. If you’re just messing around and having fun, laughing between scenes and guffawing about the awkwardness is a-okay. But if you want that penetrating experience, get down to business and get into it.</p>\n<p>2. Obtain appropriate props, set a good scene. Again, this depends on how serious you are about the role-play. Some people rent or buy equipment, secure a desired location setting and obtain the appropriate costumes; others work with what they have and simply use a single item to sustain their scene. It doesn’t matter, because you don’t need to go all out in order to feel the sexual steam of role-play. However, props certainly do help accentuate the reality of the scenario and the roles, and visual affirmation acts as a stimulant not only for your eyes but also for your libido.</p>\n<p>3. Just have fun. Ultimately, this isn’t about practicing for an acting audition or memorizing a study guide. We’re just here to unlock our fantasies, and hell, if we’re going to give them life, then we might as well live them up.</p>\n<p>In the end, let’s just say the doctor from the aforementioned scene quenched his desire for release, and the patient calmed her “itch.” And what was left at the end? Two nude college students, laughing on their dorm bed about an amazing night’s play.</p>\n<p>Role-play on, Humpers, and role-play hard.</p>\n<p><em>R.

My professor had been speaking for 15 minutes but I hadn’t been listening at all. I was going through the motions of a responsible student, with my notes open, eyes attentive and head nodding, but none of her words reached my ears. Instead, I was consumed by a question that had been plaguing my thoughts and nagging at the very essence of my being for months: Why does Snoop Dogg (excuse me, Snoop Lion? Does anyone even know anymore?) love socks so much?</p>\n<p>It all started when I first followed Snoop on Instagram. Yes, that’s how familiar we are: I just call him “Snoop” now (#firstnamebasis). Snoop’s Instagram features awkwardly angled “selfies,” blunts, socks, Adidas gear and pictures of his kids. Let me describe a few of my favorite Instas:</p>\n<p>• A pair of slippers custom-embroidered with the words “Snoop Dogg,” a gold chain, G Pen vaporizer and a $2 bill, with the caption, “Essentials #slippergame #gpen.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>• One skinny foot sporting an orange, grey and black argyle sock, captioned, “Sock game!!

I’m happy fuck it long as the ice cream bomb n the kids like it I love it. Get ya hustle on!!! [sic]” (He’s really just an all-around family guy.)</p>\n<p>Within a week, I began sending out mass texts with daily updates on Snoop. At first my friends and family responded with similar enthusiasm, but one by one, they became disinterested as I continued to shove pictures of Snoop’s socks in their faces. At this point, I was just beginning to use the phrases, “Sock game!” and, “What it do, nephew?” in daily conversation.</p>\n<p>As I got deeper, I spent more and more time thinking about Snoop. How does he stay so cool? Why does a grown man smoke so much weed? Why hasn’t his daughter taught him how to take a better “selfie”? Why does he wear so much jewelry when he goes on vacations? Where can I get myself some Snoop slippers? And what is up with all the socks? Then, I started thinking I saw Snoop in airport terminals and bus stations. Is that man in the orange shirt actually just Snoop re-living his Extravaganza experience?</p>\n<p>I downloaded the Snoopify app (highly recommended) in order to better understand the Snoop mentality, but when I took my own “selfie” and tried to Snoopify it, there was nothing I could add to make it more Snoop-y. The Snoop-session had gone too far.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista and scholars of UC Santa Barbara, I am asking you to come to my aid. These unanswered questions have my mind spiraling out of control. This ardent love of Snoop Dogg has taken its toll. (See? I’m even writing in rap form now.) I only hope that if my questions are answered, I may finally be able to focus on my studies and continue a relatively normal life as a student and a friend. So seriously, guys, da fuck is up with all the socks?</p>\n<p><em>Risa Weber is a third-year communications major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

thing I remember from my Intro to Psychopathology course (and well, let’s be honest, there’s probably <i>only </i>one thing), it’s a brief discussion that I had with the instructor toward the end of our first lecture. I simply asked him, “Does anyone in the field have an issue with use of the word ‘disorder’? Presumably, every mental ‘disorder’ <i>does </i>have an inherent order and any ‘<i>dis</i>-order’ simply exists as a condition whose order is simply not as obvious to an outside observer.” My innocent inquiry was met with the following dismissive, unsatisfactory reply: “The word ‘disorder’ is just a placeholder, and everyone in the field knows that, so there’s certainly no issue.”</p>\n<p>Whoa, now — <i>au contraire, O wise professeur</i>!

It’s not exactly a fun thing to do in and of itself (not for me, anyway). So why do I care so much about this term? Well, this particular case definitely reeked something fierce of a moral issue, but more importantly, it reflected the unfortunate tendency of even our most esteemed academics to throw around words that can actually do a great deal of harm<i> </i>to our understanding of the concepts they intend to define.</p>\n<p>Here’s a more well-known example of what I mean: We often hear the word “gay” thrown about by particularly ignorant/weak-minded folk, who use the word as if it were synonymous with “bad,” “undesirable” or “uncool.” For example: “Dude, that shirt is <i>so </i>gay.” Now, the common (albeit, poor) argument from these people when trying to justify their application of the term is that everyone who takes issue is either a) overreacting or b) misunderstanding their intentionally light use of the word. After all, these “well-meaning” fools might argue, “What better way to make a term meaningless and less negatively charged than to bring it into the realm of casual, everyday use?” When I think what you guys mean is, “What better way to strip a word of its <i>malicious </i>meaning by intentionally using it <i>wrongly, </i>perhaps even <i>mockingly</i>?”</p>\n<p>Nope, I’m not having it, your argument is invalid, “warning, warning, bad argument alert!”<i> </i>etc. The more a passive listener hears the word “gay” misapplied in these contexts, the more they’re going to subconsciously begin to associate it with its wrong use. Overuse and misapplication of the term really serve to change<i> </i>our conception of it such that it eventually comes to mean something entirely different. So when these lame wads bandy about with their lighthearted misuse of “gay” as if they’re on some sort of noble, god-sent mission to bring the word down from its socio-politically charged pedestal, what they’re <i>really </i>doing is altering the less aware passerby’s implicit understanding of the word. To the passerby, “gay” becomes “bad” or “undesirable,” rather than “naturally-occurring,” “morally valid” and so on.</p>\n<p>And while the misusers of the term hold the lion’s share of blame to begin with, the passive listeners in question here — the ones who “innocently” perpetuate the redefining of the word — must accept their share as well for being so oblivious to their surroundings. But I won’t go further into blame/responsibility and social unawareness for this article’s purposes.</p>\n<p>Bringing it all back to the arena of mental “disorders,” when this instructor tried to imply that I was being unnecessarily nitpicky about a term, I instead deduced the following — that he was grossly underestimating the social weight of a word, and that he really doesn’t appreciate how astray we can be led by applying inappropriate labels to naturally occurring psychological phenomena. “Gay” and<i> </i>“disorder” are frequently misused for the same underlying reason: Because instead of putting in a conscious effort to <i>understand </i>homosexuality or mental illnesses, we take them both to denote people or psychological conditions that are somehow <i>problems in themselves</i>. That is, “gay” equates to a host of poorly conceived sociopolitical beliefs and attitudes, and “disorder” equates to taking a member of society’s atypical psychology as having no inherent or valid “order” to speak of … when, by the way, there is indeed an order to everything in this universe, whether we choose to understand or ignore it.</p>\n<p>Instead of taking the time to understand the order<i> </i>of these naturally occurring and <i>valid</i> psychological conditions, we’d rather consider them inherent<i> </i>flaws<i>, </i>writing them off as unimportant enigmas to be dealt with some other day by someone else. And by going as far as to call the word “disorder” a “placeholder,” this professor proves my point: The misuse of these words is used as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for understanding our fellow human beings <i>now</i> so as to lazily put the task off until later, thus proving that the real disorder here lies in our failure to understand each mental atypicality — not<i> </i>in the atypicalities themselves.</p>\n<p><em>     Suraj Sood is a fourth-year psychology and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Recently, I’ve been hearing more and more about “labiaplasty,” which is essentially plastic surgery on the vagina. If you’re feeling horrified right about now, we’re probably on the same page here. Now, I understand the importance of surgeries like this for people who are for example, intersex, but I want to focus here on those who are going under the knife for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>\n<p>Being insecure about your vagina is not uncommon — I’m pretty sure we’ve all at some point in the transformation of our lady gardens wondered, “Is this normal?” — and I want to start off by telling you that it probably is normal, but if you’re still worried about it, go to the doctor and ASK! Don’t let this shit interfere with your sex life because you have to be comfortable with yourself in order to enjoy yourself!</p>\n<p>Easier said than done, right? It might seem to you that every vagina you’ve ever seen looks way more normal than yours does. Or perhaps someone once told you that your vagina looks odd? Let’s just think about that for a second: I mean, what is the authority that’s setting the precedent for what a “normal” vagina looks like? If your answer is “porn,” then you can give yourself a smack in the face because I don’t know how many times this needs to be reiterated: PORN IS FICTION. All of those vaginas have been primped, primed and filmed from certain angles in order to fit in with the aesthetic idea of “The Vagina” that our culture seems to have espoused.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First of all, let’s address the fucked-up-ness of having a completely hairless vagina with tiny pink labia that barely protrudes at all as our aesthetic ideal. What you’re striving for if you’re thinking that’s what your vagina should look like is to basically return to having unaroused and prepubescent genitals. Does that sound sexy?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a quick Wikipedia search for “labiaplasty” will tell you that the average length for the labia majora (the outside lips) can be between seven and 12 cm and for the labia minora (the inside ones) is between 20 and 100 mm. And those are only two parts of the whole. So basically, what constitutes a “normal” vagina is anything that falls within a huge spectrum, across a huge amount of variables, including color and shape. So that’s why I told you that your vagina, whatever it looks like, is probably normal. And yeah, because the vagina is such a complex thing, it usually looks like kind of a mess. But it’s still normal.</p>\n<p>So I suggest you all go and Google Image “labia” — as opposed to “pussy” or other less scientific terms — to get a real idea of what vaginas look like. Oh yeah, and relax, it’s just a vagina.</p>\n<p><em>Naomi Rea is a third-year English literature and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

But after my first time, I realized that sex was great. It was the key to my maturity — it was liberating! And not just intercourse itself; all aspects of human sexuality fascinated me, from courtship to first kisses to all that sexy, dirty nastiness that follows. I mean, if Helen of Troy could bring down an entire empire because some guy wanted to bang her, the sex must have been worth it.</p>\n<p>I mean, if you think about it, what is every living being’s ultimate goal? Survival. And what is survival if you cannot pass on your quality traits to the next generation? Whether you like it or not, you have been hardwired to reproduce, and therefore 99% of us humans are sexually charged (excluding the Shakers and those who identify as asexual, of course).</p>\n<p>Whether you’re waiting for marriage or have already lost count of your I.V. flings, you have to understand that we all have urges. Think about your relationship with food: When you’re hungry, you eat. And when you deny yourself food, that urge to eat doesn’t just go away — it actually worsens over time. Horniness is strikingly similar to hunger. It is a completely natural human drive, one that has kept our species alive for thousands and thousands of years. If we hadn’t explored this primal instinct from the very beginning, our kind would have wasted away, starving for the nourishment we could only give to each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Obviously we don’t need to repopulate the Earth anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean these urges have faded away. Plain and simple, sex feels good, and so does eating. The brain releases pleasure signals when you feed and when you fornicate — think of the evolutionary “Four Fs”: fighting, fleeing, feeding and fucking, all controlled by our friend, the hypothalamus. So why deny yourself of two of the greatest feelings in the world?</p>\n<p>Of course, there is always the problem of overindulgence. What happens when you overeat? You develop a wide variety of problems, your ass included. We all know obesity is one of the most pressing health issues in America, along with Type II Diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Sex can have a hefty price tag as well. Unplanned pregnancy, STIs and the emotional trauma that can arise from risky behavior are just some of the reasons why so many preach abstinence.</p>\n<p>But my tried-and-true motto? Everything in moderation. Find a balance. If you can physically and emotionally handle a hookup every night of the week, go for it! If you want to slow things down with a committed relationship, that’s cool too! Fine with taking things in your own hands for a while? Dandy! I, myself, at 4’9” and a hundred pounds, cannot eat five heavy meals a day, but I still have my favorite, go-to recipes. And of course, a light snack every once in a while certainly curbs the urge.</p>\n<p><em>Echo Meyers is a first-year pre-biology major.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We began talking about the dating culture at each of our relative schools. He was looking for advice on how he was going to ask out a girl with whom he had been hooking up for three weeks. He wanted her for himself. He said he was going to take her out to a really nice, elaborate dinner. Then he asked, “Do you think I should ask her to be my girlfriend before, during or after the dinner?” I respond, “During.” But hell, what do I know? It’s not like I’ve ever been taken on a candlelit dinner throughout my three years in college. And neither have any of my five normal roommates.</p>\n<p>Here’s a story for you: It’s about a Boy with blue eyes and a Girl with brown hair. Boy and Girl had been friends for a while. One evening, Girl was hosting a party and Boy arrived. That evening, their friendship surpassed just friendship. Whenever you have sex with a friend for the first time, you move into precarious territory. Anyway, Boy needed to use the restroom in the middle of everything and upon return, decided to use the same condom as before. This was a flagrant turn-off for Girl, so she suggested that they both go to sleep. Three hours later, Girl awakened, turned to her side and noticed that Boy had enigmatically disappeared. “I just wanted to sleep in a bigger bed,” Boy texted her when she inquired where he had gone. Girl knew something was up, because Boy had slept over in her small bed many times before. Morning arrived, night arrived and the following day and week arrived … still no word from Boy.</p>\n<p>This story is just one of many that attest to the presence of letdowns, absences and avoidances that are oftentimes more hurtful than directness, all of which have been felt by a majority of females living in our community. So here’s my advice to you, boys: Try taking her out to dinner before unbuttoning her pants. Try holding her hand before asking for a blowjob.</p>\n<p>Here’s another way to put it: Guys, think of your sister. And if you don’t have a sister, imagine that you do. Would you want some guy treating her the same way you treat the girl you’re kissing?</p>\n<p>Don’t be so afraid that we’re going to shepherd you toward commitment. Our only want is for someone to treat us decently, to stay for the entirety of night when we make the request, to show facets of honesty and to walk us home when it’s dark outside and we were recently informed of a stabbing that took place on the 66 block of DP.

This hasn’t happened in 17 years. We all attend a public university, and we all are of legal voting age, so yeah, I would say it is pretty damn important that you all know how/why this is happening and just how unnecessary it is. Before I begin, let me just clarify a few things. Yes, I am a Democrat, (for those of you who are still reading, thank you). Yes, I have “Barack/Biden 2008,” “Women for Obama 2012,” “Jews love Obama,” and my personal favorite: “I’m Ready For Hillary” stickers plastered on both my laptop and guitar case. Yes, I am a political science major and therefore think that it is only common sense that every 18-22 year old undergraduate college student should be at least minimally up to date on the political goings on of our country. But, more importantly, I am an American, and the actions of our political leaders right now are laugh-worthy.</p>\n<p>To those of you who don’t believe that healthcare is a universal right, I respect your opinion. I will never in my life understand that thought process, but I will respect it nonetheless. And to those who believe that insurance companies scam hardworking families and abandon those who are suffering, I am with you, but that is beside the point… The moral of the story is that members of the Republican Party are throwing a tantrum equivalent to those of the 5-year old boy I nanny, Benjamin. When we were playing Chutes and Ladders, one night, I told Benjamin that he actually rolled only a two, not a five, and could therefore not climb the ladder to the finish line. He proceeded to kick the board over, throw the dice in my face, and lock himself in his room. These actions, of course, earned him a scolding. The concerning part is that these same actions are, right now, earning the House Republicans their paychecks…</p>\n<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or what my buddy “Almost President Mitt” lovingly coined “Obamacare”), is a 100 percent Supreme Court certified constitutional bill that was signed into effect by President Obama on March 23, 2010. I am not debating any of the details of the Act as I only have about 127 characters left, not 185,271,198. But the bill was passed. And just as Jon Stewart reminded us on “The Daily Show” with the Schoolhouse Rock clip, “I’m Just a Bill,” once a bill is introduced, voted on by both the House and the Senate, and then signed by the President of the United States, it is law. There are no “if”s, “and”s or “but”s about it — read The Constitution. Yet the Republicans have tried over 37 times in the past three years to repeal the bill and have now vowed to lock themselves in their bedrooms (continuing to be paid while doing so) until the Democrats come over, knock on the door quietly, and say “I’m sorry, you actually did roll a five. You won the game of Chutes and Ladders!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I am not trying to say that there is one group of people to blame for our country’s situation. We definitely did not get to this point sporadically. But the facts remain that Republican Congressmen/women refuse to approve our national spending budget until the enactment of ACA is delayed a year. This collective action has left more than 800,000 federal workers furloughed, closed all of our national parks and monuments, and most importantly makes it impossible for me to live stream Mei Xiang, one of the pandas at the National Zoo, and watch her sit nearly motionless while she eats her breakfast bamboo (okay the last one was not serious, but to some it may be!).</p>\n<p>Write to your representatives and senators and encourage them to stop taking pay while they hide behind their weak political tactics and allow their citizens to suffer (this applies to those of all political affiliation). Let them know that you, a young college student, think that their actions are embarrassing and immature. And, on Nov. 4, 2014 get out and VOTE. Our Congress has a 10 percent approval rating, so yeah, it’s fair to say “they suck.” But guess who elected them? This is when you feel guilty about your political participation or lack thereof. In our last congressional election, 90 percent of the incumbents who ran were reelected. So before you run your mouth about how stupid Congress is, or even worse, how none of this is relevant to you, learn about how we got to where we are and do something to help us all figure out how we can move past it together, as a country — not as two parties crammed onto one piece of land. Just to bring it home, 7.5 million American children are living without any form of health insurance. Does that leave a good taste in your mouth?</p>\n<p><em>Mckinley Krongaus is a third-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

At UCSB, everyone can find their niche. Now, I don’t want to overwhelm anyone any more than the RHA’s 30-plus Welcome Week events already have. Between the blue and yellow posters engulfing the walls of your Res Hall’s lobby, the chaos of the dinning commons and what feels like hundreds of people handing out fliers at the Arbor, it’s easy to get intimidated.  But don’t let the hype scare you away.</p>\n<p>In high school, we all had our “thing,” whether it was ASB, volleyball, water polo, band, choir … the list goes on and on. If you found something you were passionate about in high school, you can certainly continue to participate in it here. Or maybe you were that over-committed, over-involved student who just wants the chance to finally take a load off. That was me last year; I was like, “Okay, I’m in college, I can do whatever I want now, I don’t have to do any clubs, I don’t have to play a sport, I’m just gonna chill.” But while that was fun for a while, I have to say my UCSB experience was highly enhanced the quarter that I started taking advantage of more of the exciting opportunities that we have on campus.</p>\n<p>Get involved in your hall because it’s one of the best ways to meet people. If you’re on the fence about whether you want to help out or not, just go to the info sessions! Whether you’re in one of the shorties, like Anacapa or Santa Cruz, or over in San Cat, being involved in things like Hall Council will introduce you to a variety of people in your building. Even if Hall Council doesn’t sound like your thing, you should definitely check out some of the programs your peers will put on throughout the year. Inside scoop: There’s always free food at those events!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So maybe you never played basketball in high school; that doesn’t mean you can’t play on an intramural team with your friends! Intramurals give you a fun atmosphere where you can let out that competitive streak that all Gauchos naturally possess … plus, who knows how to celebrate a win better than a Gaucho? There’s also a whole array of club sports that offer everyone a fairly even playing field (no pun intended), such as rowing, rugby or lacrosse, which maybe aren’t the standard fare that was offered at your high school, but should certainly be given a shot.</p>\n<p>As you walk through the Arbor or past the UCen this week, there will be clubs, groups and teams tabling that you’ll see and think, “Hmm, sounds pretty cool.” Do not ignore this thought! Stop and chat, find out when they meet and give it a shot. You never know when and where you might discover your hidden talent, or meet your future best friend, mentor, boss, study buddy, significant other … the options are unlimited.

Torrella points towards UCSB's \"meatless mondays\" campaign in the dining common...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The movement toward more plant-based meals is taking root on college campuses across the country, with more than 200 universities, including the University of California, Santa Barbara, leading the charge with “Meatless Monday” campaigns in their dining halls.</p>\n<p>There has never been a more exciting time to expand our dining horizons. Skipping meat one day a week is not a sacrifice but an adventure. And this is reflected in the choices students are making. According to a study conducted by Technomic, over 20 percent of college students are reducing their meat consumption and for good reasons.</p>\n<p>One of those reasons is concern for the nine billion chickens, pigs and other animals raised for food each year, most of whom suffer in factory farms. For example, mother pigs in the pork industry are typically confined in tiny crates barely larger than their own bodies for virtually their entire lives. Unable to even turn around, these sensitive, intelligent animals — all of whom have their own personalities and preferences — experience tremendous physical and psychological pain. Most egg-laying hens suffer a similar fate, as they’re crammed into tiny cages with each bird granted less space than the screen of an iPad on which to live for her entire life. By choosing meat-free options just one day a week, we can all help prevent an enormous amount of cruelty to animals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Human health and the health of the planet also benefit. A report issued by the Environmental Working Group simply states, “Producing all this meat and dairy requires large amounts of pesticides, chemical fertilizer, fuel, feed and water. It also generates greenhouse gases and large amounts of toxic manure and wastewater that pollute groundwater, rivers, streams and ultimately, the ocean.”</p>\n<p>Our current rate of meat consumption is simply unsustainable. Increasing numbers of family farmers are also voicing their support for Meatless Monday as a means to achieve a more sustainable, community-based agricultural system before it’s too late. By reducing the total number of animals raised for food and looking to local farms for our livestock and produce, we will place greater value on humane, sustainable agriculture in which animal welfare is a priority.</p>\n<p><em>Kenny Torrella is the food policy coordinator for the Humane Society of the United States.

No one in their right mind would intentionally champion something as unholy as genetically modified organisms … except for <em>this</em> guy.</p>\n<p>Now, to be clear, I am not defending business practices (or any practices, for that matter) that harm the environment. In fact, I consider myself a bit of an environmentalist; I actively take steps to reduce the amount of water, energy and other resources I use, therefore cutting down amount of waste I produce. But what if I were to tell you that GMOs aren’t actually as bad for the environment and your body as you have been led to believe? And that, in the end, these unnatural plants are possibly the very thing that could lead to our continued survival as a species on this planet?</p>\n<p>First, let’s back up … way up. The fact is, we have been changing the food that we eat for the past 10,000 years. Since the first hunter-gatherers decided to settle down and start growing their own plants and raising their own animals to eat, we have been, both intentionally and accidently, changing the genetic structure of these organisms. It takes a long time, but after a few generations of breeding, these changes become clear.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There are dozens of examples of this: Wild bananas are small, green and full of seeds, but through thousands of years of domestication, we have turned these bananas into something never before found in nature. The bananas you buy at the store are, in fact, “man-made.” Yellow, delicious and perfect for human consumption, meticulous centuries of experimentation with different techniques and species of plants have turned this originally unappetizing fruit into something much more appetizing. GMOs are simply more efficient because they reduce the time it takes to craft the perfect food from hundreds of years into just a few. Instead of going through countless of stages of trial and error, genetic modification allows us to directly create the thing that we want. The only reason people don’t like it is because it is all done in a laboratory setting … it seems unnatural.<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1594820196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52018\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52021\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-19/modifying-the-stigma-surrounding-gmos/gmo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gmo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-52021\" alt=\"gmo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gmo.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>But “natural” does not inherently mean better. Hemlock is found in nature, but you sure as hell don’t want to eat it. I was born “naturally” shortsighted. Every morning that I put my contact lenses in my eyes, I am doing something “unnatural.” Is that bad? Okay, you might say that is different, as I am not really ingesting my contacts. But we ingest unnatural things all the time, namely, of course, modern medicines. Obviously Pepto-Bismol is not completely made up of ingredients that grow on trees, but when you’re having agonizing diarrhea, I don’t really think you’re going to care about how “natural” the stuff is.</p>\n<p>Of course, just like any of our modern medicines, I believe that GMOs should be stringently tested, labeled and held to very high standards. We need to be sure the food and drinks we consume, both genetically modified and otherwise, are safe and healthy and are not going to have deleterious effects on our bodies several years down the road. After undergoing the proper tests, if something is shown to be okay to consume, then I have absolutely no problem eating it.</p>\n<p>So what can GMOs offer us? Well, once you begin to change the DNA of an organism, the options become nearly limitless. We can craft heartier plants that can be cultivated in climates that they originally could not grow in, be it hot, dry deserts or frozen tundra wastelands. We could make crops that use less water and nutrients from the soil, leading to a less severe impact on the environment. We could create a plant that has twice the amount of vitamins and minerals as whatever would be found in nature, helping fight malnutrition around the globe. As the human population continues to increase exponentially in the 21st century, these are all factors that we are going to have to seriously consider. If we write off genetic modification, we will undoubtedly come to face resource depletion, a certain death for the only planet we call “home.”</p>\n<p>In the end, if you still do not like the idea of GMOs, then don’t eat them. I fully encourage being skeptical and cautious, especially with something as relatively new as the genetic modification of plants in a lab. However, if studies show that something does not have a harmful effect on one’s health, then what would be the reason for fighting it? Other than the initial gut reaction, it should become clear that, as long as they are made responsibly, the benefits of GMOs vastly outweigh any negatives.</p>\n<p><em>Jay Grafft knows that no one lives forever, but he figures that with advances in modern science, it’s not crazy to think he could live to be 245, maybe 300.</em></p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, September 19, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

So do I find it surprising that we’re again on the <i>Princeton</i><i> Review’s</i> “Top Party Schools” list? Absolutely not. We should be!

Definitely! However, there is a misconception that surrounds the word “party.” We here at UCSB party in many different ways. “Partying” does not always consist of keg stands and burning couches. Partying can mean a few celebratory dance steps after acing an exam, or a toast with friends over a glass of freshly squeezed carrot juice from the Isla Vista Co-op (a foundation in I.V. for 50 years and counting). At UCSB, partying is synonymous with enjoying a cupcake at Crushcakes, soaking up some rays at Campus Point with friends and sipping coffee out of a biodegradable cup on campus. Instead of naming us the “Number 2 Party School” you should’ve named us the “Party to” school.</p>\n<p>We are party to having five professors with Nobel prizes teaching and inspiring students on our campus. We are party to being one of the top 10 “coolest schools” in the nation, as ranked by <i>Sierra Magazine</i> (2013) for our efforts to make our campus environmentally friendly including the fact that “50 percent of food served is local.” We are party to being a public university that can boast about the fact that 46.8 percent of our classes house 20 students (U.S. News, 2013). We are party to having an “average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, [of] 91.2 percent” (U.S. News, 2013). We are party to attending a university that provides 58.3 percent of its undergraduates with “need-based financial aid” (U.S. News, 2013). We are party to attending the 35th best university in the world (Times Higher Education, 2012) out of 200 universities examined.</p>\n<p>I love our school, and I love being party to a forward-thinking and environmentally conscious community that encourages and inspires students to contribute not only through academics, but through our extracurricular activities as well. So do we party? Hell yes, we do. We party because we are an institution full of high-achievers and there’s always something to celebrate about at UCSB.</p>\n<p><i>Charlotte A.
