Affirmative action was first introduced by JFK as a way to get minorities more involved in certain industries and fields; this then evolved into a system of racial quotas in the college admission system. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/how-lewis-powell-changed-affirmative-action/572938/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1978, UC Davis Medical School was sued</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by a young white applicant Allan Bakke when he was informally told that he was rejected due to minority quotas they had to fulfill. The case made it to the Supreme Court, and he was eventually admitted but not without </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ruling that although </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/how-lewis-powell-changed-affirmative-action/572938/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quotas were unconstitutional</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, affirmative action was constitutional</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under some circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, this same issue has come up with Harvard, but with Asian-American applicants as the plaintiff. Harvard evaluates applicants categorically, rating them in areas like athletics, academics and extracurriculars. Now facing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lawsuit for systematically rejecting Asian applicants,</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Harvard admissions was found to be consistently marking Asian applicants down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the personality category when other areas had high marks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, standing on the beach, listening to the gentle, informed, politically correct voices of these hosts casually attribute Asians to “pawns” was surreal. The possibility of young Asian-Americans feeling genuinely opposed to systematic discrimination against them by a reputable institution like Harvard was so unfathomable, that instead, mental calculus had to be done to come to the more appropriate conclusion. Whites are the real people opposing this issue, and Asians are the “pawns,” removing that pesky outlier that is our demographic, and reconciling minority-friendly social liberalism with the support of affirmative action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pawns” may be the more comfortable description, because it’s an absurd thought isn’t it? A politically involved Asian-American. The concept of the Asian is not one who is engaged, active or powerful. We’re mice. We’re “guai.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps sitting in the adornments of the default, at a clinical distance, it becomes easy to gesture vaguely toward other pigments and say “minorities.” This may make it feel rational to hold all pigments to the standard — the best tool in a person’s arsenal if they’re trying to throw a wrench into the idea that groups like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans carry any sort of inherent disadvantage with them.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a secret weapon, my voiceless pigment is invoked as an example — the attractive numbers, test scores, median income, divorce rate, the immaculate success that refutes the necessity of any person of color to file a complaint.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a secret weapon, my voiceless pigment is invoked as an example — the attractive numbers, test scores, median income, divorce rate, the immaculate success that refutes the necessity of any person of color to file a complaint. The monetary figures that become a red herring in discussions about white privilege; if white people are privileged, then why do Asians make more?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things said about Asian-Americans in the media come from anyone but. And part of me feels like we brought it upon ourselves, by being okay with the stereotyping, it is mostly positive after all — what’s to complain about?  We’re doing relatively well in the U.S., so why get into the messiness of politics? We may even take pride in how little we complain, how little we speak up. Maybe that’s why our voter turnout rate is </span><a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/low-voter-turnout-among-asian-americans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47 percent versus 66 percent from blacks and 64 percent from whites.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the same time, there is a chicken-egg situation: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only</span><a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/low-voter-turnout-among-asian-americans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 31 percent of Asian-Americans </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can report being contacted by candidates versus the 53 percent average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stereotypes aren’t evil, they’re the unfortunate products of pattern recognition. It feels logical to paint a mental picture of a white man carrying a yellow face when you hear that Ed Blum is suing on behalf of Asians. Perhaps, sitting in an admissions office, looking at so many qualified Asian applicants, it may feel necessary, even rational, to justify rejection with the prejudice that Asians have no personality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going about student life here at UCSB, I’m shocked to see so many Asian students who aren’t aware of what’s happening to their own community. So many motivated, intelligent and creative individuals who have not had any discussions of the trade-offs present in policies that consider race, or lack of representation in media or never knew the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act or Japanese internment camps. The period of dormancy is over. It’s time to become more aware and, if need be, angry.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annabel Li thinks the perception of Asian Americans as a passive minority needs to change.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/998854f3488f339f5348c550901aa13e?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/998854f3488f339f5348c550901aa13e?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/annabel-li/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Annabel Li</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Annabel Li is a first-year math major who has an active interest in finance.

However, more serious migraines have made it so that at times I am on the verge of vomiting, sensitive to the faintest light, sound or smell and even partly lose the ability to see.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86729\" style=\"width: 349px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86729\" data-attachment-id=\"86729\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/healthcare-in-college-is-a-total-headache/opinionhealthcare-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=2000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"OpinionHealthCare-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86729\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01-250x250.png?resize=339%2C339\" alt=\"\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86729\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elaborate new treatments for migraines are always popping up, with tantalizing FDA-approved labels and seductive promises of reduced and less severe headache days. Sometimes, the treatments seem ridiculous: Botox injections to the head, menthol-infused patches, weird-looking headbands that contain electrodes. But recently, when the FDA approved one out of just three injectable migraine drugs on the market, I immediately knew that I wanted to get my hands on it.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the American healthcare system is a dense jungle of red tape, and getting a prescription for the injectable medication turned out to be borderline impossible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You aren’t a good candidate for this drug,” my neurologist told me, as he handed me a prescription for an anti-seizure drug called Topamax instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You haven’t tried enough medications for your insurance company to cover this one,” which essentially meant that if I wanted the injection, I would have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket every month  — just to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potentially </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel okay. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus began yet another seemingly endless trial-and-error run with a foreign medication, and for the third year in a row, I resigned myself to physical pain and chemical cocktails, hoping that the side effects wouldn’t be all-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fear of side effects didn’t emerge from nowhere; it had happened before and I was positive that it could happen again. During my freshman year of college, I switched brands of birth control from a standard 21-days-on/seven-days-off cycle to one that increased my hormone levels every week —  dually managing to make my painful periods even worse </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slamming me with a blindsiding depression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent the first two quarters of my second year in a tailspin. Crying fits would spring up out of nowhere and an increasingly volatile relationship with the person I had considered my best friend was making it all the worse. It took until spring break to admit to myself that what had once been rattled off as a potential side effect had grown into an autonomous beast, encompassing my entire existence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My personal experience with Prozac has been ideal. On the first sunny day, a few weeks into spring quarter, I found myself imbued with a newfound appreciation for life and sat on the Arbor lawn for over an hour basking in my gratitude. While that initial burst of euphoria doesn’t last forever, Prozac has done wonders in anchoring me to the world — a trait that was very much appreciated when a death in the family during spring quarter hit and I realized that had I not been on antidepressants, my grief would have been exponentially more explosive.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the American healthcare system is a dense jungle of red tape, and getting a prescription for the injectable medication turned out to be borderline impossible.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every experience can be as simple and as painless as my trial with Prozac, which was ironically needed to curb a side effect gone rogue. The migraine medication I take now, Topamax, has catapulted both my body and my mind through a never-ending loop of misery: numbness of the extremities, indigestion so severe that I can barely stomach any food that isn’t unexciting and bland, severe dehydration, tiredness, sluggishness, nervousness, loss of appetite, weight loss. But worst of all, beyond any of the frustrating physical symptoms, is what it has done to my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being on an anti-seizure medication inhibits brain function and having this knowledge is infuriating when there isn’t a damn thing to do about it. I can feel my thoughts forming slowly, like a late 90s computer would load a webpage on Internet Explorer. I feel myself slipping academically, and I have to consciously choose whether or not to produce my optimal standard of work or open myself up to the possibility of earth-shattering migraines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no support available for these kinds of problems in university because, quite frankly, there is nothing to be done. Healthcare is a personal choice to make and ultimately, I am the only person who can decide for myself if these horrible side effects are worth the head-splitting pain I’ve experienced on a weekly basis for the past twelve years of my life. And I still don’t know. That being said though, dealing with side effects that affect academic performance is an incredibly isolating experience — especially when the typical response from friends, counselors, TAs, doctors and professors alike is, “Wow, that sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiencing medical crises or medication-induced side effects that have impacted my academic career has been a lonely experience. Friends who do not experience similar health issues rarely sympathize, and I have regularly feared that sharing these problems with my TAs and professors will mark me as a complainer, an excuse-maker or someone who just isn’t trying hard enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be there for the people in your life who are facing academic struggles due to health problems. Make an effort to get dinner with them, plan study dates, or even just ask them how they’re </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doing</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Feeling like a stranger in your own body is jarring enough, and the added stress of falling behind in school can only make your sense of self more removed. While it’s certainly nobody else’s job or obligation to deal with that, having a good support system makes an insurmountable difference. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson wants to hear something better than, “Wow, that sucks.” </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

There are few topics that are taboo to discuss. Perhaps this transparency has to do with the fact that the Netherlands is </span><a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/european-countries-by-population-density.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the most densely populated countries in Europe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – the tightly packed houses and the famed Dutch aversion to curtains cultivates a different concept of privacy. It’s not uncommon to hear people openly discussing personal health issues or their sex lives over a cup of coffee. When I was an awkward tween, I remember being mortified when my grandmother bluntly asked in front of my extended family if I had gotten my period yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have ever visited the Netherlands, you may have picked up on the fact that it is a nation of straight talk. If someone suggests getting lunch, a simple no suffices if you’re not in the mood. It’s not uncommon to hear someone outwardly telling a friend that they aren’t a fan of their new hairstyle. While this bluntness may come across as plain rude to many, the Dutch view the truth as honest and productive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I ran into some Dutch exchange students in the Isla Vista Food Co-op the other day, I asked them what they thought of UCSB. They raved mostly about the weather– which is no surprise considering the Netherlands averages </span><a href=\"https://www.xpat.nl/moving-to-netherlands/netherlands-facts/climate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 minutes of precipitation per day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But they also said, “You Americans need to stop pretending to be so happy and nice all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the States, if you don’t love your friend’s new haircut, you may tell them they look “unique.” Or you may agree to “get lunch sometime,” even when you know that lunch is definitely not going to happen. While I value politeness and I would still never outwardly tell a friend their new hair is hideous, I’ve come to learn that a little dose of directness can go a long way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year in Writing 2, I was peer editing a paper that was – for a lack of a better word – garbage. The previous editor left little smiley faces in her colorful Papermate felt-tip pens, and a comment along of the lines of, “Well, I really liked this part, but maybe possibly this part can sort-of-kind-of be tweaked a tiny little bit!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping Dutch directness in mind, I told the writer upfront that the paper wasn’t good but that I could help him out. Through this interaction, we ended up working together on our papers and became friends outside of class. Not only was the direct communication more efficient, but I made a friend out of it as well. Often times, cutting the convoluted crap makes it easier to connect with people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. When waiters ask how the food is, you’re expected to say it’s delicious. Or my personal least favorite – the “Hey, how are you?”  “I’m great, how are you?”</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m good!” interaction. I’ll be the first to admit I engage in these scripted interactions all the time – and I hate it.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, I went on a road trip with some family visiting from the Netherlands. We were in an elevator in a Hilton hotel when a man noticed my aunt’s pouty face. When he asked how she was doing,  – instead of responding with the typical, “I’m good, you?” – my aunt told him she was upset because she was promised a room with two queens but ended up in a room with one king. The man charismatically responded, “You’re in Vegas! You shouldn’t be upset!” and brought her to the front desk to have her upgraded to a penthouse suite. My aunt thanked him for his kindness and when he left, she asked the staff who this random man was. Turns out, that random man was Mr. Hilton himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going beyond the expected line of conversation and not pretending to be “good” all the time can lead somewhere much more interesting. The Dutch culture of honest talk, while it does take some getting used to, allows for more authentic conversations and often results in some pretty good stories to tell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, differences in communication styles are deeply ingrained in culture, and that’s not something that is going to change. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to tell a dinner host I don’t like their cooking. But I do believe we can all benefit from being more direct. So next time someone asks how it’s going, try going beyond the fact that it’s going well. You might just be pleasantly surprised at what follows. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Britt de Visser encourages Gauchos to be more honest in future interactions.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/britt-de-visser/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Britt de Visser</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Britt de Visser is an Opinion Staff writer.

How do I tell my girlfriend that she’s bad at eating me out? How can I help her get better?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating the physical aspects of a relationship can often seem more daunting and confusing than other parts. There are so many levels of vulnerability when it comes to physical relationships that the fear hurting, confusing or even embarrassing our partner can stop us from addressing an issue or feeling. That being said, it is important to remember that the advice I am giving you is very general and that you know your girlfriend as well as your relationship with her more than I do so use your best judgment when trying to determine how she will react to certain things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would stray from telling her she is bad at eating you out and try to frame it in a way that is focused on you: for example, you could tell her that you really like when she does one thing over another or even show her what feels good for you. From my experience, when I have been with someone who doesn’t know what feels good for me, showing or helping them goes a long way. Additionally, if you ask your girlfriend what feels good for her, it can help alleviate some of the pressure she may feel from trying to pleasure you. I have also found that being responsive to a partner can be very encouraging. You could moan or tell your girlfriend it feels good which will help reinforce more of the positive actions.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a reminder, sex is not what this culture has made it out to be and to that end it is certainly not what we see in the movies. There is so much pressure to have these magical, perfect, orgasmic if you will hookups on the first try, but that is so unrealistic. It takes time and communication to become familiar with your partner’s body. You could have a ton of amazing sex with one partner yet be far from getting another partner there. I believe that a good sexual partner hasn’t necessarily had copious amounts of sex or had an extensive list of sexual partners but is aware of their partner and how what they’re doing makes them feel. Reassure your girlfriend of these things and make sure she knows that you’re in this together.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>🝊</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ! There’s a cute guy who works at the Starbucks in the UCen. How do I ask him out in the right way without making him feel pressured?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow meet cute of the quarter for sure &lt;3 Just as a preface, I think this is one of those times you’ve got to be prepared to go all in. Because he works at the UCen Starbucks, you run the risk of having to see him again even if things don’t work out. While I have full faith and confidence in you, this possibility is something to keep in mind but not something that should keep you from asking him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, I would write the following message on a napkin and give it to one of the other baristas to give to him:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His name, Coffee date?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Your full name, your phone number”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you don’t stay in there after giving the napkin to the barista. This way, he has your name, your number, knows you’re interested and is in a relatively lower pressure situation than if you were to say something to him. Now he has time to do all of the necessary creeping on your social media and let you know when he wants to meet up with you :) SHOOT YO SHOT BABYYYY.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>🝊</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I can’t kick my coffee addiction. Help!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re anything like me, caffeine has become imperative to life as a college student. Between academics, work, some semblance of a social life and crippling procrastination, coffee became my crutch. If it’s the coffee you’re trying to cut and not necessarily the caffeine, I would suggest switching to a tea. However, if you’re trying to lower your caffeine intake, I would definitely try to reduce your “need” for caffeine by adjusting your sleep schedule and depleting your dependency by only drinking caffeine when you absolutely need it. Making an effort to get at least eight hours of sleep per night has changed my life. I have seen noticeable differences in my focus, retention and productivity in addition to reducing the amount of caffeine I consume. If that wasn’t enough to convince you, just think about all of the money you could save (about $1,100 a year assuming you spend $3 per day on coffee) AND you won’t have to hold your caffeine poops in during class.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

You’re not really in the mood for debauchery in your good Christian home; you genuinely just want to watch TV, but your date has other plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you are, sitting innocently on the couch, and suddenly there’s an arm around you. This seems fine until you notice that there’s no room for Jesus left between you two. Much to your dismay, the movie ends, and all you’re left with is wandering hands and an increasingly awkward silence.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For whatever reason, sex just isn’t on the table. Maybe it’s because your date’s breath is rich with that heavenly aroma of dining commons pizza, maybe they forgot deodorant or maybe you just plain don’t want to. Nonetheless, you’ve got some great sexpectations on your hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In situations like these, I normally uncomfortably laugh and go hide in my bathroom, but I realize that’s not exactly socially acceptable, so I reached out to two other Gauchos to get their advice. First, I sat down with my friend who was brave enough to discuss her harrowing, romantic encounter with the man now known as the “One Titty Wonder.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was on a really boring date with this guy who really didn’t talk to me much at all, and when he did it was mostly just to make bad jokes with sexual innuendos. I would’ve tried to leave, but he was my ride home, and when we pulled up next to my house he stopped the car and I could tell he kind of wanted to say something.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was about to break the silence and he reached over and grabbed my boob out of my bra, so I was just sitting there with one boob hanging out of my T-shirt. After that I just kind of scooped my boob back in and skirted out of there. My advice would be to make sure that your date respects your boobs’ dignity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your date isn’t quite so invasive and you feel like you can just talk your way out of it, don’t you worry — I spoke to another anonymous Gaucho who has just the excuse you’ve been looking for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I had this cuddle buddy last year that I knew from back home. I made it clear that he was just a cuddle buddy, too, to avoid confusion. The last time I saw him was when I invited him to my room to cuddle. He started making moves and I wasn’t into it. Then he tried undoing my belt and said, ‘I wanna see your vagina.’”</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is a very sexually liberated campus, sex is always subject to consent and respect; it’s not something you can buy with a shot of Kirkland vodka or expect after a set number of dates (I know sharing nachos is an intimate experience, but please be a consensual Casanova).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To that I brushed his hands away and got up quickly as I said I was on my period and was super heavy. Tampons and pad type of day. He looked confused and sat down in my chair. He had to stay in the awkward silence for his dick to be less visible through his pants. There ya go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stories show that sex is often seen as an expectation after two or three dates, or even one if a big spender drops upwards of $10 on your food.

As we are presented with more opportunities — opportunities to make new connections, join different organizations, pursue new leadership roles or take on a job or internship — the pressure builds.

Comparing preference night outfits and bids are a thing of the past —  irrelevant and juvenile, even. Now the stakes suddenly seem more real when I instead find myself comparing summer plans and LinkedIn profiles. Another friend has just landed the internship of his dreams, but I still have no idea what I’m doing this summer. What am I lacking? Am I falling behind? No one wants to be a sore loser and, at your core, you know that’s not who you are because you still feel genuinely happy for him. But being happy for your friend’s success isn’t enough to stop the sinking feeling in your stomach.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In times of stress and uncertainty, I’ve found that for most people, it’s almost impossible not to compare yourself to those around you. Maybe we start out looking for guidance or reassurance that other people feel just as lost as we do. Other times, we use our peers as markers to measure our achievements, or lack thereof. Although habits like these are hard to break, the longer we allow ourselves to stay in this mentality of constant comparison, the more we’ll hurt ourselves in the end. After all, when you’re competing against the world, you’re rarely going to come out on top.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society — pressures to excel at academics and extracurriculars, pressures from family members and friends — but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves. Much of the stress, anxiety and despair we feel comes from trying in vain to meet unrealistic expectations created by our perceptions of others. Despite convincing outward appearances, no one has their whole life figured out. Although it can be easy to be consumed by the desire to keep up with our peers and “do it all,” doing so will only lead to an inevitable spiral of negativity and self-doubt. Instead, take a step back and choose a different path for yourself. Your success doesn’t have to be measured by someone else’s. Although humans may be competitive by nature, remember: the game of life doesn’t have to be a competition.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu wants you to take a deep breath — you’re doing great!</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

For the majority of my life, I identified with this sentiment so when the rain began this winter quarter, I was all but excited. I would wake up to the patter of rain on my windowsill and roll over in bed unenthused about what lay ahead of me: just another day of wrangling the pesky zippers of my raincoat that always seem to get caught on the surrounding fabric; another day of battling the faulty umbrella button whose only purpose is to open up the simple device, but always seems to fail at doing just that; another day destined to be ruined by factors out of my control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular Tuesday during week four, my skin felt especially sticky and my hair exceptionally frizzy from the humidity of my soggy classrooms. I was yearning especially hard for my shower of revitalization. On my walk back home, I texted my housemate to assure that the shower would be free upon my arrival. While looking down at my phone, I carelessly stepped in a puddle, soaking my socks all the way though. I bit my lip, let out a sigh and trudged on with the the words “I hate the rain” circling through my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I reached the bus loop roundabout, a guy sheltering himself with not one but two umbrellas biked past me. As I watched him ride away, I pondered the effectiveness of this strategy. I decided that Melania Trump could probably benefit from the second umbrella better than he could, although it was not my place to make suggestions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I continued on past SSMS, I noticed a bicyclist with something on his head. “A helmet?” I thought. “That’s rare to see at UCSB.” But alas, it was something even rarer — a plastic bag crafted into a rain mask, eye-holes and all. I remember in childhood being strictly informed to never put a plastic bag over my head to avoid accidental suffocation. I guess this principle becomes null when facing the threat of getting one’s cheeks a little wet. This irony amused me as I walked onward.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86444\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86444\" data-attachment-id=\"86444\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/take-a-rain-check-on-your-rain-resentment/screen-shot-2019-02-25-at-1-57-49-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=1288%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-25 at 1.57.49 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=888%2C890&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86444\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM-250x250.png?resize=381%2C381\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=768%2C769&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1022%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1022w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86444\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path began to veer left, wrapping its way around the Thunderdome. The sparsity of buildings in this area of campus means less shelter, so I quickly felt the wind pick up around me. I held my hand in front of my face to shield my eyes from the raindrops darting about. While this did obstruct my vision to a considerable degree, I could not help but notice a massive pink blob making its way toward me. I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders. She had neither a raincoat nor an umbrella, just Harry Styles to protect her from the rain. Raindrops rolled down his cheeks from his deep blue eyes. It looked as if he was weeping while bearing his charming dimpled smile. I chuckled to myself at this ridiculous sight.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

Usually, I would have viewed the glittering “Hesperous is Phosphorus” as the literal light at the end of the tunnel of my wet, gloomy trek back to I.V. This time, however, the landmark did not strike me so. There was no bad mood to overcome. I was already content. In analyzing the innovative rain repellant strategies along my walk, I had shed my deep-rooted aversion to the rain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These past few weeks, when I awake to the pattering on my windowsill, I cannot say that I spring up out of bed ready to splash around in puddles belting “I’m Singin’ in the Rain.” I can say, however, that I no longer dread my drizzly walk to class the way I used to. Before, the rain to me was simply an oppressive force, dictating the clothes I’d wear, the places I’d go and my means of getting there. Yet, in recognizing the funky quirks and crafty contraptions that the rain brings out in my fellow Isla Vistans, I am able to find joy in my community, rain or shine.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages Gauchos to embrace the rain.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.

A blink of an eye and a college acceptance later, the simple times of high school begin to seem so distant that they almost resemble a distant childhood memory. Between midterms, balancing surfing schedules, and constantly wondering how to impress Chancellor Yang, it seems impossible to find enough time to sleep. Now imagine throwing a relationship — let alone commitment — into the mix. On the one hand, it can be rewarding and freeing to launch into your first adult relationship.

As each met their demise, I began to uncover exactly what factors into a relationship. Is it culture? Could it be morality or overall attitude? For many, it seems that there is a large correlation between romance and background. When it comes to my own, the defining factor is the fact that I grew up amidst my parents’ ugly divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first view of dating and relationships was somewhat cynical. At age eight, I was convinced that true love was a hoax and that devotion to another person was a waste of time. It took years to begin to trust flirtatious men, and the only way I could do so was by distancing myself from what my parents had been telling, and inadvertently showing, me for years. It was a big adjustment for me to ask my first boyfriend to drop me off at “Mom’s place” or “Dad’s.” In my home state of Washington, only </span><a href=\"https://www.mollybkenny.com/library/washington-state-divorce-rate-washington-divorce-statistics.cfm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.6 out of every 1,000 </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">families divorced in 2014, and that statistic often haunted me when it came to making friends or important first impressions. There were times when I considered hiding my family’s situation, claiming my dad was always working or my mom was just around the corner having wine with a neighbor. The gist is that my parents ignore each other’s existence, and it used to be humiliating. When I first entered the dating scene, I participated in all the girly gossip of high school sophomores. Unlike many of my peers, I had no “meet the parents” family dinners, where my partner would nervously tug at his tie or call my parents “sir” and “ma’am.” I still often question exactly what childhood experiences or family stature best prepare someone for a healthy, prosperous relationship. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my first quarter and a half of college, this question has been increasingly heightened. Dating in college is already a mess. It’s just one more bowling pin to juggle, and I turn to my parents quite often as I slide my way into adulthood. I used to find it impossible to know when to consider their relationship guidance, my fear of ending up a divorcee getting in the way. Sometimes asking for advice even felt like I was squeezing lime juice into the wound of my parents’ failed marriage. I was scared of commitment because I never had a model that demonstrated how it was done or no one ever showed me how it was achieved. However, due to this dilemma, I have taught myself the most important key to dating. Because I have the opportunity to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use my parents as a cookie cutter example of a flawlessly operating relationship, I can carefully select what to value or leave behind when they offer me suggestions. I now choose what lessons they teach me about dating to internalize and to take to heart, and in turn, I am beginning to learn who I am as a girlfriend by my own standards. This was my “eureka” moment in that what once gave me grief and embarrassment now gives me an exceptional amount of freedom.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes asking for advice even felt like I was squeezing lime juice into the wound of my parents’ failed marriage.

It is crucial to keep in mind that, no matter your demographics, college relationships can be tricky to balance. Remembering your roots at certain times will weigh you down but there are also moments when you can redefine them. Taking a look at the mistakes made by those who raised you can make a huge difference in how you choose to formulate your identity, as my parents’ errors have helped shape who I will be in the future. It’s okay to leave a part of where you come from in the rearview mirror when looking to understand who you, as an individual, are beginning to be.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Rollins would like to emphasize that you may have to become less like your parents to become more you. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c31a4351f865a0226af40b21e9559068?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c31a4351f865a0226af40b21e9559068?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophia-rollins/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sophia Rollins</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sophia Rollins is an Opinion staff writer from rainy Seattle, Washington.

In other words, vaporizing reduces exposure to the gaseous toxins associated with combustion of cannabis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as eco-friendly smoking goes on an individual basis, there were limited comments and conclusions about the actual method of smoking, but more about the ways in which you could reduce your “cannabis carbon footprint.” Recycling your weed bottles and vaporizer batteries, using non-toxic glass cleaner and actually throwing away your roaches are a few simple ways you can be more environmentally conscious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just food for thought:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While recycling and non-toxic glass cleaner are great, it may also be a good idea to consider the</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/20/cannabis-climate-change-fossil-fuels\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of corporate weed industry on the environment, but that’s for another article.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✸</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do you properly ask a guy out since it’s kind of awkward because guys are supposed to ask girls?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chivalry is dead and you are a strong, independent woman capable of asking this lucky mans on a date! Whether a girl or a guy is making the first move, the uncertainty of asking someone out is usually awkward or a little stressful. If you’re nervous, I would start by asking him to get coffee with you sometime. Getting coffee isn’t too fancy and allows you to be in a public space where you can get to know each other on a more personal level. To that end, sometimes getting coffee can be kind of ambiguous in terms of intentions, so I would say after you get coffee (and hopefully by this point you’ve exchanged numbers) make sure he knows what your intentions are. You can do this!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✸</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>So I’m gay, and there’s this cute guy on my floor and not so sure if he’s gay. Should I talk to him? How?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My initial reaction was to tell you to absolutely make some moves! Talking to someone you’re attracted to whether physically or intellectually is intimidating amongst other feelings of anxiety, but that interaction can do a lot for you. You could quickly find out this person isn’t someone you want to be involved with, or you could end up becoming close friends with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I started to question my own advice. All of my thoughts have been based on my own experiences, and I think it would be heteronormative of me to assume that you would be in the same position as I would be in trying to talk to someone romantically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This question actually really got me thinking about sexuality and romantic interactions. As someone who is cishet, I have to admit I haven’t spent enough time thinking about queer sexual experiences, and concerning this question specifically, I haven’t thought about how navigating relationships would be different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think about talking to someone I’m interested in, I assume they’re hetero, and from my experience when I’ve been wrong I have been faced with nothing but kindness. For some reason – **<em>cough cough heteronormativity and toxic masculinity</em>** – if you were to assume someone was queer, there’s a chance that their response could be extremely negative – god forbid a straight, cis-gendered, testosterone-filled man is thought to be gay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an ideal world, if this guy turns out to be hetero he would just tell you he wasn’t interested, but there is part of me that fears that he could treat you terribly. That being said I wish you resilience, I wish you love and I wish you the kindness that everyone deserves. If you decide to talk to him (which I still think you should), I would say you should ask him to go to the beach sometime or maybe do something in a group.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

In the last year, we’ve seen celebrities accused of sexual assault be “canceled” and all their work invalidated and boycotted. But it doesn’t stop there: celebrities that make just about any mistake fall into the same category of “canceled” as these accused celebrities. Although the boycott is sometimes completely justified, people seem to often take it too far or too seriously, not realizing that there is a difference between an artist and their art.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86440\" style=\"width: 296px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86440\" data-attachment-id=\"86440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/art-v-artist/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,1011\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"art v artist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist-185x250.jpg?resize=286%2C386\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow me to drop a mind-blowing fact real quick: celebrities are human too.

Twitter didn’t take a second to breathe and do background research before exploding on Hart for his mistakes. This is where the debate of whether or not art should be viewed as separate from the artist comes in: should Kevin Hart be allowed to perform given his problematic past?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the internet fad of canceling celebrities at the snap of a finger, it was much easier for consumers to draw a line between an artist and their art. In modern society, however, that line is blurred and sometimes nonexistent. Picasso was misogynistic, yet his art is still considered some of the best in the world. William Golding was an attempted rapist, but his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lord of the Flies </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is still taught in high schools across the nation. J.D. Salinger was a pedophile, yet he is considered one of the greatest American authors of all time, and his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Catcher in the Rye </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the most widely-read novels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, consumers of entertainment have decided to take more responsibility for holding celebrities accountable for their actions, but it has gotten to the point where celebrities can’t take a single step out of place without risking everything. I’m in no way condoning the previously mentioned artists’ behavior; I’m just stating that these artists are different from their art and their work, and that their personalities should be considered separately. Supporting an artist’s work is not equivalent to supporting their actions, to a certain extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This line gets a little hazy with artists who haven’t just made small mistakes. On one end of the spectrum of #canceled celebrities are celebrities like Kevin Hart and on the other end are celebrities like Tekashi 6ix9ine, R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. For the latter artists mentioned, it becomes harder to support their work without feeling like you’re condoning their actions. Although there is an extreme difference between Kevin Hart’s eight-year-old homophobic tweets and Bill Cosby’s </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple sexual assault charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both have fallen victim to canceled culture. Making the separation between an artist and their art was definitely easier before the Internet, and although I believe it’s still important, it becomes more difficult with celebrities on the extreme end of the spectrum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a wide range of actions that can make a celebrity fall victim to the hashtag, and what irks me is that no matter where you fall on this spectrum, you get sentenced to #canceled for life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a good middle ground that society can take on this issue is to be more accepting and lenient towards work from artists who have made active efforts to learn from their mistakes and move forward. Let me be clear: this doesn’t apply to the Bill Cosbys or R. Kellys of the world, but it does apply to the Kevin Harts. Kevin Hart has made a public and conscious effort to right his wrongs and move on with his life, and we should not judge his comedy in light of his personal mistakes. We’re putting too much pressure on ourselves as consumers to evaluate what should and shouldn’t be appreciated due to the actions of their creators. Instead, we should appreciate art for what it is, rather than blaming ourselves for “supporting” an artist’s slightly problematic past.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alysha Agarwal urges people to discern between an artist’s actions and their work.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/","id":6281,"author":{"id":383,"name":"Alysha Agarwal"},"related":[6280,6279,6278],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Argument in the Office: Quarter vs. Semester System","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Argument in the Office","publish_date":"2019-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Carla Wenzel and Autumn Murphy consider the pros and cons of the two education systems.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The Quarter System is a Half-Baked Approach to Education</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Carla Wenzel</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friends back home in Berlin are just starting to enter the panic mode that gets you through your finals. So far, their semester in Germany has been going rather uneventfully and besides a presentation in class, give or take, the pressure is minimal. On the other side of the pond, I have already experienced my first breakdown during finals week and enjoyed the major relief period after.

The major difference that comes to my mind is the length of the terms: semesters versus quarters. The term length directly relates to the depth of the education — or rather the lack thereof. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you compare the quarter and the semester system, six-month-long terms are superior to three-month-long terms because they give students the opportunity to really internalize complex topics. I like the fact that I get to learn about more topics in one academic year in the quarter system at UCSB. Nevertheless, I believe that 10 weeks is just not enough time to truly get to the bottom of any topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is not due to the total amount of time spent to study a specific topic because the units for every course are equivalent between the systems. It is rather the fact that a class taken in 10 weeks requires a much faster learning pace than one required by the same class in the semester system. The speed of the quarter system requires students to plan ahead and prioritize whichever quizzes or presentations are next. This style of learning may encourage stress management and multitasking. Above all, however, the quarter system teaches students to only learn content that will appear on the exam and to forget all “irrelevant” information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No question: the quarter system allows you to cover more topics in one academic year and if you are unhappy with your classes,  you only have to get through the 10 weeks. However, if you decide to go to college, you should be interested in the material you are studying or at least have a future career goal in mind that makes pushing through tough classes worthwhile. The purpose of studying at a university involves getting to know all different angles of a topic and then learning to argue on the basis of this knowledge. In general, the broad education of the quarter system lacks the depth of the knowledge gained in the semester system.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system teaches students to only learn content that will appear on the exam and to forget all “irrelevant” information.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one more specific aspect that I really like about the semester system: students are required to write long papers. Yes, you read that right — I want to write more than just the casual four pages, double-spaced. Speaking as an undergraduate student in the social sciences, I believe it is important to have the chance to write up to 20 pages about a scientific problem in your field. As a part of this journey, undergraduates should have the opportunity to explain and understand difficult material step-by-step, by writing not only summary papers but also argumentative ones with a theoretical background. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is also a time to develop your own views on the world. This process takes time and involves the opportunity to take wrong turns. Once students have stepped out of the university context into the real world, there will not be as much time to question one’s own view over and over — so why rush through university like it is a crash course? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter and semester systems have different goals. While the quarter system allows students to gain a broader view on many different topics and teaches them to work efficiently under high pressure, the semester system leaves more time to approach difficult material in-depth. Rather than rushing through many different subjects and only remembering a few parts, I would rather take the extra time to expand my knowledge and be able to think outside the box. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carla Wenzel encourages students of the quarter system to think beyond a surface level about what they are learning. </span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86367\" style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86367\" data-attachment-id=\"86367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/argument-in-the-office-quarter-vs-semester-system/semvqtr/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=650%2C704&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,704\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"semvQtr\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=231%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=888%2C962&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?resize=435%2C471\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"471\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The Quarter System Optimizes the College Experience</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Autumn Murphy</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB students love to hate the dreaded quarter system. Ten weeks, 12 units minimum and never enough time to soak in the information that you’re given. The quarter system does not fare well for people who aren’t on top of their game, as they slip through the cracks when midterms and assignments pile up. Even staff complain that there’s not enough time to know all of their students, and before we know it, the quarter is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from a community college, I have the benefit of having experienced both systems. The quarter system is superior because you’ll never get bored. Students have freedom to wiggle around with their majors, along with being able to take summer sessions to make up missed units during the year. It’s not uncommon to double major here, and some students even take on a double minor on top of that. When I first got here, I thought people were lying to me when they said they took on multiple majors, but I soon realized that this was possible when I was exposed to the amount of time the quarter system gives them. The quarter system gives us just that: freedom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted, it doesn’t give us time to relax at all, especially with midterms starting in week two, but as soon as you know it, the quarter’s over and you’re onto a new round of professors and TAs. If you hate a certain someone in your classes, whether it be a strict grader or a professor that can’t teach, you end up leaving them in less than three months, instead of spending almost half a year relying on them as you would on the semester system.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system gives us just that: freedom.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fail a class on the quarter system, it’s simply not as big of a deal as failing a class on the semester system. The quarter system gives students the ability to retake failed classes at any given time. It’s even apparent in the culture. If you failed a class at my community college, it would set you back almost an entire year, and other students would look at you as if you were a failure. Failing classes at UCSB is almost so commonplace that no one bats an eye at you if you do it because there’s always an opportunity to recover and it doesn’t necessarily make you look like a bad student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since most semester students only have eight semesters to complete college in four years, compared to having twelve quarters, it is crucial for them to map out a four-year plan in their first year. Students with time-consuming and research-intensive majors have to course-related decisions quickly, as changing majors can have significant setbacks. Unlike the semester-system schools, UCSB allows students to take classes they want to, whenever they want to, which may be a reason why we have so many students tacking on multiple majors and minors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing classes into such a short time frame may seem counterintuitive because of the perceived lack of depth, but it allows students to find their strengths and weaknesses early on. Community colleges may even be better off overall with the quarter system, as students there have even more freedom than UC students do, thanks to lower tuition costs and fewer specialized courses such as general ed classes. If all colleges had the quarter system, the transition from the semester to quarter system would potentially be less harsh, and students would be able to transfer out faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system also allows students to study abroad without missing much school. As I am preparing to study abroad in Australia for next fall, I was astonished at the number of units I was receiving: a sheer 24 quarter units minimum. I was worried about missing time at UCSB as it will be my last fall quarter here. But as I thought about it more, a quarter is only 10 weeks and I won’t be missing that much — I.V. can only change so much while you’re away. Even if you go abroad during the spring and miss two quarters, you still receive the same number of units you would at home. You would even have time to come back and take short summer session classes to make up any units you missed while away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be receiving more units or being given more leeway in regard to your studies, the quarter system enables students to get the most out of their college experience. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autumn Murphy encourages students to think more deeply about how the quarter system benefits them.</span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6282813d4bbd8beecb1d9bc867033283?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6282813d4bbd8beecb1d9bc867033283?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/autumn-murphy/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Autumn Murphy</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Autumn Murphy is a third-year communication major and loves to spend her free time ballroom dancing and listening to Taylor Swift.

I went to a 50 percent white school system on the border of two rich suburbs where most of my friends lived. Until I was about 15, I truly believed I fit right in with my surroundings. However, things started to change as I grew older and became aware of the uniqueness of my situation. I was one of the few in my friend group who had been followed by workers in grocery stores, randomly searched at airports and been the target of racist statements. Although my classmates may have viewed these remarks as innocent jokes, I believe they promoted toxic beliefs about my own identity. What bothered me more was that not only did my classmates think it was okay to make these comments, but expected me to brush them off. When I expressed my discomfort, I was accused of “being sensitive” or “acting like a pussy.” I had grown up with these people, shared experiences with them. Why would I find these comments offensive if they didn’t?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It kind of made sense, didn’t it? My skin was relatively fair for a brown kid. I benefited from an above-average public school system and never really had to worry about money at home growing up. I never learned Farsi and couldn’t participate in many of the family conversations on my dad’s side, while my Spanish three-level vocabulary left much to be desired on my mom’s side. I had not immigrated to the country by myself as my dad did at 14, and I was never forced to drop out of school and join the army like my Mexican grandpa did to gain American citizenship. My family did an incredible job creating opportunities for me, and due to this, I felt I could not fully relate to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt as if I was in this complex, overlapping Venn diagram in which I somehow ended up in a category all by myself in the middle. I was too privileged to identify with my family and too brown to assimilate into the environment afforded by my friends at school. I could sense the disappointment in my extended Iranian family’s faces when I informed them I couldn’t speak Farsi. According to my mom, my first name was almost Pablo, yet I could sense the confusion on my opponent’s face when I used Spanish on the soccer field when we played a predominantly Latino team. Gaining full acceptance without alienating the other half of me was not something I was going to achieve. Growing up I only really had to worry about my grades, girls and soccer and I felt extremely guilty about it. Guilty that I had simply settled with not immersing myself in the worlds my separate environments provided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I still kind of do to this day. It’s not something I can fix or change. It’s how I grew up, it’s part of my identity. I am never going to fit the typical profile of either of my cultures, and accepting that was the first step to feeling okay about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In American culture, there seems to be conflicting expectations regarding the conduct of minorities, especially for mixed-race populations. The authenticity of President Obama’s blackness was constantly questioned due to his white mother, yet he was held to arguably the highest standards any American president has had to face due to his skin. Critics of Colin Kaepernick have repeatedly called his movement and its message invalid due to the fact that he was adopted by a white family during his childhood, yet he still finds himself blackballed by the NFL more than two years later. There seems to be a switch the American majority can choose to flip whenever the situation calls for it. Whatever side of you that fits their narrative is the one that is going to be highlighted to match the current agenda. It’s why growing up people from school felt they could make racist jokes at my expense and question my Latino heritage due to “not speaking Mexican” the next (I could go into the problematic racial implications of that statement all day, but that’s a tangent for another time).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt as if I was in this complex, overlapping Venn diagram in which I somehow ended up in a category all by myself in the middle. I was too privileged to identify with my family and too brown to assimilate into the environment afforded by my friends at school.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I struggled to navigate my way through the contradictions and code-switching, I quickly realized that there was no manual for me to follow. There was very little, if any, representation in media that could have provided a blueprint for how to conduct myself growing up as mixed-race individual in American society, much less as a growing Mexican-Iranian man. Not one show. Not one famous athlete. I eventually realized that I was one of the first people to grow up on this frontline of mixed-race America. When I was 16, that kind of terrified me. As I grew older and began to understand the racial transition in which this country is going through, I’ve realized that people like me will represent a normal occurrence in society. At 21, this realization that used to frighten me is now almost exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can count the number of Iranian-Mexican people I’ve met in my life on one hand, and two of them are my cousins. Yet America is changing, whether the old white people like it or not. More of me will come, and soon America will live up to the “melting pot” name with which it so exuberantly brands itself. I am a mix of two minorities, yet I have opportunities that are simply not granted easily to people who share either of my identities. My authenticity may always be questioned, and probably for good reasons. I am not my ancestors, I have not lived their lives. I am not them. But it’s important I take the advantages I’ve been given and the future platforms of expression that I may receive. My family didn’t work this hard for me to be stuck in some box you check on a census. How else will this country move forward if minorities are continually hit with some sort of excuse for their success when they break the barriers built by years of systemic suppression? Just because I can’t be easily categorized doesn’t mean I don’t have to live the rest of my life with an asterisk next to it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti is starting to become content with being an outlier.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

While the amount and content of coursework is comparable, I came to appreciate my previous experiences in open debate and in-depth student presentations. At home, TAs were mainly in charge of sparking discussion through controversy based on readings rather than desperately trying to find a student to read aloud the assigned weekly paper and then spend the rest of section summarizing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first year, students were essentially thrown in at the deep end, a phenomenon which is exemplified by the absence of prompts in essay assignments. While this may seem daunting, it effectively taught me how to structure and develop a thesis beyond set standards of what is considered right or wrong. Rather than myopically following instructions, this teaching style facilitated the formation of opinions and proved rewarding both academically, by improving argumentative originality, as well as personally, by inducing the feeling of having produced my own work.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83730\" style=\"width: 422px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83730\" data-attachment-id=\"83730\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-24/sheriffs-deputies-discover-human-remains-near-del-playa-beach/screen-shot-2018-07-25-at-9-20-42-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=2048%2C989&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,989\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-07-25 at 9.20.42 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=888%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-83730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM-250x121.png?resize=412%2C199\" alt=\"\" width=\"412\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=1024%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my global studies courses here are filled with data, graphs and theoretical concepts which are, of course, essential to understanding the topic, yet often counterproductive in initiating debate. While students are on top of their game in factual knowledge given the frequency of homework, quizzes and midterms (which seem to arise at any point but in the middle of term), a critical approach to controversial issues is seldom asked for. Questions on the part of the students are not non-existent but largely directed toward the study guide for the next quiz and clarifications or definitions, which students then obediently type into their MacBooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of my classes, we are supposed to analyse highly ambivalent philosophical texts. Our first paper encouraged institutions to consider students as co-creators of education rather than mere recipients. Having read it, I could not wait for potentially controversial discussions in the gloomy halls of I.V. Theater. In contrast to the critical theory, however, the lecture was a pinpointed summary rather than an analysis, let alone a critique. Ironically, the main thesis — thinking for yourself — of this and subsequent readings seemed like a distant utopia, essentially desirable but expressed in too old a document to apply to our classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corresponding sections nipped any serious debate in the bud by featuring enjoyable yet awkwardly long surveys about our personal lives and monotonous monologues by a TA who seemed to have turned the section into an emotional support group. This is not to downplay the importance of connecting with your peers, but it is quite telling regarding the apparent disinterest of some teaching staff in conveying critical analysis skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessment through multiple choice quizzes effectively tests diligence but undervalues opinion and coherent argumentation, which could be practiced in presentations or group discussions. A clear imperative by professors to respond to exam questions in a way that “resembles the way we talked about them in class” restricts the possibility of an independent and personal analysis from the start. One gets the impression that students are primarily supposed to learn rather than think, let alone learn how to think critically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting to know regular UCSB students during my first weeks in I.V., I experienced the wider social and personal implications to this particular structure of academic life. There appears to be a broad consensus on a clear separation between university and the social environment. “Do your work and then enjoy life” is a motto I have often heard around other Gauchos.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When connecting this experience to the wider social life, it struck me that the largely mechanical learning ideology has counterproductive effects on overall student interaction and may create a negative attitude towards pursuing an academic degree in the first place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than seeing both academia and social life as something that can be unified through subject-related discussions with friends while chugging Natty Daddy’s at Sands, classwork appears to be more like a part-time job than a life-shaping endeavour. Of course, we all finish our essays in the last minute and go out to crash Friday parties on DP, but almost no one comes back to discussing the controversies of the essay topic once sobering up with friends and munching on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jesus Burgers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not at all to demand nerdy discussions or to put an end to the marvelousness of casual trash talk for the sake of upkeeping academic rigour and obsession. It is to say that given a sincere interest in your degree subject, there should be a lot more to most class readings and assignments than the feeling of relief you get when scratching them off your to-do list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being critical of the lack of critical thinking also requires a critical approach to one’s own views. These observations are the source of a highly subjective eight-week experience of an I.V. newcomer. Naturally, this is also a highly restricted depiction of academic life given that the discussion or lack thereof regarding moral controversies are mostly found in the social sciences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends from home FaceTime me and ask about my study abroad experience, I excitedly tell them about I.V.’s welcoming culture, the inexhaustible supplies of the A.S. Food Bank and the electrifying feeling of liberation during sunset surfs. But I also tell them about the one-sided academic culture of memorization and how I miss controversial discussions and self-determined studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My academic culture shock at UCSB has been not so much about the content of the classes but about the way they are taught. By following a high school doctrine of internalizing information instead of analysis-based teaching, the class structure hampers independent thinking and debate between and among students and staff. Consequently, students themselves demand to be taken by the hand and guided through the jungle of homework assignments instead of following their academic passions through specialisation and research. While debating with a friend about the outline of this opinion piece, we realised that the nature of teaching at UCSB has not yet allowed for one of the most exciting and valuable characteristics of university life: learning from your peers. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages UCSB students and staff to foster independent thinking and meaningful discussions both inside and outside the classroom. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simon-ahrens/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simon Ahrens</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simon Ahrens is a second-year Global Studies study-abroad student.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick scroll through the Urban Outfitters’ website initially yields nothing new: overpriced sparkly party frocks, BDG mom jeans and those ugly FILA sneakers for which I can’t bear to jump on the bandwagon. But suddenly I do a double take when I click on the ‘Wellness’ section and see a host of vibrators, dildos and other various sex toys placed innocuously underneath the ‘Self Love’ division. A look at the Free People website reveals the same, albeit more expensive, result. Owned by the same parent company, Anthropologie, this sudden movement of younger-skewed brands to start marketing sex toys to a strongly feminist, sexually liberated generation smells strongly of bullshit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex-positive feminism is nothing new — it has been a movement embedded within the feminist community since the early 1980s. However, it seems that late Millennial and early Generation X women were swayed by the heavy presence of pornography-friendly sites like Tumblr in adolescence, leading to a positive outlook toward sex — notably masturbation and an emphasis on female pleasure. These early steps of social media sex positivity have led to a wide variety of successful multiplatform sex-themed websites and podcasts, including </span><a href=\"https://killerandasweetthang.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killer and a Sweet Thang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys We F****d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOREible Decisions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: all outlets where female-centric, queer-friendly and “taboo” sex practices take center stage. The demographic for brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People experienced a social media-induced sexual awakening in the mid-2010s that led to the radical conclusion that hey — maybe female pleasure isn’t such a big taboo after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset, it seems great that mainstream companies like Urban Outfitters and Free People are jumping at the chance to support female sexuality. But after a closer examination, I am hesitant to buy into the free love narrative fed by a company in which only </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/01/urban-outfitters-board-women/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the executive board is comprised of women. Maybe I’m just jaded, but for some reason, I am reluctant to believe that a bunch of older men of the Urban Outfitters board are super on board with the narrative of women loudly and proudly owning their sexuality. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.

In 2010, Urban Outfitters published a picture of an already tiny model in a slouchy v-neck emblazoned with the phrase </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/09/15/how-urban-outfitters-trades-on-moral-outrage/?utm_term=.b9282110ad07\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“eat less”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have since been embroiled in </span><a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/480961/15-urban-outfitters-controversies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several scandals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involving accusations of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and downright theft. Free People has additionally been accused of </span><a href=\"https://www.today.com/style/free-people-accused-appropriating-native-american-culture-festival-line-t85821\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appropriating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Native American culture for festival lines. When major clothing companies don’t care about being socially, culturally or racially sensitive, why would they suddenly flip the script and support what has been a sexual taboo for generations? They’re simply just looking to turn a profit.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban’s long and arduous list of scandals in juxtaposition with its sudden jump to selling vibrators, lube, whips and other bedroom-related products reeks of performative wokeness. Why would a company so notoriously nonchalant about apologizing for wrongdoings care about anything beyond their brand’s profit? When searching for products concerning one of the most intimate facets of a woman’s life, it seems illogical and counterproductive to patronize a brand that values business over people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a whole host of feminist companies that have been in the business of supporting female sexuality long before big companies sought out to capitalize on the “trend” of female pleasure. </span><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Vibrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been a trailblazer in the industry, operating since 1977. </span><a href=\"https://www.babeland.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babeland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has been around since 1993, is wholeheartedly committed to sex education and community involvement.

Those in search of DIY orgasms would have to drive to a sex shop situated in a strip mall on the opposite side of town and peruse the aisles with eyes averted from the other customers, paying cash at the register to avoid a paper trail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, all that shame and secrecy has flown out the window. Just this past year, millions of fed-up women </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weaponized a single hashtag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rewrite the rules of a convoluted sexual landscape. Buzz words like “empowerment” and “sex-positivity” represent the current iteration of feminism to which millennials subscribe. The feminists of 2019 sport “Pussy Power” buttons on their backpacks. They skip brunch to attend women’s marches. They open up about their sexuality not only to their closest friends but to their Twitter feeds as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they shop for sex toys not in a dimly lit hole in the wall, but in the wide-open, colorful paradise of Urban Outfitters. Thanks to this mainstream retail outlet and its new collection of </span><a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/self-love-products\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“self-love” products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, female pleasure is just as accessible as a ’90s-inspired slip dress or a coffee table book of dad jokes. Featuring items such as bath bombs, “sex dust” (whatever that means) and emoji-shaped vibrators, the line advances an indulgent, pleasure-centered understanding of sexuality that “empowered” women are demanding in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though these products may not be direct political statements, their arrival in the midst of a feminist revolution is no coincidence. Urban Outfitters is just one name in a long list of companies that have capitalized on hot-button social issues in recent years. Through ad campaigns like Gillette’s “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Men Can Be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and Nike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomlpJREDzw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Kaepernick commercial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, brands have attempted to align themselves with the political sensibilities of their consumers. Many of these campaigns have received backlash from news and social media critics who believe corporations should not be hailed as trailblazers of activism for nominally supporting social causes in order to sell razors or basketball shorts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true that brands are profit-driven and don’t always follow their activist lip service with donations to causes or specific calls to action. These criticisms carry heavy weight at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with our country’s Machiavellian, profit-driven economic system. Among 18 to 29-year-olds — the demographic to which Urban Outfitters caters — </span><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approval ratings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of capitalism have plummeted by 23 percent in the past eight years.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as much as we hate the system, we must acknowledge that companies are meeting disillusioned shoppers in the middle by infusing a much-desired sense of meaning into the matrix of material consumption. According to a </span><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/championing-change-in-the-age-of-social-media/#Key-Findings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two-thirds of Americans believe it’s “important for brands to take public stands on social and political issues.” Right now, consumers are demanding more than just products; they hope to spend their hard-earned money on symbolic representations of their deeply held beliefs. Gillette no longer sells razors; they sell a positive and healthy form of masculinity. Nike no longer sells sneakers and basketball shorts; they sell a bold commitment to racial equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality. Yes, this statement is undoubtedly motivated by profit. But it is a statement nonetheless, and a positive one at that. The </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of masturbation are numerous; the activity is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality and improve body image, just to name a few.

On the other end of the spectrum, four girls had more than 30 partners and experienced orgasm less than 10 percent of the time (1-3 of their partners).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here’s more science to back me up. In the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Survey_of_Sexual_Health_and_Behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than 1000 adults were asked about their most recent sexual experience, and the results showed that 91 percent of the men climaxed during their encounter, compared to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only 62 percent of women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So is climaxing all that important during for women during sex? I asked the focus group, “Is orgasm necessary for you to consider a sexual experience good?” Most of their answers: No. “It’s fun and exciting for me to be intimate in general. I don’t have to reach an orgasm to enjoy the sex,” one participant explained. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is fine!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let’s compare this to how important it is for men to finish. If a guy doesn’t climax during sex, women often feel guilty. A lack of a male orgasm may be perceived as something being “wrong” with you or him.
