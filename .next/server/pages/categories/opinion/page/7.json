Senate should not divest from Israel. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tomorrow, the Associated Students Senate at UCSB will vote on a proposed resolution to divest from companies that have ties to Israel. This resolution is part of the broader Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. BDS is an international movement that seeks to destroy, defame, and delegitimize the only Jewish state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone whose parents found a home in Israel after fleeing religious persecution during the Iranian Revolution, I feel directly targeted by this resolution. My family’s experience does not stand alone. Many Jewish Israelis are people of color who came from Middle Eastern countries where their families faced persecution and discrimination, and Israel was the only place where they could find refuge. The descendants of these refugees make up the vibrant and diverse society that is Israel. For us, Israel is a safe haven and the embodiment of our liberation. This resolution attempts to erase this history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I, like many supporters of Israel, believe there is room to criticize the state. In fact, it is open criticism of Israel that makes it stronger and a true democracy. There are legitimate ways to criticize Israel, and there are ways to express these criticisms without erasing my people’s narrative and history. This resolution is not that way.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of advancing a one-sided resolution, we should be supporting initiatives that promote a better life for Palestinians and Israelis. Instead of divesting, we should be investing in collaboration and coexistence. Instead of dictating a political solution to a faraway conflict, we should be coming together to bridge our gaps and better understand one another here at UCSB. This resolution impedes progress towards justice and the goal of peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. It promotes a dangerous pattern that divides our campus, stifles dialogue, and creates a hostile atmosphere at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, as students at such a highly esteemed university, have the power to enact real and important change. It is dangerous and morally irresponsible, however, to pass a resolution that erases a whole group of people’s narrative and history. I urge you to do your research and understand all sides of this issue. I urge ASUCSB and my fellow Gauchos to come together with open minds and find a more productive way forward.</span></p>\n<p><i>Sarah Mehrnia encourages the 69th Senate not to divest from Israel.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/","id":5711,"author":{"id":385,"name":"Sarah Mehrnia"},"related":[5710,5709,5708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ask AJ: The Love Doctor Is In","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Ask AJ","publish_date":"2019-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?resize=650%2C488&ssl=1","description":"AJ prescribes advice to a couple o' lovesick Gauchos.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_86187\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86187\" data-attachment-id=\"86187\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/ask-aj-love-on-the-brain/image_6483441-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ask aj\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86187\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image_6483441-e1550111766375.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86187\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What’s the best way to navigate the hookup culture at UCSB/in I.V.?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving my acceptance letter to UCSB, my friends promptly joked about the rumored strand of chlamydia that was both well-circulated and unique to UCSB.

That is why it is important to remember that despite “norms” or assumed expectations, at the end of the day any level of intimacy must be on the terms of your partner and you. Figure out what you want out of a relationship. That could be anything from knowing you want to get married and have five kids after dating six months to knowing you exclusively want to have one-night stands. Defining for yourself what you want will help you avoid a potentially negative or even harmful situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the physicality of hooking up, make sure you know your boundaries, what you are comfortable with and what you are willing to try, and be sure to have communicated with your partner about their boundaries as well. Remember that while hookup culture on a college campus can be uniquely lecherous, it can also be surprisingly insightful. Keeping open lines of communication can not only help keep you safe, but it can also allow you to more comfortably explore your sexual boundaries as well.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do I stay faithful to my long-distance boyfriend? It’s so hard sometimes!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe everyone is capable of maintaining a long-distance relationship, I do not believe long-distance relationships are for everyone, for a variety of different reasons. That being said, I believe the first step to being faithful in a long-distance relationship is ensuring that both your partner and you are 100 percent committed to the relationship as it is. Relationships in and of themselves are difficult, and being physically separated only adds to the opportunities for confusion, miscommunication and stress. If both of you are not committed to one another and to addressing your issues as they arise, I don’t believe it would be worth it to stay together because you will just be hurting one another in the long run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you and your boyfriend have discussed your commitment to one another, I think it would be beneficial to set aside a few times a week when you will Facetime or have a phone call with each other. Obviously you can talk more than what is scheduled, but ensuring that you have dedicated time to each other regularly is a more tangible representation of your commitment that will help you both stay connected. I also think that it is important for your partner and you to discuss how you will handle conflict when it arises. Whether you decide to address it immediately or to give yourselves a few days before discussing, putting a concrete plan in place will help you avoid simply putting issues off that could be detrimental to the relationship. Long-distance relationships may be the ultimate test of a relationship, but keep in mind why you’re staying committed and that the distance is only temporary.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ – how do I tell my best friend I’ve been in love with her for five years? I don’t think I can stay silent anymore :(</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling in love with your best friend to some extent seems almost inevitable. Despite all efforts to maintain a completely platonic relationship, the lines of intimacy blur when you love someone. She knows you love her, but she doesn’t know the way you love her. You have to be completely honest with her and also with yourself. What is it that you want from the relationship and what are your intentions in telling her? While I do believe you should be honest with her about your feelings, that does not necessarily mean that you have the intention of changing the relationship right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When friendship turns into something more, I think there is always the fear of losing the relationship. Keep in mind that this may catch her off-guard or she may not even skip a beat. Regardless, you should let her know that you care about her and that you want to communicate about how the feelings may affect your relationship.

He thrived on cultural trivia, arguments for the sake of debate and, most of all, plucky banter with his friends. After attending grad school at Georgetown, Steve traveled the world, bouncing from destination to destination, only to land at his final stop in Isla Vista. He had always been focused academically on math and science, but once he moved to I.V., he blossomed into the artsy-fartsy, free-spirited philosopher we all came to love. Then, with a few good friends and a strong peer group at his side, Steve opened a coffee shop called the Coffee Collaborative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Collab, as it was fondly addressed, was an offbeat and quirky shop on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero. Never having been much of a businessman, Steve ignored traditional corporate tactics and, instead, transformed the Collab into a creative, alternative space. Although it didn’t seem exceptional to some, it was everything to its employees, regulars, locals and passersby. This became the home of debates, late-night talks, laughter, chess and community. It also became, perhaps infamously, a refuge for the lost, alcoholic, homeless and the poor. Regardless of how it was perceived from the outside, the Collab was always a place of belonging and forgiveness and was never a place for judgement — that was all Steve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might even say that Steve was the purveyor of wayward souls. Perhaps he was so accepting of others because he, at heart, was a lost soul too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve was certainly not a hero, but he touched the lives of many young people; he spurred intellectual conflict, wafted at the edges of his beliefs and challenged those around him to do the same. Aside from being a philosopher, he was also an absurd comic and a wild storyteller. And although he was plagued by darkness, you’d never know it at the sound of his distinctive and well-loved laugh; it had a depth to it, came straight from the belly and would make you laugh along with him just at the sound of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like The Dude from “The Big Lebowski,” Steve always seemed to be caught up in some new fantasy or adventure. However aimless he seemed, his life was never dull and he was always able to find some sort of trouble or mischief.

The oil wells would use the “steam fracking” method which relies heavily on vast amounts of water and natural gas. To supply this gas, new pipelines would have to be constructed along highways 101 and 135. The oil wells would use the gas to heat the water to steam in order to loosen the thick crude oil from the ground. This process requires an estimated seven to eight million gallons of freshwater. Amidst California’s ever-present specter of drought, it does not have the freshwater resources nor the appetite for risk to follow through with such a commitment.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, this oil scheme threatens the ecological health and air quality of Santa Barbara County’s ecosystems. <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">Aera Energy’s project</a> alone would require bulldozing 300 acres of land, moving three million cubic feet of earth and uprooting 1,500 oak trees. This would destroy the habitats and even lives of animals and plants, hurting our precious ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On top of these disastrous changes, the mere functioning of these oil wells would increase the amount of fossil fuel pollutants into the air. The wells generate high amounts of particulate matter, specifically toxic hydrogen sulfide. Also, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">the proposal would bring an additional 156 oil tanker trips per day</a> to local roadways, polluting more carbon emission gases.  Finally, the oil production process involves toxic chemicals, including benzene, toluene, xylene and many others, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">which can impact hormone production and cause cancer and birth defects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most insidious danger of this plan is the certainty of an oil spill. Spills are not just possible but expected. The Environmental Impact Reports for the wells anticipate spills from both wells and pipelines. As of 2017, there were as many as <a href=\"http://www.sbcan.org/issues_maps\">60 active investigations</a> of petroleum contamination being conducted by Sisquoc and Guadalupe. ERG itself estimates <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">18 spills over the next 10 years</a>. This estimation echoes the company’s track record, having been responsible for 21 oil spills between 2011 and 2015, resulting in over <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">20,000 gallons of spilled crude</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These <a href=\"http://350sb.org/no-new-oil-wells/\">spills will endanger the Santa Maria Valley Groundwater Basin</a>, the major source of freshwater for 200,000 people in 12 cities, including Santa Maria, Orcutt and Guadalupe. The most glaring threat of this project is that it will be constructed just 1,900 feet, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">less than a mile, from Benjamin Foxen Elementary School</a> in Sisquoc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While oil construction projects are usually framed as creating jobs, the cost of oil and contaminant cleanup can be prodigious. The most recent of the catastrophic oil spills took place only a few years ago in 2015. The Refugio Oil Spill cost taxpayers about $100 million in clean up. Taxpayers and the local community bear the burden of paying the additional damage to ecosystems, loss of animal and plant life and closures of recreational areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One would think that Santa Barbara would know better about increasing the presence and of oil corporations; only 50 years ago, our county suffered the disastrous and infamous 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill. This calamity brought our community together in tackling the influence of oil companies in our democratic institutions. From this low point, the people of Santa Barbara sparked the epicenter of the modern environmentalist movement, which has only benefited our country with environmental health and sustainable economic growth. It is important to recall this history in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. We stand with our fellow residents and organizations that oppose this empty and dangerous project. The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.<br><br><em>Students interested in these ongoing efforts can email </em>gmhahn@ucsb.edu<em> or </em>alealsilva@ucsb.edu <em>for more information on how to get involved in the ongoing efforts against the Cat Canyon proposal.</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/","id":5712,"author":{"id":382,"name":"Gordon Hahn"},"related":[5711,5710,5709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ask AJ: Pitching Your Roommate and Hitting for Both Teams","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Ask AJ","publish_date":"2019-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ask-aj.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ask-aj.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Is your roommate listening to porn too loudly?

How do I get him to stop?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp… I’m going to have to say there is no way to stop your roommate from watching copious amounts of porn; however, the noise pollution is definitely something that is more up for discussion. If by some miniscule chance your roommate is living in a state of oblivion and consequently unaware of the fact that you know he’s watching porn, then I would say you should let him know you are VERY aware of that fact. The oblivious roommate, while sometimes annoying, will often change their behavior once they’re told their actions are disturbing the peace of others, within a reasonable amount that is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, however, your roommate is shamelessly aware of the fact that all of Isla Vista knows he’s spanking the monkey — *insert favorite masturbation euphemism* — then you’ll probably have to address this issue from the position of a roommate and not a friend (assuming you two are friends). While I am one to support most (nearly all) expressions of physical exploration and desire, and I think it’s important to respect the expressions of others, the shared space must be respected first. Whether he masturbates once a day or his hand never leaves his pants, if he’s making a noticeable amount of noise, you can tell him that you find it bothersome. If a roommate were playing music too loudly, most people wouldn’t hesitate to ask them to turn it down. While this situation is slightly more sensitive, I would venture to say your roommate may understand how you could be uncomfortable. The bottom line is that you guys should set boundaries and expectations, whether that is him reducing his noise level or even you leaving your schedule so he knows when he can be loud. At the very least, he owes you some high-quality ear plugs.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p><b>How do I come out as bisexual?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have to preface this answer, like many others, with transparency about my identity and experiences. As a cis-gendered, heterosexual female the scope of my knowledge is limited to my observations, interactions, and what I have read. That being said, there are still many facets of sexuality that I have yet to even begin thinking about let alone try to understand, but I hope that in questioning my own perceptions and learning about others’ experiences I can find some ground of understanding and explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though in hindsight it seems so apparent, it wasn’t until it was pointed out to me that I understood there is not a *right* way to come out. The subjectivity of the answers to questions I had asked myself in thinking about sexuality necessitates a solution that could not possibly be singular. For me, this begs the question of where validity and acceptance of different sexualities lies in our community as well as in other aspects of your life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world has critiqued us endlessly as cultures within communities perpetuate both overt and more subtle forms of prejudice, and each identity has faced the consequences. The denial and erasure of bisexuality has in many ways affected individuals’ willingness to come out. Whether or not your family, friends, and peers are accepting, questioning and denial are often times at the forefront of discussion: “Are you sure you’re not just confused?,” “You’re a girl dating a man but you identify as bi? Does that identity even affect you?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember you are coming out for you and nobody else. You know that your sexuality is valid, and your feelings are real. There will be people that won’t support you but find strength and compassion with the ones who do and develop a support system with them. Coming out will be a process and you will probably find yourself coming out several times because your sexuality isn’t determined by the gender of your partner. In talking with your partners, it is always important to keep open lines of communication. Eventually, you may become more and more familiar with how certain reactions make you feel and it is important to discuss and process those feelings in each new relationship because they may vary from person to person. At times this process will wear on you, but always remember you can do this and you are not alone.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

It was Labor Day; we were in a cabin at Tahoe. I was unprepared, it was premature and yes, I bled. That weekend in sixth grade, I became the first of my friends to get my period. At a scrappy Chevron on the way home, my friend’s mom Lisa taught me how to put a pad on my underwear.<br><br>“Then you fold the wings down,” she yelled at me through the cracks of the public restroom. She paused, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “And you’ll <em>feel</em> it when it comes out.” <br><br>It sounded almost pleasurable, the prurient way she said it. I had dozed off during our barebones sex ed class in fifth grade, so upon first seeing those unfamiliar red spots on my ash-white shorts, my imagination ran rampant. I envisioned a sort of magical oil slick oozing neatly into a sanitary pad, to be expected and practiced as an annual fertility rite of womanhood. I surmised that it would happen twice a year, tops, probably aligning with the cosmic patterns of celestial orbs. There was probably a farmer’s almanac I could borrow at the middle school library to help me predict my period next year. Then, I learned that I come from a long line of uteruses that expel blood with the urgency of a firefighter’s hose. I adopted my mother’s many strategies: mesh underwear, double lining pads, sleepless nights on top of the dark towel. <br><br>That summer, my mom and I went on an impromptu European mother-daughter trip. In Rome, during a free Mozart opera concert that bored me to no end, my mom’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. She did not break her gaze from the warbling singers. “Aiya,” she said calmly. “The disaster has come.” I panicked for her. No, she said, she didn’t have any hygienic provisions with her. No, she didn’t have any black pants to change into. Yes, she had bled through. I looked at her khaki trousers that had seemed so smart and graceful moments earlier, and cursed them for her. We conspired to leave the concert with quick paces, me walking mere inches behind her like a sticky shadow.<br><br>Companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (which owns Always, Tampax, Naturella, and Whisper) target women of different countries with different products. The French want the least bulky, the Japanese want the softest material, and Americans want maximum security against leakage, regardless of cost in comfort. When we neared the light of street lamps, I could see the little stains on either side of her crotch, hiding in the creases of her pants as she walked, like a blinking, winking, eyebrow-raising face that mocked our embarrassment. Did the Italianos around us notice? Would they stand and point and laugh at her if they saw her stains? What if we were walking under American streetlights?<br><br>Menstruation is an ongoing civil war waged in between my legs, my ruined underwear its tired battlefield. Month after month, my body triumphantly declares victory over my will. I looked towards a higher power. What could calm the fury that overtook my body every 28 days? God, maybe, or yoga? I dabbled in both to no avail. My pediatrician warily prescribed me birth control and I started Sprintec, a waxy blue envelope of little round pills which is now my constant companion. Sometimes, when I forget to pepper the pill at precisely 9 p.m., I have my period for two straight months. I envied the women whose periods are so infrequent that they buy pregnancy tests. I envied Olympic gymnasts, whose extreme athleticism causes secondary amenorrhea. I envied those without uteruses and I resented their oblivion to our suffering. <br><br>I grew to dread my period, a deep self-hatred dappled with anxiety from frantically shuffling towards the bathroom with a hidden tampon up my sleeve or subtly glancing at my seat every time I stood up. Periods were terrible to start at school. By lunchtime, I’d convene with my friends. “I bled through,” I’d say glumly, defeated yet again. In a practiced ritual, they’d pat me on the shoulder with a sympathetic look. Lisa was right. I felt it. I felt too dirty to exist in public when I was bleeding. <br><br>We bargain with our reflections in the mirror, playing with the cards we were dealt: the cleft chin from your father, the curly hair from your mother, the hooded eyes, the pixie ears, the color of your skin in the winter. Variances of periods are many: menstruation can begin as early as age eight, lasts from two to seven days per cycle and occurs every 21 to 45 days. Periods can be viscous or thin, staining your favorite clothes any shade of crimson and brown. Thus, the period is the last manifestation of this genetic destiny, a hormonal sorting hat declaring your birth-given menstrual fate. As I anticipate the monthly shedding of my uterine lining, I’m reminded of my biological duty to reproduce, my position as almost-mother and future-mother and, at the risk of empathizing with the pro-life movement, my body’s power to create conscious life. No joy can be derived from apologizing for bleeding, sorry after sorry to my light-wash Levi’s and my Advil-scarred stomach. We do not shame the injured for their gushing wounds and broken bones, yet as I’m hurt, month after month, I nurse myself in secrecy. Menstruation is a woman’s first introduction to labor needlessly for the comfort of others.<br><br>When I was 17, I got a Diva Cup. The silicone wonder arrived at my door in a purple box with curlicue writing urging me to join the revolution: “A Better Period Experience,” it promised. The instructions are written in exquisite detail, specifying the locations of the labia and the cervix, as if its user did not know what a vagina is; the Diva Cup knew that many women are strangers to the intricate pains and pleasures of their own bodies. There was no shame in not knowing yet. Holding it by its ribbed stem, the cup is roughly tulip-sized and supple to the touch. Instructions demand some origami first: fold the cup in half from top down or into a U-shape. Then, a choreographed tango: angle the pelvis to the cup in sitting position as you insert, rotating it to ensure a solid seal. If vaginas were capable of feeling anxiety, mine did. As I pushed the Diva Cup in for its maiden voyage, I feared the worst. It might get swallowed up in that orifice and I might have to ask my mom to take me to the ER. It could crumble inside my vagina and probably somehow enter my bloodstream. The cup might turn over, liberating a deluge of blood in the middle of my Russian Literature seminar. It might hurt. Silly doubts, I realize now. The cup felt like nothing and my first period with the Diva Cup was a fucking miracle. Either God or yoga took pity on me; I was no longer drowning in a pool of my own blood and shame.<br><br>Oh, how can I count the ways I love thee, Diva Cup? Besides the physical security in its flawless, ingenious function, the cup is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, safe, comfortable, and convenient alternative. Am I a hormonal Diva for my unorthodox approach to reigning in my menstrual flow? Or is this cup the Diva that translates the dramatic theatre of my cycle to a secret power? I perused their website. “The name Diva originates in Italy, where it was used to describe a female deity, a powerful woman whose talent resembles that of the gods. In the 1800s the name Diva was used to describe a talented woman, leading the way in music and stage.

How could I pronounce myself a proud Jew if I couldn’t read Hebrew and didn’t even believe in God? I struggled to fit in with the image of Judaism depicted by my family. They lived a stereotypically fast-paced East Coast life filled with big family gatherings, rude but adoring arguments and intense political debates. By contrast, our small four-person family unit was the sole Ziment representative in California. We lived an easy-going life filled with days at the beach quietly reading books and nights spent with the four of us on the couch watching American Idol. Though I desperately wanted to embody my extended family’s rendering of our culture, I couldn’t pretend that our lives were similar in the slightest.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I got older and life got crazier, we started visiting the city less and less.

Up until this point, the only definition of consent that I had ever heard was always “no means no.” Every conversation about consent seemed to end with this succinct summation.  But as a teenager navigating the complicated process of growing up, I learned that saying “no” is a lot easier said than done. A “no” does not always look or sound like someone simply saying “no.” Sometimes a “no” is silence. Sometimes a “no” is fear. Sometimes a “no” is a series of no’s that ended with a “fine.” I knew what consent was, but it was still hard to know whether or not I was truly giving it, because while I wasn’t saying no, I wasn’t exactly saying “yes” either. What I learned that day in class was that consent isn’t about saying “no,” it’s about saying “yes.” That day had a huge impact on how I view consent even now. And while I was so grateful to have had that education, I couldn’t help but wonder, what took so long? </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86872\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86872\" data-attachment-id=\"86872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/consent-lauren-orris/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=1660%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1660,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"consent : lauren orris\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86872\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris-203x250.jpg?resize=332%2C409\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=768%2C948&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?w=1660&amp;ssl=1 1660w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lauren Orris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, there hasn’t been much legislation surrounding consent. Federally, rape is illegal, and rape is defined as penetration without the consent of the victim. So while we have a definition of rape, we also need a definition of consent. This is where it gets dicey. Consent is defined differently in every U.S. state, but overall, each definition can be summed up as “no means no.” This changed in California in 2014 when </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill No. 967</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (codified as Section 67386 of the California Education Code) was signed into law. This law requires public schools to adopt policies and develop curriculum around affirmative consent in order to receive state funding. It’s affirmative: this law changed the definition of consent. Without affirmative consent there is pressure on the victim to resist, but sex should never involve resistance. The idea is that if someone wants to have sex, they will tell you, and before that happens, keep your hands to yourself. Consent is not the absence of a “no,” but the presence of a “yes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That brings us back to my senior year in a California public high school, and finally feeling like I just might understand what it means to actually say “yes.” But I don’t think we should wait until kids are having sex to talk to them about consent. Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk. Deciding who can touch your body and how does not always have to do with sex—it has do with choice and respect. Consent is not inherently sexual, and we have to stop treating it like it is. If consent was something we taught as early as pre-school, maybe kids would grow up into adults who understand what it means to ask for and to give consent. Luckily, some schools in the United States are doing just that. At </span><a href=\"http://www.lone-tree.k12.ia.us/video\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lone Tree Elementary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Iowa, they teach students consent in one of the simplest of ways: saying hello. Every morning the pre-schoolers greet each other and the kids may choose between a hug, a handshake, a high five, or a fistbump. This practice was originally put in place to encourage positive interactions between the students, but on a larger scale it teaches children to not only seek permission before touching someone, but also that it is okay to be explicit about what they want for themselves as well, even if it’s only the difference between a hug or a handshake. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem intuitive to establish consent between peers or strangers, I’d like to take it a step further and argue that it should be established between family members as well. It is often expected that young children hug or kiss grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. Of course, I think this is wonderful, but it is not uncommon for young children to resist or be uncomfortable with forced contact. I was certainly a stubborn child once who didn’t want to kiss my relatives, but eventually, I learned it was something that you just have to do, even if you don’t always want to. But by forcing even these most innocent interactions, it teaches children that they should do what is asked of them and their bodies, even if it makes them uncomfortable. It’s an act of assumption and it teaches a code of putting other people’s desires before your own. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that kids should never be encouraged to show physical affection to family members, but I am saying that even the small act of asking for consent (and respecting the answer) before hugging a child could have a long-term impact in teaching them what consent looks and feels like.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk. Deciding who can touch your body and how does not always have to do with sex—it has do with choice and respect. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now more than ever consent is finally a topic of conversation. With movements like </span><a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeToo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is a long overdue dialogue starting about what it means to truly say “yes.” I want to take it further and make it a conversation that isn’t just about sex, and isn’t just for teenagers and college students. Growing up, I found consent complicated, but it shouldn’t be. Perhaps if we grow up learning to respect one another and ourselves—by seeing and practicing affirmative consent in all facets of touch—then “yes means yes” could just be common sense and decency, rather than a complicated piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/college-sexual-assault\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will experience sexual assault in college. Based on the women I know in college, that number is much higher. This number only represents those who report, but think about how many don’t. For their own reasons—whether it’s fear, embarrassment, or not even realizing they were assaulted in the first place—so many stay silent. I have left sexual interactions feeling ashamed or hurt, but I couldn’t understand why. I never said no, after all. Sometimes it takes time (and really good friends) to recognize sexual assault when it happens, and that’s why we need to talk about it.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent wasn’t really a conversation in my life until late into high school, and even then, it was always in classes, and certainly never anything that was talked about within my family. It’s time to start having these conversations, because no one should ever touch or be touched without consent, and only “yes” can mean “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juliet Carter wants to talk about consent.  </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/","id":6386,"author":{"id":780,"name":"Juliet Carter"},"related":[6385,6384,6383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Group or Individual Therapy — It Depends On You!","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-03-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/caps-ps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/caps-ps.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jasmine Feng details her experiences with individual and group therapy and issues an important reminder that it does get better.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smell of the eucalyptus aromatherapy candle drifts through the office, engulfing me as I take deep breaths and wait.

This is the only correct answer; I never have an alternative. I am conditioned to this detachment from my own emotions and find it even harder to express vulnerability in the face of a supposed professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My appointment consists of fluff: surface-level talk about my family, studies and extracurricular activities dominates the conversation. When it concludes, my therapist inquires if I have any interest in group therapy. He explains that I would forfeit the opportunity of having one-on-one appointments with a therapist, but the support that group therapy will provide is so monumental it should outweigh any doubts I have about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/division/div49\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, group therapy “involves one or more psychologists who lead a group of roughly five up to fifteen patients.” It usually addresses some sort of problem such as shyness, loneliness, anxiety and social anxiety (although I find it slightly ironic having to discuss your social anxiety in front of a large group of people). </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/group-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Ben Johnson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a member of the American Psychological Association, claims that there are a multitude of benefits worth reaping from group therapy, such as support, guidance of a professional and empathy from those who share similar experiences. At first glance, it seems like group therapy might work. In theory, it has potential: You can listen to people who undergo similar issues and find ways to apply other perspectives to your problems, gain a sense of inclusivity and grow more self-aware. If you’ve been in a difficult mental place before, you might find it helpful to attend and possibly learn better coping mechanisms from a professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is impractical to say that the advantages of group therapy apply to everyone, especially since it demands complete openness to strangers who may breach confidentiality. Participants must express sheer transparency about their personal lives to more than five people they may not know, much less trust. The American Mental Health Foundation states that it proves even more difficult in situations in which members are in crises or are suicidal, as “it is necessary to function with a degree of normalcy.”  Yet, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, there are</span><a href=\"https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 16 million people </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the world diagnosed with depression, a common precursor to having suicidal thoughts, and a myriad of them attend group therapy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, individual therapy is also an option. The American Psychological Association claims that individual therapy is successful due to high confidentiality, therapeutic alliance and an individualized approach to treatment. Confidentiality is not easily breached in such a private environment, which could prove useful to elevate a patient’s sense of safety. An elevated sense of safety could consequently promote a therapeutic alliance, allowing more bonding between both therapist and client to encourage the client to share more aspects of his or her life. Such therapeutic alliance can also assist a therapist in formulating plans to cater toward an individual’s needs and pace. However, the success rate of individualized therapy is highly contingent on a client’s willingness to open up and the therapist’s willingness to listen and provide constructive insight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I personally attended both group and individual therapy sessions, I found none of my therapists to be a good fit. For a while, I thought maybe I was just too difficult to understand or that my situation was too complicated for an outsider to make a coherent judgement. So I began doing other things that helped me cope: I returned to my beginnings and slowly picked up my old hobbies again. Before my downward spiral began, music and writing were both huge components of my life. Motivating myself to be productive with the things I loved was difficult, but in the long run, it was an effective step in the right direction. In fact, the American Psychological Association </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compiled a number of studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which suggested a positive correlation between music and promoted recovery of depression or stress. With this in mind, alternative options to talk therapy should be considered for those who do not find words the most accessible form of expression. Art, music and even online therapies are all possibilities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it. But there are people out there who want to help you, and although I found utilizing therapists ineffective, this does not mean you will. It does get better, and you will eventually find peace once you try healing methods tailored to you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time C.A.P.S. suggests group therapy or asks if you’d like to continue your current sessions, think twice about what works for you. Options at a university are limited, but there are a multitude of outside resources in the real world that could potentially benefit you. It is difficult to know what works without trying a vast range of therapies, but once you find the right method, I hope you can say “I’m good” and mean it. The road to recovery is a long one, but there are no speed limits. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Feng thinks that everyone has an individualized approach to therapy and

a suitcase of fancy baby formula </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m picking her baby’s English name. The gravity of this responsibility slicks my palms with sweat whenever it crosses my mind. When parents name their newborns, it is more of a prayer than a name. There’s nothing about a bald mound of fat rolls that says “Paul” or “Beatrice,” yet there’s so much hope that the child will amount to a specific vision of greatness. A baby named Clayton has the potential to become a coked-out Wall Street asshole; a baby named Tallulah could be a raw vegan vlogger based in Portland. But naming your baby Beckham does not predestine her soccer career. The associations we have with names seem arbitrary, but they guide us in evaluating the people we meet. Names carry legacy and heritage, and they are more than a first impression for one individual: they are continuations. They are brands. Every Donald suffers from the reputation of one bad Donald.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The associations we have with names seem arbitrary, but they guide us in evaluating the people we meet.

Most likely, you see yourself as a body swimming with thoughts, emotions and ambitions. Maybe you identify yourself first by your talents, vocations or values: as a climber, a musician, as a communist. It’s difficult to summarize and identify individuality and connect the body that speaks and moves to the person inside. Names are meant to identify and summarize you but ultimately fail to satisfy either role. They’re tenuous ties to someone who you could potentially be and people before you who fulfilled their role under your name. There’s little ownership in being named, little choice in your first introduction to every stranger and every unknown territory. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Names can alienate you too. They can be false prophets. For many trans people, birth names become deadnames. Just think: we didn’t always introduce ourselves with preferred pronouns. I distinctly remember the moment in high school when we began our class by reintroducing ourselves with pronouns to the people we had grown up with. It felt odd at first, entering this ritual so bare and true. What used to be intimate confessions became declarations. It was a terrifying comfort; we held our breath as one, passing it around the room, as each of us entered the space as pretend-strangers. It was an opportunity to reenter the known realms of our world and it reminded me of Harvey Milk shouting at all of us to come out of the closet. To tell our neighbors that their grocer is queer, that their children are queer, that their friends are queer. Milk politicized coming out: it was powerful, he implied, for the greater good of our community. Maybe you still live in your deadname; it is not anyone’s place to tell you to come out. It is a privilege to understand identity; it is a greater privilege to perform your truth in the total safety of your reality. But in my English seminar, at age 17, I attended my friends’ self-christenings. I don’t claim that announcing our preferred pronouns made queerness definitively easier, but some of us were practicing for Harvey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was named by my mother’s MBA professor’s daughter, who was fourteen and apparently named me after a cinematic Catherine. The jury is still out on if it was Zeta-Jones or Deneuve, but I hope my mom got a good grade in that class. Katherine is a high-maintenance name for divas: Catherine the Great, Katharine Hepburn, Katherine Heigl. Strangers expect applause if they spell it correctly. The Chinese name my mother chose for my legal middle name came from the ancient Chinese classic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spring Autumn Annals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A monk told my aunt I would get into a car crash if I didn’t informally change my name to one with more “fire” in it, so I spent an hour with a Chinese dictionary just so the girls at my middle school could tell me it sounded like “shampoo.” It’s 炫如 (XuànRú), by the way. So much for radical female friendship. My family never called me anything other than “baobao” (Chinese for “treasure”) unless they were royally pissed. I only heard “Katherine” when I was being yelled at in a car. By high school, I started going by “Kat” because I was so triggered by “Katherine,” which I still deeply associate with my mom’s unbridled anger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, we shouldn’t have names until we’re 20. By then, anyone obtuse enough to choose a name like Tampon (a moment of silence for Bella Thorne’s dog) are willing participants in natural selection. But adopting a new name so late in life split me in two: the Katherine before, the Kat after. Coupled with the spice of teenage rebellion, I could not distinguish my growth from my identity crisis. How do celebrities do it? Anna Nicole Smith was Vicky, Guy was Ferry before Fieri, Chef Boyardee was handsomely named Ettore Boiardi (yes, I have a crush on Chef Boyardee). When these famous household names rebranded, were their names purely interchangeable costumes? We were all confused when Snoop announced his transition from canine to feline form, but maybe for him it felt like shedding skin, one era of iconicity to the next. Was reinvention an embodiment of their hopeful ascension to superstardom? Or maybe their name was a protective shield that separated their public performance from their private life, a shield that ricocheted the scrutiny of TMZ onto a exquisitely concocted character.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we name babies, we have so much hope for them: they have no criminal records, no failing grades, no experience with abusive boyfriends.

We want the world to know so desperately that they are special to the people who love them. In a perfect world, people will call me baby, just like the way my mom calls me “baobao.” I want to feel swaddled by strangers when they address me, like a walking, talking ricotta blintz. Baby is not only gender neutral </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it radiates warmth reminiscent of sick days spent drinking soup in my childhood bedroom and plastering Doraemon stickers on my mirror. I want to be called baby until I’m ready to bear the burden of a name. I miss the vulnerability of not recognizing my name in writing before I learned to read. I miss living life without the identifier that was pinned to me at birth. Most of all, baby is a reminder that my name is not a reflection of my corporeal form and all of the wonderful thoughts and abilities you can’t see. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the universal nature of “baby” is a comforting reminder that I am, even at my most beloved state, not special. So many mothers on falling moons cooing at their sleepless babies. So many lovers on rising suns sending their babies good morning texts laden with pink emojis. All of these babies, adored and numbed, daydreaming about finding home in their person. It’s a tired story, so generic it seems cheap, yet there’s solace in being one of many. When it happens for you, you’ll understand. “Ah!” you’ll think, caught off guard, “This is what it feels like to be someone’s prayer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that two-syllable moment, you embody all that is infinitely possible of a fresh newborn. I am someone’s baby, you are someone’s baby; someone will call me baby and someone should call you baby. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kat Chen will kick you in the shins if you call her “babe.”</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

boyfriend and I have been dating for about a month (we had been friends since the start of Fall Quarter). I have a feeling that he’s about to say “I love you” soon. He goes on long rants about things he loves about me but stops just short of saying “I love you.” Unfortunately, I don’t feel the same way. I think I could love him if I had more time, but I don’t want it to affect our relationship if I don’t say “I love you” back in that moment. Do I lie or tell the truth? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming to this point in a relationship is difficult when the feelings aren’t completely mutual especially when you’re anticipating unreciprocated feelings. There isn’t a strict timeline in terms of a relationship, but I would say that one month is a relatively short period of time to expect someone to be sure of love. I definitely don’t think you should tell him you love him until that is the way you feel, and I think lying to him would hurt him more than anything. But to that end you shouldn’t feel like you have a reason to lie. It is 100 percent okay not to be experiencing those feelings yet, the important thing to let him know is that you do really care about him and although you don’t love him, it isn’t a matter of your relationship but a matter of time. We all develop and experience feelings differently and there is no reason for him to be hurt that you don’t have the exact same timeline as him.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ – my boyfriend is trying to grow a beard, and it’s not looking too good. How do I tell him to shave it without coming across as too mean?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How invested in this beard is your boyfriend? I feel like once guys get to the age where they can grow a beard, patchy or not, it’s some semblance of manhood for them. Regardless you could just straight up tell him a beard is not the move. Some guys will be offended, but you could remind them it’s probably better for their wellbeing (and yours). If you think he’ll be really offended you could take the angle of telling him how good he looks clean shaven or with stubble. That way it’s not really negatively directed.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do I get my boyfriend to eat my ass? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating ass… that’s a tricky one. It’s definitely one of those things you’ve gotta go all in for. Personally, I think if you want your ass eaten, honesty is the best policy. I don’t think there is any way to subtly discuss this topic, not that you should discuss any aspect of your romantic relationships subtly. Because you are dating this person, I think it’s important for your boyfriend to know how much it’s something you want to explore because unless you’re in a polyamorous relationship, no one else but your boyfriend should be eating your ass. Also, give your boyfriend sometime to think it over. He may say no at first and then eventually come around to the idea after you talk about it some more. Don’t give up and keep that toosh clean!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p><b>Will you marry me?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take me on a date first and we’ll see.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I am having trouble finding a balance between going out and staying in. My friends go out five nights a week and I feel lame when I stay in (also #fomo) what should I do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely struggled with this when I came to college and I think a lot of students do as well. Personally, I think it is really important to establish what your priorities are. In the back of my mind I constantly remind myself why I came to college and that it is a privilege to be here. Academics are extremely important, and you have to really know yourself and what you need in order to feel successful. That being said, there is more to college than hitting the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many people, coming to college is the first time they truly have any sort of independence. To some extent, you could be doing whatever the hell you’d like. While that does sound a little extreme, it’s definitely something to take advantage of. Right now I would say your lifestyle and your body are at a point where they can handle the extremes. However, going out five nights a week really isn’t sustainable for many people. I think going out that much is something to try for a short period of time, but after awhile I do think you could get bored among other things. Also, FOMO is for sure real, but more likely than not when you go out you’ll be going to the same types of parties with the same people listening to the same music drinking the same shitty Vitali and that’s nothing to sweat over missing out on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going out is important, but like you’re saying, balance is key. I would pick two to three nights a week to go out on so you get your time to have fun, but also know you’ll be able to handle your workload. And always remember: TREAT YO SELF!</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

This concept is particularly prevalent for ethnically ambiguous men and women in the dating world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My junior year of high school was my first introduction to the strange world of dating while being ethnically ambiguous. I distinctly remember my friends telling me how some boys at our school referred to me as “the Indian Princess,” “Princess Jasmine” and “the exotic girl.” For context, these boys were white, lacrosse-playing, Vineyard Vine-wearing prep school students, while I was an introverted, part white, part South Asian, part East Asian 16-year-old girl. At the time, I was honestly pretty excited that boys were even talking about me, but I do recall telling my older sister about this situation, and her reaction was pure disgust.

In the moment, I definitely thought that the constant remarks and fascination with my confusing ethnic makeup was weird, but I wasn’t offended. Mildly creeped out, sure, but not insulted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming to UC Santa Barbara in the fall of 2017, I honestly believed that these misinformed but not necessarily malicious interactions about my ethnic ambiguity would not occur as frequently. I went to a private prep school that wasn’t particularly known for its diversity, and I was under the impression that Isla Vista was a kind of paradise with friendly students who were all busy surfing, smoking weed or, in the rare instance, studying. I did not expect to be inundated with boys whose main fixation of the evening was my unusual ethnic background. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be from frat parties, going on actual dates or even catcallers on DP, the amount of prying questions from boys about my ethnicity have been so prevalent, it’s almost comical. My friend told me I should start a Google Doc and document the funniest and most occurring unwarranted observations, and that Google Doc now has quite a few pages filled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Your looks intrigue me. You just look … different” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So what kind of girl are you? Besides exotic, of course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Damn, well I do have a thing for [fill in the blank of a fetishized minority] girls</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most awkward situations I’ve faced at UCSB transpired because of my ethnically ambiguous looks. During my freshman year, my friends and I had been out at a party and had decided to leave a little before 12 a.m. As we were walking down the sidewalk, a cop ordered us to stop on the corner of the street. Wide-eyed and panicking, my friends and I complied, and I remember legitimately praying that we wouldn’t get in trouble. But instead of asking us law-enforcement questions about where we had been or what we had been doing that night, the cop ignored all my friends and narrowed in on me and said, “You’re so exotic. Where are your parents from? You have very striking, beautiful looks.”</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling someone “exotic” is not a good pickup line. It reinforces the idea that non-Western cultures are far removed and unusual, and this idea can potentially cause identity confusion for mixed-race people because a part of their background may be from a Western culture as well. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was caught off guard by his comments but also so relieved that I wasn’t getting in trouble for anything. There was an obvious power dynamic that favored the cop in this situation, so I played along with him and good-naturedly answered his questions until my friends and I were able to walk away comfortably. I felt a sense of confusion and discontent as I walked away, realizing that a person who is meant to keep the community safe and orderly felt a great enough need to stop me and point out my ethnic ambiguity in the strange form of a pickup line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was here at UCSB, and especially after the cop encounter, where I started to reflect more on what these interactions actually meant to me and what their implications were. They definitely still didn’t mortally wound me in any way, but they did lead me to wonder more about what drove these men to feel a need to vocalize that they essentially saw me as nothing more than a confusingly ethnic object with a year-round tan and light-colored eyes. I would be lying if I said that none of the comments ever made me feel insecure or uncomfortable, but I was aware that from the majority of these people, the comments stemmed from a place of social ignorance, not malice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling someone “exotic” is not a good pickup line. It reinforces the idea that non-Western cultures are far removed and unusual, and this idea can potentially cause identity confusion for mixed-race people because a part of their background may be from a Western culture as well. In terms of dating and relationships, I am the first to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with asking a person about their ethnicity out of genuine interest and curiosity. However, it is important to understand the right context in which it is appropriate to pose the question and to not preface the question in a way that implies that the mixed-race person is somehow different or abnormal. If I’m telling a man about my family in Asia, it’s reasonable to expect him to want to know more about my familial and ethnic background, considering that I do not look full Asian. But if a man’s way of initiating flirting or demonstrating interest consists of making a fetishizing assumption about my perceived race, I can say with certainty that I will not continue to engage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my own experience, I haven’t gained enough confidence to call someone out for reducing me to my own ethnic ambiguity. However, it is important to realize that people react to things differently, so my personal anecdotes and reactions obviously can’t speak for every mixed-race ethnically ambiguous person. But as the mixed-race population in the United States continues to increase, it is clear that there are multifaceted social issues, including racial fetishism, that members of this group often face. Bringing visibility to these topics won’t eradicate them, but it will hopefully at least provoke people to be a bit more thoughtful and cognizant when discussing multiracial people’s backgrounds and traits. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anna Roy encourages people to consider the complexities of the dating world for ethnically ambiguous individuals.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca31d1fb8eebb6e4828ed3bc1e9d2984?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca31d1fb8eebb6e4828ed3bc1e9d2984?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anna-roy/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anna Roy</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anna Roy is an Opinion staff writer.

Despite my doubts, I would watch Miss Universe every year and see women who looked seemingly perfect. Like many, I wondered if I could be them one day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, beauty pageants revolved around the judgement of physical attributes, but since have evolved to include personality and talent. The talent competition, contestant profile and numerous question and answer portions illustrate this very point. They now strive to be </span><a href=\"https://todayvenezuela.com/2019/01/06/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-more-diverse-than-ever/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more inclusive of all races</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the intent of the Miss Universe pageant being “a way to celebrate women and diversity.” Additionally, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/17/miss-spain-becomes-first-transgender-woman-compete-miss-universe-pageant/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.731737227223\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first transgender contestant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> competed in the Miss Universe 2018 competition. While this may seem like a step in the right direction, the overwhelming public opinion says otherwise, arguing that </span><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-still-sexist-as-hell-and-not-what-we-need-right-now\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beauty pageants are sexist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of the burdensome expectations they impose on women to be “gorgeous, intelligent, and poised.” These critics often target the evening gown and swimsuit competition as the basis of their claims, as those parts of the competition are based solely on physical appearance. Miss America has responded to this enduring criticism by</span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ending-swimsuit-competition_us_5b167608e4b093ac33a1d36e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cutting the infamous swimsuit and evening gown competitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead aiming to focus on “honoring talent and scholarship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience. I was mostly piqued by curiosity and wanting to try something new, especially since it’s such a popular tradition in the South. There are many </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/literally-darling/trying-to-be-pretty-in-a-southern-beauty-pageant-town_b_7623954.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">societal expectations of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> associated with the notion of “Southern hospitality” that pervade the South; high importance is placed on appearing charming, beautiful, and poised. This is a direct link to the traditional archetype of Southern beauty and femininity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I did not fit the description of a stereotypical girl who would be interested in competing in beauty pageants. I was focused on my studies, my friends and my involvement in extracurriculars — not winning a beauty competition. My friend group, who were focused on similar things, surprisingly did not question my newfound curiosity. Some even showed up to watch and support me on the night of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first met girls in rehearsal who had been vying for the crown since they were toddlers, competing in numerous local and regional beauty contests to work their way up. I learned that the acquisition of one crown improved your pageant resume, in a sense, even if our high school competition was open to anyone in our school. Competing in our pageant also served as a valuable opportunity to practice poise, talent, etc. in preparation for later pageants. This, however, increased my skepticism upon entering the competition. Being the inexperienced outsider that I was, and lacking the shared intention to continue competing, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat excluded.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite both my skepticism and my expectations that all my competitors would have elitist attitudes, I unexpectedly made multiple friends during the process. Rehearsal was grueling and started uncharacteristically early for a two-hour pageant. We would practice the opening number and our exits and entrances </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over and over again</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> until I was sure that the directors in charge were taking the event way too seriously. We would laugh after rehearsal at the ridiculousness of the dance moves we had to memorize and the “walks” we had to perfect before the final day, which made me feel at ease. Although these girls had more experience than I did, they didn’t have the snobby attitudes I expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the morning of the pageant, the interview (which I didn’t prepare for) was the most telling part of the event. Every girl wore heels and bright dresses, with their makeup and hair already done. I didn’t have as much motivation to wake up early and get all of that done ahead of the 9 a.m. interview, and ended up dressing professionally with minimal makeup. Having done many academic and extracurricular interviews before, I believed I would nail it. However, the questions asked by the judges seemed almost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> serious, like they were searching for the perfect answer. They asked questions like “how do you handle cliques at school?” with facial expressions that read, “I’m not looking for an answer about real personal experience, but one that’s been rehearsed.” Despite not doing as well as I’d expected, I still had hope for the merit of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long day of preparation, the night of the pageant was still nerve-wracking, primarily because most of the girls were worried they would trip on stage or misspeak in front of the audience. When I used to watch the evening gown competition on TV, I imagined girls backstage gawking at each other, internally comparing who looked best in their dress. Instead, we all offered each other words of encouragement and praise before we individually took the stage. When the winners were announced at the end, we were happy for each other and grateful we got to develop friendships during the experience (I know, shocker!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. I didn’t realize until the end, when I found that I wasn’t as nervous onstage as I’d thought I’d be. It wasn’t that I wanted to look better than anyone, but that I felt confident in myself. But this wasn’t even the most rewarding aspect of participating. It was the moment when my mom came up to me afterwards with tears in her eyes, telling me how proud she was. To go on stage alone and walk in front of a crowd of people — many of whom attended my high school — with no prior experience as a beauty queen, was no easy feat. I didn’t care about what the judges or the audience thought of me, only about what I thought of myself, and I felt good.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants people to know the positive impacts beauty pageants can have on women.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86781\" style=\"width: 297px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86781\" data-attachment-id=\"86781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-09/argument-in-the-office-are-beauty-pageants-feminist-or-flawed/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=1792%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1792,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"beauty pageant kate ryan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=888%2C1015&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan-219x250.jpeg?resize=287%2C328\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=768%2C878&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=896%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 896w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?w=1792&amp;ssl=1 1792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Beauty Pageants: Only Skin Deep</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Emily Hickingbottom</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our current political and social climate, beauty pageants in the United States have become targets of widespread, controversial criticism. While competing in these competitions may seem innocent enough when girls are young, as years pass, competitions become increasingly focused on unrealistic physical beauty standards that can damage a girl’s self-image and confidence. Instead of teaching girls to strive for career focused and academic success, these competitions perpetuate the idea that “beauty” is a woman’s most important characteristic when determining her overall worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though certain people (*</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough cough*</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump) and recent events in the media might suggest otherwise, generally speaking, I’d like to think that we are living in a time where gender equality is the norm — particularly in the United States (though this isn’t always the reality). But, there is a startling disparity between the focus on male versus female sexuality in entertainment, specifically on television. There is a great deal of attention given to the Miss America Pageant and other pageants like it. These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements. The ideal candidate is many things: She is tall, but not too tall; thin, but not too thin; curvy, but in only the “right” places. Always smiling, always put together, always on cue. Women’s beauty and self-worth extend far beyond these superficial standards of attractiveness. Qualities involving attraction and beauty are not measured by the size of a woman’s waist or by the symmetry of her face. These measurements are shallow and speak volumes when evaluating what the Miss America competition and similar pageants represent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By allowing pageants to determine beauty or value based almost entirely on surface level characteristics, we are projecting harmful images about a woman’s “place” and purporting normative expectations of appearance, thus slowing our advancement into a more progressive society. With ever-changing definitions of femininity and beauty developing in America, competitions like Miss America, and the narrow beauty ideals they promote, are becoming increasingly outdated and are in dire need of greater scrutiny.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The danger of beauty pageants is evidenced in the name itself. They evaluate participants based solely upon physical “beauty” and reduce these women’s unique and individually remarkable features to nothing more than a series of numbers on a scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might disagree because of the question and answer portions included in some beauty pageants. While I grant that this gives the contestant an opportunity to showcase themselves outside the physical realm, there exists a long-standing expectation of fumbling failure amid this segment of the competition, held by viewers and judges alike. Contestants are called to answer what is typically a controversial, multifaceted question, who are then expected to respond eloquently, despite the pressure and lack of preparation for the question. It almost seems as if judges are waiting for contestants to fail, especially considering the judges’ and media’s reactions to incidents like </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miss-utah-usa-2013-fumbles-question_n_3451918\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miss Utah’s fumbled answers </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during her run for Miss USA in 2012.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building further on this point, we must also consider the corporate sponsorships and owners of these supposedly harmless, good-natured competitions. Of course, these large corporations would not want to promote an idea of beauty which gives women — particularly female viewers of the pageant — the idea that intellect and personal values are more important than living up to a rigid set of impossible beauty standards. If us women collectively came to that conclusion, we might not buy as much makeup, or shop as often or regularly allow men to determine our worth. We might argue more to receive equal pay or, worse yet, start speaking up for ourselves in situations where we don’t believe our interests are being equally represented. This is not to say that all businesses and corporations have these intentions, but when we stop to consider who is at the head of some of the major national pageants, it becomes apparent that their respective owners do not actively endorse gender equality, or even respect women, for that matter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, who owns them? Who has vested interests in the pageant’s success? In the case of Miss America, the owner and individual responsible for their continued success in 2015 was none other than </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/miss-usa-2018-miss-america-tries-rebrand-trump-s-former-ncna876246\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it’s safe to say that, given our current political climate and Donald Trump’s infamy in the United States, we are fully aware that his version of respecting women is far from acceptable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, I imagine watching my future daughter up on stage, competing in a Miss California or Miss USA pageant and, immediately, I am overcome with anger. In a time when gender equality and sexual freedom are at a peak in our current society, I would hope that women don’t need validation from a select group of biased judges with predisposed preferences for a narrow set of characteristics, predetermined by heterosexual, white, male owners and sponsors of the competitions. I think the idea that beauty can be defined by physical characteristics is, in and of itself, a toxic concept. If we could define beauty by a specific set of physical characteristics, then we could, theoretically, define what characteristics make an individual unattractive as well. When considering things from the reverse perspective, the thought that we can identify beauty purely based on appearance seems absolutely absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth. Generations of young women, including the young women on this campus, are presently growing up in the shadow of a misogynistic president and his anti-feminist ideals. And unfortunately, despite my belief that pageantry might have the capability to change into a valuable experience for young women under the right leadership and reform, the overwhelmingly powerful presence of men like Trump in this arena makes it extremely difficult to separate the positives from the negatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all beautiful, each of us in our own unique ways, both physically and mentally.

But however aware I am that this particular arrangement is odd, it also feels so normal. I have been sharing all of the details of my life with my dad for as long as can remember, so why would I suddenly begin to keep things secret from him? Particularly since I have discovered that sharing details with my father allows me much more freedom to do such “debaucherous” things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad has explained to me that his number one concern is always my safety. In sharing with him the details about what I am up to, he knows that I am being safe about the decisions I am making. Because he is comfortable with and aware of the way I handle myself around boys and booze, he is more willing to accept some of the more experimental decisions I make while navigating new college experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father’s golden rule is that there are two types of mistakes in this world: revocable and irrevocable. The wise old man always discusses how irrevocable mistakes, such as getting in a car with a drunk driver or getting myself killed in any way, are mistakes that he could never forgive me for making. However, in life you are allowed to make as many revocable mistakes as you’d like. Don’t get me wrong, revocable mistakes suck, they are dumb and hurtful and we all have to deal with these decisions that come back to bite us in the ass in our lives. But knowing that my dad doesn’t fault me for making these mistakes means that I am able to have a person who supports me through these sometimes difficult circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this is the most important thing I have gained from being honest with my parents.
