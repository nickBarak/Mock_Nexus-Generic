Featuring pounding drums and electric guitar, “Change” is an anthem about history repeating itself, tearing down walls and imminent revolution. Its message seems overtly political, especially considering the timing of its release — November 2008. Yet at no point in the song does Taylor speak to any specific issues. When subsequently asked about her political leanings, she replied, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not going to sit here and go into my political views, because that’s not what I chose to do. I chose to do music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next decade, Swift remained tight-lipped about politics. But in the Trump era, in which the nation is increasingly divided along partisan lines, silence is no longer acceptable. Celebrities have faced mounting pressure to openly pledge their allegiance to red or blue. Thus, Taylor Swift found herself trapped in a catch-22. If she kept quiet, people would accuse her of being a closeted Republican. If she spoke out, people would denounce her for using politics to bolster her image or criticize her for stepping outside her role as an entertainer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Sunday, Swift decided to go with the latter. In an impassioned Instagram post, she endorsed Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee and implored her followers to head to the polls on Nov. 6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before I go any further, I want to make something clear: Celebrities are hardly ever qualified to speak with authority on political issues. And yet, their influence cannot be overstated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 112 million followers, Taylor Swift is currently the seventh most followed person on Instagram. Her “vote” post received nearly three million likes. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vote.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that in the 24 hours after she posted, there was a significant spike in voter registration in both Tennessee and nationwide — almost half a million people in total. In one day, more people registered to vote in Tennessee than they did for nearly the entire month of September.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If celebrities care about their fans at all — especially those who face systemic oppression — they should urge people to vote.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A celebrity’s massive influence presents an opportunity to make a real difference. People ought to use whatever means they have at their disposal to promote civic engagement. Average citizens can do their part by volunteering to knock on doors in their neighborhoods; celebrities can do theirs by reaching out to people across the country via social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voter registration is one of the most responsible ways a celebrity can utilize their power. It’s a far more ethical alternative to selling sponsored products or sheer self-promotion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swift and other newly active celebrities have received backlash for exactly that: exploiting politics to boost their reputations. Her detractors deemed her endorsement of democratic candidates an act of “performative wokeness.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if a person donates a million dollars to cancer research just to impress their friends, they still donated a million dollars to cancer research. In other words: Even if a celebrity’s motive for promoting political engagement is superficial, does it matter?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s look at the bigger picture: Taylor Swift has mobilized over 500,000 people to hit the polls. Whether or not they vote for the people she endorsed, they will still vote, and that is what matters most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those still opposed to celebrity involvement in politics, consider the alternative. The decision to stay silent is a total waste of a unique position. By choosing silence, celebrities put themselves on the side of everyone who refuses to watch the news because “it depresses them.” The ability to turn off the TV is an immense privilege. Meanwhile, marginalized people, who stand a lot to gain or lose from the upcoming election, can’t afford to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pay attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If celebrities care about their fans at all — especially those who face systemic oppression — they should urge people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten years ago, Swift’s refusal to comment on politics was less consequential. This November, the stakes are higher than ever. Simply telling people to register, regardless of their views, is critical. While Taylor Swift will not solely determine this election’s outcome, her choice to post can make a greater impact than you or I can on our own. If she inspires her fans to vote for the “change” her song calls for, so be it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harper Lambert wants celebrities to use their power responsibly.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84437\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84437\" data-attachment-id=\"84437\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/argument-in-the-office-are-celebrities-obligated-to-speak-now-on-politics/img_1483/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=2048%2C1467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_1483\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=888%2C637&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84437\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=888%2C636\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=768%2C550&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=1024%2C734&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Celebrities Should Stay in Hollywood</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Laurel Rinehart</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think of Taylor Swift, my mind automatically goes back to a simpler and more optimistic time: 2009. With her cowboy boots and signature ringlet curls, her appearance is something my friends and I have always tried to emulate at school dances. Taylor Swift’s music became the soundtrack of our lives at the height of our middle school years. Before Instagram made me question my self-worth and the news cycle made me question the stability of democratic values, her wholesome lyrics and music videos constituted a large portion of my media consumption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the social and political landscape has morphed into something surreal and chaotic, and the media landscape has evolved in a similar fashion. Rather than allowing people to escape political issues, Twitter and Instagram force users to confront them head-on. Celebrities and laypeople alike participate in this often convoluted arena of discourse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of a few weeks ago, the formerly apolitical Taylor Swift is no exception. To some Americans, her Instagram post advocating for liberal causes and encouraging Tennessee residents to vote for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections seems like a step in the right direction. If celebrities have the ability to spread positive messages to a large audience of followers, why not take advantage of the opportunity? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On an individual level, Taylor Swift’s Instagram post can be seen as a positive phenomenon because she encouraged civic participation. However, her fans’ overwhelming response illustrates an alarming precedent regarding the power of celebrities, especially ones uneducated in the realm of politics, to influence the behavior of huge groups of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media sites have unchecked power to shape public opinion on a mass scale. Instagram, Swift’s platform of choice for posting this political message, has one billion monthly users — many of whom are young and impressionable. And these individuals aren’t just visiting social apps for escapist entertainment; a 2017 Pew Research poll found that 67 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large number of people getting their information from unregulated social media content has proven to have devastating consequences. Preceding the 2016 presidential election, a Russian firm published a series of inflammatory posts and ads intended to dissuade Democrats from voting for Hillary Clinton, reaching an estimated 150 million people in total. It is impossible to know for sure whether the results of the election would have differed if this content had not been disseminated, but it is clear that nowadays anyone can deliver information to the masses with ease. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers have a responsibility to understand the power they have and to refrain from misleading their followers.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if this political campaign had been delivered by a celebrity with a scope of influence akin to that of Taylor Swift. Celebrities manage to sell worthless products on social media due to their large following and the extent to which they are idolized by their fans, and a political message would likely have a similar effect. Though Taylor Swift’s message dramatically boosted voter registration — a positive effect in a political system whose function depends on civic participation — there is no way of ensuring that every celebrity’s call to action will be ethical or well-informed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expressing “woke” opinions on social media is now a trend that many people follow to prove they are informed and engaged during an extremely political era. However, celebrities are not always qualified to provide factually accurate information that serves as a basis for Americans’ political decisions. It’s not inherently problematic for prominent figures to engage in political discourse; however, it is alarming to think that citizens may view these posts as fact without researching the issues further on more reputable platforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decade ago, the stakes for political involvement were not nearly as high as they are now. We belted out the lyrics to “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story” without giving a single thought to the political leanings of their creator because, at the time, politics belonged in the realm of politicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, everything seems to have a political slant, and people are looking to their favorite influencers for guidance on how to view the world. These influencers have a responsibility to understand the power they have and to refrain from misleading their followers. If that responsibility is not met, the consequences could be significant. Unless they think their knowledge is on the level of a professional journalist or politician, celebrities should set their personal political agendas aside and stick to advocating for Flat Tummy Tea.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurel Rinehart wants celebrities to stay in their lanes.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

As opposed to other schools where the parties are exclusively put on by fraternities or athletic organizations, Isla Vista offers a plethora of house parties along the ocean every weekend that are hosted by students in private, unaffiliated residences. This creates a party culture in which anyone, regardless of their involvement with Greek life or athletics, can find a location on a Friday or Saturday night where they will be able to drink and dance the night away. What makes UCSB party culture stand out is not the size or frequency of the gatherings, but its open and inclusive nature.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84100\" style=\"width: 398px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84100\" data-attachment-id=\"84100\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/who-can-partake-in-party-culture/image_123986672-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=1633%2C1563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1633,1563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=888%2C850&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-84100\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=388%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?w=1633&amp;ssl=1 1633w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=768%2C735&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C980&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But is this narrative really true?

Almost every girl wears a full face of makeup and a variation of the standard uniform of high-waisted shorts and a crop top. There is nothing wrong with dressing this way — I myself have a closet full of “hoe clothes” from which I select my outfits every weekend — but it creates a pressure to conform for girls who wish to partake in the party scene but may not be comfortable putting their bodies on display for any number of reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the dress code, the rules for getting into parties are strict and largely based on gender. Conventionally attractive girls are almost guaranteed entry at every door; for male students, however, passage is much more complicated. In accordance with the norms at most other universities, fraternity parties are essentially off-limits for non-members. However, even the supposedly open house parties on DP are very exclusive and typically do not allow male students to enter unless they know the host of the party or are accompanied by a large group of girls. Residents of private homes have the right to allow or deny entry to whomever they choose, and I’m not suggesting that there should be some sort of requirement for parties to be open to every single student. I simply wish to bring attention to the underlying problematic message in the choice of who can and cannot enter: if you are not an attractive, sexually available female, there is no place for you in one of these gatherings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overtly sexual dynamic within parties is another aspect that isolates people who do not wish to partake in the “hookup culture” that has become synonymous with college life. While sexual comments and unwanted groping are the most prevalent at fraternity parties — at least in my experience — these behaviors are still the norm at any party you attend. While partygoers obviously have the option of simply hanging out with their friends and saying “no” to any sexual advances, there is an overwhelming feeling that if you are not open to advances or directly engaging in sexual dancing, you are in the wrong place.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the hookup culture of UCSB parties is overwhelmingly heterosexual. Look around and you will see numerous straight couples grinding or making out on the dance floor, but there do not seem to be spaces where LGBTQ students can express their sexuality so easily. The heteronormative aspect of college party life is often blamed on fraternity culture in think-pieces about American colleges in general; however, this exclusive norm extends beyond Greek life where UCSB is concerned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whiteness is another unspoken requirement for students to feel that they fit in at most house parties. Though I am white and cannot speak personally about minority students’ experiences, I have had conversations with several students of color who expressed feeling uncomfortable in the mostly white party crowd. For whatever reason, the percentage of people of color inside a typical party is even lower than that within UCSB’s predominantly white student body. There is no way of measuring whether this is due to non-white students being turned away at the door or if the dominant culture causes them to avoid parties altogether. Whatever the reason, there is unfortunately a normative racial pattern that makes people of color feel unwelcome or out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all these critiques, I am not saying that parties in Isla Vista should stop altogether or that students should boycott them. It is inevitable that partying will occur as part of the college experience, and no aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality. All I’m asking is for people to direct a more critical eye at the assumption that UCSB is an exception to the typical exclusivity at party schools solely because our parties are not controlled by Greek organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB party culture is the land where everyone is welcome. That is, everyone who fits the standards of both appearance and behavior for the perfect partygoer: white, in impeccable shape, heterosexual and willing to flirt and dance with strangers. We need to promote a new paradigm in which the diversity that UCSB claims to celebrate is actually present within its famous party scene.</span></p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart wants you to question your perceptions of the party scene.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

I had transferred schools four times before then, and my middle school best friend had transferred to another school district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then this curly-haired, brown-eyed girl sat next to me in my second period Spanish class, and the only reality I had ever known flew out the fucking window. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me seven months to realize I was in love with her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came out to my parents three hours after that life-shattering realization. To my then-love, a year later. Most of my friends, 11 months after that. Slowly, one after another, the people in my life began to learn that I, Evelyn Spence, was attracted to women – even while I was still struggling to learn exactly what that meant. Bisexual? Pansexual? Queer? Lesbian? </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been four years, and I have slowly become comfortable with the blue, purple and pink that accompany the bisexual label. I have the bi colors in hearts in my Twitter bio, a rainbow emoji next to my name on Instagram and a photo of me sprawled out under a giant ass-inflatable rainbow as my Facebook profile photo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here’s the thing: I am 19 years old now, and I am Still. Coming. Out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come out every day: When I walk down the street with my bi-flag sweatshirt on and meet eyes with the stranger crossing the street, I come out. When I call my crush “babe” in front of the Starbucks barista, I come out. When I hold hands with a girl at the mall near my house, when I make gay jokes to those I’ve just met and when I clip my fifth queer pin to my backpack, I come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out is a jumble of emotions and tears and laughter and brings on more awkward conversations than I ever thought were possible. I have come out to many people in my 19 years, but there are still those who remain unaware of my rampant queerness, such as my grandmother, who will finally know after she reads this article, and the coming out will begin again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a huge difference between 15 and 19 – now, students of UCSB and beyond, I am proud to announce that I am no longer afraid of coming out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posting queer and bi posts on my Instagram and Twitter no longer bring out that uneasiness in the pit of my stomach. I no longer cover up my gay and bi shirts with black leather jackets; I send my father pictures of myself in front of rainbow flags; I scream “GAY!” in the street every time I see something remotely rainbow related. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I very recently visited the Castro District in San Francisco. I’m sure you can all guess how that went.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am no longer nervous to tell the world who I am, and that is the point I am trying to make in this article. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those still in the closet, to those with one foot in and one foot out, to those who are terrified to even to be associated with the rainbow, let me tell you that one day, you will be able to let go of that breath you are holding – and yes, I stole that partly from “Love, Simon,” but the point remains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I could’ve said that to my 15-year-old self.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This piece is a summary of my coming out, but this is also an open letter to all of you who are afraid; this is a letter to those of you who are scared to hold your love’s hand in the street and to those of you who cannot tell your parents who you are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I am speaking from a place of privilege. I was lucky enough to be born to a mother who knew I was queer two years before I did and a father who still loves me, even though I know he will never be at peace with what he believes is a “made-up” sexuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my parents, I say that in my 19 years I have met people who place themselves on all levels of the Kinsey scale. Nothing in life ever fits into a neat little box, so why should sexuality be the one that does? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you – if you do not have a support system at home, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you will find one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I have found a family with friends who celebrate my queerness. I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find those people. Even when it gets hard, even when you can’t breathe anymore, even when it feels like your life has become tragedy incarnate. It may take a while – it took me four years – but happiness is worth waiting for because one day, you will no longer be afraid of coming out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pinky promise. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence wants people to know that she is a HUGE fan of the rainbow emoji.

This power comes from a certain level of vulnerability that is mutually accepted throughout the development of a relationship. When we love one another or open ourselves up, exposing and addressing our flaws and concerns or intimate details of our lives, we are giving another person the opportunity to hurt us and simply trusting they won’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheating or infidelity is an act of betrayal that often breaks the trust that a healthy, growing relationship necessitates. While cheating may not mean our partner has lost all previously possessed feelings for us, I urge us to stray from the normalizing and acceptance of cheating not only because it is a behavior that is disrespectful and hurtful amongst other things, but more so because it is an act that can easily be avoided with a little respect and communication.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are fueled by love and desire throughout our relationships and in all relationships; it is important for each person to be open and honest not only with their partners but with themselves about these factors. Psychotherapist Esther Perel, known for her work with erotic intelligence, emphasizes the distinction between love and desire by explaining, “if there is a verb… that comes with love, it is ‘to have.’ And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ‘to want.’ In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance… We want closeness. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we’ve already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with… In desire, we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words… fire needs air. Desire needs space.”’ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that point, there may be many factors that lead someone to cheat on or betray their partner. Often when someone has been cheated on their first reaction is to assume their partner no longer loves them or has the feelings they previously did for them. Many people ask themselves why they weren’t enough and begin to question every aspect of themselves depending on the level of intimacy and closeness of the relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While it is easier to fall into the pattern of these assumptions, these thoughts can often put us in a worse position than if we look at the situation objectively. Because a partner cheated does not necessarily mean they have lost all of the feelings that were previously held. However, this important acknowledgment does not justify infidelity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For what it’s worth, I have in fact been cheated on, and while the cheating didn’t initially end my six-year relationship, I felt the situation and the pain as a result of the situation could have been avoided had my boyfriend at the time addressed with me that he no longer wanted to be in a committed relationship. The words, at first, are hard to get out, but for someone who truly cares about their partner, no matter the level of intimacy, they must acknowledge how their partner would feel if they cheated on them instead of addressing the situation and know that not speaking up will result in a worse outcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that addressing your desires will free your partner of all pain as a byproduct of the relationship. Chances are, if you are ending a relationship to pursue another, your partner will be hurt, but there are feelings of closure that come with a discussion that do not come with betrayal. Betrayal is a disregard of a partner’s feelings. A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this issue comes from the change in what conventional relationships are. What is considered “acceptable” today? Millennials are perpetually in limbo, grappling between what feels right and what has been established as right. In a relationship, it is okay to want what you want, but you must be able to acknowledge that a relationship takes two; you have to communicate and be clear while also taking into consideration what your partner wants as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more and more millennials are transitioning away from marriage, so-called “unconventional” relationships are becoming a norm. It is okay to have an open relationship. It is okay to be friends with benefits or casually date, but it is not okay to commit to someone and act differently before having a conversation. Not talking is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think we should normalize cheating but normalize other types of relationships as long as the people involved are 100 percent aware of what the relationship is. We need to hold ourselves, our friends, our peers and our loved ones accountable. It is not that difficult to avoid cheating and the more we make excuses for one another the more likely it is for this behavior to continue.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana Kamelian implores individuals to consider the serious negative consequences that can result from infidelity.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cheating Isn’t So Bad</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83702\" style=\"width: 382px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83702\" data-attachment-id=\"83702\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/image_123986672-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"372,277\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83702\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=372%2C277\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll start with a disclaimer: I have never cheated on someone nor do I hope to. I don’t think cheating on someone is something you should try to do, but I want to suggest with this article that cheating is not something that makes you a bad person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider polyamorous people (those in more-than-two-people relationships of various configurations) because they have an interesting view on the issue. Not to generalize, but within the polyamorous community, there is something known as “compersion.” Compersion is that good feeling you get when your partner has happy romantic feelings about someone else. The response to one’s partner saying “I slept with someone else today!” is “good for you!” Ridiculous, right?! Obviously, you should be unhappy about it, and you should make the person you supposedly love feel bad for having sex with someone else. S/he did betray you, after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, doesn’t that sound familiar? Do scarlet letters, witch burnings and slut-shaming ring the same bells? They should. They are founded on the same unpleasant feelings. I ask that if you ever find yourself having those feelings, and you start to think of cheaters as a lower class of people, as less than moral, less than good, you’ll let your thoughts roll over those periods in history when adulterers were executed. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ask that you think about the more than several countries that to this day designate death as legal punishment for adultery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And maybe you’ll think about what some people like to do to others they find to be less than moral, less than good. I’m not being hyperbolic. I’m just saying that these sentiments, when mixed with power, do great evil—much greater evil than two people having consensual sex ever did—so they shouldn’t be fed or entertained. They shouldn’t be given credence.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone cheats on you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t love you. At the very least, it means they wanted to have sex, and someone else was there for them that wanted to have sex too. It could absolutely mean more, and I think that’s something that you, as a couple, should figure out. Talk. Be there for each other. And if you can’t do that, you should probably break up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more often than not, cheating in a relationship is a symptom rather than the disease. There is something making that person look elsewhere. Whether that be for love, some type of connection or even an escape, the relationship should address it or risk becoming volatile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life. It doesn’t work like that. Love doesn’t work like that. Love isn’t a decision made in a single instant; it’s a continuous effort. Intimacy takes work. If you’re in a relationship, you should be open about those feelings and desires. Whether they be yours or your partner’s, pretending they don’t exist is a form of cruelty. Hearts can break in silence. Resentment can fester. Then, one day, the love you had seems to blow up. And it seems to be gone in a single instant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that cheating hurts people. I understand that it leaves people feeling betrayed and disposable, that it makes people feel like garbage. And I think that’s terrible. It’s terrible that people come out of unfaithful relationships with years of trust issues and residual pain, and I think the blame for that rests on all of our shoulders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is all of our responsibility to talk about cheating without stigmatizing any group of people, cheat-ers or cheat-ees. We should recognize that jealousy comes from a selfish and possessive place, and we should remember that sex is (fairly) universal. Everyone may find themselves attracted to someone besides the one they’re already involved with, but that doesn’t mean that the love you already have is reduced in any way. We should have more realistic expectations of ourselves and the ones we love. No one’s self-worth should rely on the faithfulness of any one person because faithfulness does not equate to love. Love is a bridge built every day by openness and understanding.</span></p>\n<p><em>Konrad Neithercutt calls for an understanding approach to infidelity that humanizes cheaters and acknowledges the legitimate root of the issue.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/","id":5610,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[5609,5608,5607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I Have To Have Sex With Someone Before I Can Get To Know Them","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2018-06-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image_123986672-2-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image_123986672-2-1.jpg?resize=451%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Veronica Meyers explains why getting down with someone is her favorite ice-breaker.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to have sex with someone first before I can get to know them.

I am not kidding. Specifically, a very firm handshake. There’s something about seeing the other person naked and at their most vulnerable that makes me more comfortable with them afterwards. I wouldn’t necessarily identify it as a way to receive instant gratification because it isn’t; it’s just my preferred method of a fun icebreaker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most times it backfires. I’ve had people tell me after sex that what we’re doing is too fast or that they’re not looking for anything serious. But the thing is, I don’t think I’m going too fast, and maybe I don’t want anything serious as well. For me, sex isn’t an indicator of how developed a relationship is because I don’t think sex is that serious. It’s just my way of creating an initial bond. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had a guy break up with me once because I failed to offer him enough of a “chase.” This is understandable. For him the chase was the road that led up to the sex, but for me the chase was what we could have achieved even after the sex. I refuse to see sex as the pinpoint or climax (pun intended) of a relationship, and that’s part of the reason of why I do it first. How well can we connect with each other even after the fact? Can we do something more with our relationship?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think society puts too much pressure on sex to be this big, relationship-time-marker when it’s simply just a form of interaction.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before an old white dude can post in the comments section about what I should do with my body instead, let me tell you this: have you ever considered the idea that intimacy doesn’t always have to rely on sex? I’m not saying that sex isn’t sacred or special or important because it is all those things. What I’m saying is that there is a deeper form of bond and communication than sex, and to me, reaching this medium together is the chase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a different kind of thrill that comes with trying to find another, nonsexual way to bond after sex because the strongest forms of intimacy lie in actions that are the least sexual. I think society puts too much pressure on sex to be this big, relationship-time-marker when it’s simply just a form of interaction. I know that most people place more importance on sex than I do, but this is just how I view sex to be. Sex is just sex, and sex would be nothing but a daily happening if it weren’t for the heavy implications and taboo society imposes upon it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

Tinder is the stage on which you perform your grueling mating dance, and the sole audience member is you, clapping maniacally like Shia Labeouf.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For about an hour I digitally peacocked and scoured through matches. Sometimes people get straight to the point. They’ll ask you what you’re looking for on Tinder. Shamelessly, I had no good reason for being on this app: I had no end goal, no desire to fulfill an emotional or physical void, no interest in meeting the father of my future children. I was here to waste time. My bio? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like butter, meat, and your sense of humor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this glorious lowest common denominator bio I let it be known that I’m here to practice conversation and jab daintily at fragile masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be your manic pixie meme girl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come across a particular guy who checks off my three boxes: He </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) hasn’t call me a bitch yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) made an appropriate use of the sprout emoji. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) looks like he hasn’t shaved since the last presidential election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks like we have a winner! Let’s call him Brian. Brian and I meet up on DP for a stroll; it’s Deltopia and the happiness in the air is palpable (read: DP smelled like the devil’s lettuce). Brian tells me about his nerdy science stuff, makes very intentional eye contact as he tells me about his mission to cure cancer and save millions of lives, and tells me about his sweet family from North Carolina. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we walk the length of DP, he asked me if I’d like a massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be clear: if a stranger offers you a massage, you should probably take all necessary precautions and evaluate the risk vs. reward. Ask yourself the important questions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How good are you at martial arts? Do you have pepper spray? Could you overpower this potential attacker? Do you have a loyal dog who could accompany you? Do his hands even look strong enough to knead out the decades of trauma in your shoulders? Once you’ve jumped through those hoops, you can say yes to the massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far. I say “so far” because I’m not rich enough to dabble in Scientology yet. But I think I got a taste of what Tom Cruise probably feels like every day. I felt rebirthed: my arms became wings, I was given a new spine, every knot in my entire back from years of self-inflicted stress melted away. He whipped out an industrial sized bottle of organic lemon hemp lotion and pumped handfuls of the goop into his palms, slathering it across my shoulders. The lotion felt like mayo on my skin. I didn’t care. I wish he owned a pillow but who was I to complain? I should probably buy him a pillow for his service. I gained back four years of my life that day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He didn’t even want a massage in return, probably because my fingers look about as strong as vermicelli. A week later, I developed a weird rash on my back from the lotion, but to me they were only a sweet reminder of a glorious, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> massage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder. Most of us download dating apps to satisfy our personal needs for emotional or sexual gratification, to either meet friends or flings or future partners; until Deltopia weekend, I thought these were the only benefits to be reaped from this embarrassing app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should consider accepting a massage. You could ask for one if it wasn’t offered. You should consider giving someone a massage. A massage culture would bring a whole new meaning to “I Gaucho back.”  Maybe the massage will be so good you’ll want it to be more than a massage. Maybe, in the year 2045, the notion of being a good kisser will give way to the importance of giving great massages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matching with Brian’s massage skills was a stroke of serendipity: I know that not everyone will have the same luck I did. You might find an amateur who has not learned the full potential of his opposable thumbs; you may encounter a deviant who does little tickly motions that haunt you for weeks to come; you could even bump into a lazy boy who massages you for only a fleeting moment before complaining. Or maybe, just maybe, you’ll match with Brian. </span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Chen wants to open people’s eyes to a new way of using Tinder.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

In other news, the Earth is round. The Sun is hot. Did I mention water is wet? As Spring Quarter speeds to a close, even the freshmen have probably come to this conclusion by now. A newfound sense of freedom, access drugs and alcohol and anonymity all come together to create the perfect environment for casual sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsurprisingly, sex is a hot topic of discussion in college, whether you’re talking about a latest hookup after a night out or trading your worst hookup stories at a kickback. With everyone talking about sex, it may be easy to come to the conclusion that everyone is doing it. Well, that’s not the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ladies and gentlemen of UCSB and beyond, I am a virgin. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Abstaining for religious reasons? Waiting for marriage? Physically unable to? Emotionally unable to? The list goes on. Feel free to add some of your own assumptions to keep it interesting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all of these are completely valid reasons not to have sex, would you believe me, if I told you that the reason why I’m still a virgin is, in fact, none of those reasons?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m going to be 100 percent honest with you guys because I feel like we’ve really established a sense of trust within the last two minutes. The reason why I haven’t had sex yet is because the right moment with the right guy just hasn’t presented itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my own awkward and naive fashion, I have had my fair share of defusing and escaping from sexual propositions. Now, I’m not looking for a bed of roses by candlelight experience with the absolute love of my life, but I’m also just not infatuated with the idea of a casual hookup. If I wanted to, I could find a random dude and get the deed done. However, as appealing as that sounds, I’m going to have to pass on that one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re someone who enjoys the hookup culture, then more power to you. Keep on doing what you’re doing. If you’re someone who wants more than the casual sexual encounter, well, there’s nothing wrong with wanting more. In a culture where forming an emotional attachment to your casual hookup is the greatest violation of college social norms, it may seem unthinkable to even want something meaningful.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason why I haven’t had sex yet is because the right moment with the right guy just hasn’t presented itself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God forbid someone actually develops feelings. Even though college seems like the place where almost everyone has a list of all of the people they’ve banged and the person you like just “isn’t the relationship type,” if the idea of casually hooking up with a stranger, or a friend, or the person you like doesn’t appeal to you, you’re not alone. It doesn’t appeal to me either. It doesn’t appeal to a lot more people than you may think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often joke around to my friends that I may, in fact, die a virgin. And although I doubt I’ll live to the ripe old age of 72 (the average life expectancy for females in the U.S.) with my v-card still intact, this scenario is totally plausible. Tomorrow, I could be biking on my way to class, and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m hit by a car. If that happens, feel free to write “DIED A VIRGIN” on my tombstone. I won’t mind. I’ll laugh from the afterlife.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knows, maybe I’ll end up like the 19-year-old girl who sold her virginity for $3.87 million (Just kidding, Dad!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my second year of college comes to a close, I’ve had quite a bit of time to reflect on my virgin status and I’ve decided that there’s really no point in stressing about it. I’ve never been in a relationship, but one day I will be. Or not. I’ve never had sex, but one day I will. Or not. Life is unpredictable like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Hagrid once said, “What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he was talking about waiting for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to make the next move in the wizarding world, and not a college student pondering the prospect of her virginity, I’ll just keep living my life to that motto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One ice breaker I’ve experienced was sharing our worst hookup stories, so we could all bond over the universally hilarious and cringey aspects of hookup culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once it was my turn, I had no choice but to divulge, “I’ve never hooked up with anyone, but my first kiss was nice!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Precious, I know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who you’ve had sex with, who you are having sex with, who you aren’t having sex with—none of this defines you. Even though it can be easy to get caught up in the hookup culture, life is too short to do anything that doesn’t make you happy. College is even shorter.

The privacy of Facebook Messenger provides an interaction not unlike a silent auction: anonymous bids that push the limit to an object’s worth. A community like ours has a diverse range of socioeconomic brackets and OBO is, theoretically, a wonderful way to engage many potential buyers of varying willingness to pay with an enticing low starting price. In a stroke of serendipity, OBO works brilliantly for the online flea market that is Free &amp; For Sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While OBO has proven its practicality for Brandy Melville tube tops and seven-year-old IKEA night stands, it is inherently unethical to surge pricing on Rideshare. To me, Rideshare is about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (surprise). It’s a relatively safe way of offering your neighbor a much-appreciated seat, it’s a kind nod to the environment as you switch left to the carpool lane, but most of all, it’s a conscious act of empathy. One could have driven alone and enjoyed a few hours of mindless podcasting, but instead chose the extra hassle of picking up and dropping off people who were on their way to music festivals, long distance relationships or families. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for a ride, people chip in for gas money (although not always required), light conversation and sometimes snacks. Gas money is a fair expectation for the driver, and I support this system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a recent trip home, my roommate came back to report that a trip from Isla Vista to Los Altos could cost up to $35, with some drivers auctioning off the seats to the best offer. It was no longer a first-come, first-serve basis that operated without a discriminatory barrier to entry. Drivers who see the opportunity to make the same type of ticket sales will follow in suit. Some people simply could not afford such a ride with those drivers, and in this particular example of broken capitalism, personal gain again trumps social responsibility.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Rideshare is not a tank top, it is not a coffee table, it is not a discounted eyelash extension service. It is a helping hand, a generous deed that is returned graciously with a thankful Venmo payment or a couple of crumpled tens. I’ve had pleasant experiences with Rideshare: incredibly kind people who didn’t make me sit in the middle seat, who charged at most $25 and told me about their art project for Art 7A. They take extra precaution to drive without alarming their passengers and either already know the way or have a navigation system in place. Sometimes gum will be offered; occasionally an aux cord will be tossed into your lap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my friend Jessica said in a moment of reflection, “Rideshare drivers are the unregulated oligopolists of the Free &amp; For Sale world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a girl picked me up in her seven-seater on my way home to the East Bay, she arranged the seating meticulously. He sits here, she sits there. It finally made sense when the girl who “agreed to sit in the seat without the seatbelt” showed up for her spot in the middle row. We paid $35 one way regardless of drop-off location as she made her way to Sacramento. The driver drove at 90 miles per hour while she navigated from an iPad in the middle console, checked texts and even picked up a phone call with one hand on the way there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, it was my decision to opt for a five-hour ride in her van instead of a 10-hour journey on Amtrak, but was it fair to ask for gas money when you could not ensure the safety of your passengers? Using GasBuddy, I calculated that her 2002 Chevy Suburban, driving 388 miles from Isla Vista to Sacramento, would cost around $78.44 for 31 gallons. I’m using GasBuddy, which gives idealistically low gas prices, so let’s say that she got unlucky with some gas station on the way, and that it cost her an even Benjamin Franklin. For the seven of us, we were charged $35 each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was it ethical for her to ask a grand total of $245? Or am I being an ungrateful bitch? If I wanted to pay for a ride that gave me the thrill of possible imminent death, I would have preferred Six Flags. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I messaged her to cancel a return ride because of safety concerns (did I mention we knocked over a traffic drum?), she typed for a minute, paused and responded, “I wish you would have told me sooner so I could have filled the spot.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my gentle but perhaps ungrateful reminder that we were driving on the 101 and not the Nürburgring, she replied, “By no means will you ever be subject to my driving again.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Chen wants Gauchos to help each other without green on their minds.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

that “when someone says hello or smiles at you, your automatic reaction is to say hello or smile back.” Human beings as a whole strive to make connections to feel included in the group around them. In fact, the importance of greeting others has even been supported with movements such as “Just Say Hello,” a campaign supported by celebrities such as Oprah and Tom Hanks. You know that if Oprah supports something, it has to be legitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying “Hello” is a key part in building community, which is why it’s part of my job as a desk attendant in the residence halls to greet everyone who walks into the lobby. Chances are, if you’ve walked past the front desk in my residence hall, you’ve probably been met with my only-vaguely-mechanical-sounding “Hello.” For the most part, people return the gesture and say “Hello” back. Sometimes, I even get a “How’s it going?” If you’re one of these people, the rest of this article does not apply to you. I appreciate how polite you are, and I’m glad to be one of your desk attendants. You are a gem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the rest of you though, I have one simple question.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why won’t you say “Hi” back? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you look me straight in the eyes, making intense eye-contact as you walk by. “Hello!” I say cheerfully. Your eyes narrow as you make your way past the front desk, refusing to smile or even do the acknowledging head-nod.

Do you do this to everyone? Is it your thing to just not say “Hi” to people? Do other people respond like I do, sitting in confused silence? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also a few of you who just put so much effort into not saying “Hi” back that I feel kind of bad.  You enter the lobby with such purpose, avoiding eye contact and walking around the very outskirts of the room. I see you. Do you think I don’t? Just because you’re hugging the walls doesn’t mean that you’re invisible. This isn’t a middle school dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes I think I won’t say “Hi” to you, since you’re clearly very intent on getting by without responding. Then I remember that it’s part of my job, and bleakly say “hi” [[cap]] as you continue slinking along against the wall. Okay. You do you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get it. Sometimes you’ve had a bad day, and you really don’t want to talk to anyone. You want to retreat to the comfort of your dorm room and sleep away the rest of your day. You </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">especially </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t want to say “Hi” to the awkward girl at the front desk. Ultimately, everyone has these days, and I completely understand. Every so often, someone who typically greets me in return will walk by and not respond, only to go back to normal the next day. That’s fine, I get it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, college is about making connections.

Particularly in physical relationships,  there are many ways to be vulnerable to your partner and if an open, accepting environment hasn’t been established, expressing your honest opinion could very well be one of those ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as we hate to admit it, vulnerability will inevitably play a role in every sexual relationship we have, the first reason being that we’re naked. Unless you have been gifted with the shamelessness of a baby, being naked is a very vulnerable experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the seventh grade, my health teacher prefaced his sex talk with “If you’re not comfortable being alone naked in a room with someone, you probably shouldn’t be having sex.” At that point in my life, I wasn’t even comfortable being naked in a room by myself. Point being: we are all vulnerable from time to time, and acknowledging and accepting that vulnerability could do us wonders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to sexual vulnerability, whether it be with a new partner or with someone you’ve been with for years, there is often a pressing concern about whether or not what you’re doing is making your partner feel good, or whether or not you will be able to make them orgasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to be clear, no, sex is not like it appears in the movies. You will not always know your partner’s body,  and while WikiHow may be able to generally describe to you in bullet points “How to Give a Blow Job” or “What Makes a Girl Cum,” I can guarantee that no article would be able to tell you better than your partner would. Surprise, people masturbate and know their bodies! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something feels good, tell your partner, because chances are, they’re wondering just like you are and the affirmation could even add to the moment. It doesn’t have to be some elaborate PowerPoint about the logistics of your G-spot or a graph representing the sensitivity of your tip, but a simple “Don’t stop” could do the trick. Plus, what’s sexier than being able to trust and communicate with your partner?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being honest also means that when something doesn’t feel good, you express that too. When your partner asks “Does that feel good?” and you respond “Uhhh, yeah…” then neither of you are is getting anything out of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reinforcing the idea that what they’re doing feels good while you are either in pain or feeling nothing and your partner is completely misled. How are they supposed to know? And yes, there are the “obvious” physical reactions we have to sexual stimulation, but being told something doesn’t feel good will have a more “productive outcome” than someone trying to guess whether or not their partner is wet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes dicks just aren’t meant to bend the way you want them to bend and that’s something honesty has taught me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being completely honest, sex is so much better when you’re actually genuinely enjoying yourself and not worrying about whether or not you’re making your partner feel good. If your partner tells you and shows you how to make them feel good, you can probably assume with a higher degree of certainty that you’re making them feel pretty damn good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are many more aspects to physical relationships, honesty gives you the freedom, power and peace of mind to enjoy yourself and your partner. While I’ve primarily detailed honesty in physical relationships, I do believe honesty is important in every relationship whether that be with lovers, friends, family or even acquaintances,  and though the vulnerability and discomfort that comes with honesty is difficult to overcome, in the long run, your relationship, your partner and yourself will be able to benefit.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana

time here: I’ve spent hours studying in the brand-new wing of Davidson, I’ve seen the construction of multiple brand-new housing options, and I’ve seen upgrades to the Rec Cen and the student dining commons. But while this trend has ultimately been positive, it has also revealed some of the university’s greatest growing pains. And as the current chair of the UCen Governance Board, as well as an employee of the UCen for the past 2.5 years, I’ve come to understand one of these pain points firsthand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen, situated in the middle of campus, is one UCSB’s hallmark buildings. Originally built in 1968, the building was intended to be a common ground for students, faculty, and staff to convene and converse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some areas in the UCen haven’t been upgraded since its construction, and over time, it’s become a tarnished and underutilized space. For example, last quarter, leaks caused a ceiling tile to fall to the ground, narrowly missing a student studying for finals. And just last week, one of the building’s main water pipes burst, causing flooding in multiple areas and creating an unpleasant smell throughout the whole facility. At times, it can feel like the building is bursting at the seams; it’s clear the UCen can no longer meet the needs of our current student population. What’s more, when set against the backdrop of UCSB’s growing student body, the building’s shortfalls become even more dire.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why the UCen Governance Board has facilitated a proposal to address this problem, a plan we’re calling “Our NewCen.” The goal of the “NewCen” proposal is to both expand the UCen to increase general-purpose student space such as study space and meeting rooms, but also to re-purpose parts of the UCen to meet student needs that aren’t currently fulfilled by existing campus resources.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we don’t act soon, future Gauchos will be putting money into a building that is potentially hazardous, but also isn’t able to adequately serve their needs.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As news about “Our NewCen” has made its way around campus, I think there’s been some confusion as to what the revenue generated from this fee would be used for. Lots of students have understood the buzz-phrase “UCen renovations” to be limited to cosmetic updates such as carpeting, paint, etc., but in reality, this project goes far beyond that. “Our NewCen” reimagines the UCen to be the central hub on campus, where students can access the services they need most, like the A.S. Food Bank, counseling and mental wellness, and tutoring and 24-hour study space.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fee referendum proposed by “Our NewCen” would begin in 2018 and calls for a $20 per quarter fee for the first four years, during which architects would be hired to collaborate with students, finalize the “NewCen’s” design, and determine how to put the concept into action. Once construction ends in 2022, the fee rises to $96 per quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this project does not begin now, the UCen will continue to be outdated, and UCSB students of the very near future will find themselves in an even more crowded environment than the one we currently find ourselves in. Furthermore, the UCen continues to deteriorate without renovation. Dangerous instances like the broken ceiling tile and burst water pipes will increase in both frequency and cost to students with the passing of time. This means that if we don’t act soon, future Gauchos will be putting money into a building that is potentially hazardous, but also isn’t able to adequately serve their needs. Much like past Gauchos voted for fee increases to fund the Rec Cen and SRB (facilities we all use and enjoy), we have the opportunity to make a similar decision for our future generations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will be graduating in the spring. Though this means I would be unaffected by the potential student fee increase, it also provides me a state of objectivity with regards to the project. Outside of the UCen Governance Board, I am not otherwise involved in student government, and will be leaving academia to pursue a career in a field unrelated to public policy or community projects. With that in mind, I will be voting to affirm this fee increase because I believe it will improve UCSB in a number of ways, and will prevent what would be an inevitable strain on future students and community spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether this year or in years to come, it’s undeniable that the UCen will require a major overhaul at some point. A project of this magnitude will only prove more urgent as the UCen deteriorates, and more expensive as time goes on. Ultimately, it is up to you, the student body, to weigh the costs and benefits and decide whether to fund a project for the future.

Despite starting in March as a joke, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has quickly blossomed into a movement. Be it our memes, our conversations, or our streets, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, (Spanish for raccoon), has taken UCSB by storm. The now infamous petition started by Infante, demands the retirement of the gaucho in favor of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and UCSB students were quick to agree. Gathering signatures by the bus load, the petition rapidly surpassed 2,400 signees in the span of a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, UCSB, then-known as Santa Barbara State College, championed the Roadrunners as its mascot. Gauchos back then were merely South American cowboys that wandered through the pampas and mountains of Argentina to Brazil. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in 1936, a student led effort dared to change that. Inspired by Douglas Fairbanks’s performance in the 1927 silent film, “The Gaucho,” students voted to change the mascot from the feeble Roadrunner, to something with a bit more grit, and thus the Gaucho was born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born from good intentions, the Gaucho mascot has been met with increasing scrutiny. Some argue UCSB’s use of the gaucho is cultural appropriation, while others claim the gaucho, or really Ole (sorry Ole), is just plain creepy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural appropriation is a sociological concept that describes a majority power taking elements from a minority power’s culture, and using them sacrilegiously and distastefully, typically in some caricature form. This usually occurs due to ignorance of the correct usage and meaning of the elements in question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, while cultural appropriation is normally some mild racial offense, it shouldn’t be confused with cultural exchange or assimilation. Cultural exchange is defined as one or more cultures sharing and adopting elements as a form of goodwill and understanding. In assimilation, we see the blending and mixing of cultures to form a larger one.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from simply redressing Ole to resemble a true gaucho, negating this whole mess, we could try something new. Retire the old gaucho and let the Mapaches take the reins.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either which way, it’s becoming increasingly evident that critics of the Gaucho mascot may have a point. In UCSB’s use of the gaucho, we find a man, Ole, with an unshaven face, a comically large handlebar mustache, a Zorro like mask and a giant unsettling grin all tucked beneath a sombrero and stuffed into an athletic jersey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the cultural appropriation definition, the sombrero and tacky mustache become difficult to justify when the rest of Ole is encased in modern clothes. This culminates with the failure to resemble even an ounce of a true gaucho at all. At this point it may as well be some mustache guy in a hat, so much so that calling this thing a gaucho is an insult to the true badass nature of the actual gaucho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put this in perspective, imagine USC stripped their famous Trojan down to basically the helmet and put it on some random guy, then earnestly championed him as if he were a member of the same fierce warriors of Troy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make matters worse, the complete disregard for the gaucho is intentional. Looking at UCSB’s athletic site we find everything that went wrong into creating our gaucho mascot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, we learn that Ole dawns his mask solely as a reference to the “Phantom of the Dome,” a masked man that riled UCSB sports crowds during the ’90s, and not as a reference to any kind of gaucho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, Ole doesn’t look up to Fairbank’s character, nor any actual gaucho at all. No, all that Ole personally aspires to be is Gaucho Joe, and the Phantom of the Dome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the icing on the cake comes from Ole’s implication of immigration status, as Ole refuses to state his date of birth, as it’s on the IRS to find out. Such implications are distasteful and insensitive, especially with the uncertain futures many undocumented immigrants face in our current political climate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from simply redressing Ole to resemble a true gaucho, negating this whole mess, we could try something new. Retire the old gaucho and let the Mapaches take the reins.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mere possibility of being a Mapache inspires pride that I didn’t know UCSB students could possess. It gives us a glimmer of hope that one day we wouldn’t have to explain our mascot to anyone else ever again.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raccoons have been an integral part of Isla Vista’s culture, myths and history. Be it their daily interactions with our roofs, streets or the trash cans, the infamous trash bandits can be found foraging for their next meal or just having fun. Like UCSB students, the furry critters are creatures of honor, nobility and cleverness. While in droves, they are akin to the swaths of students that wander back and forth through campus each day. In legends, the albino raccoon wanders through the streets of I.V. and is said to be an omen of wisdom and light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s more, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapaches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just seem to connect with UCSB students. Taking a look at UCSB’s meme page, you’d be hard pressed to find many posts that doesn’t have some mention of the mapache. From just this week alone the use of mapache has skyrocketed on both Facebook and Google’s search engine. Even further, the mere mention of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a group of UCSB students excites them. The mere possibility of being a Mapache inspires pride that I didn’t know UCSB students could possess. It gives us a glimmer of hope that one day we wouldn’t have to explain our mascot to anyone else ever again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the adoption of the Mapache mascot doesn’t mean the end of any of UCSB’s time-honored traditions. If anything, it would just justify them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, tortilla throwing, a cherished UCSB tradition, makes no sense from a gaucho’s point of view, (why waste food?) while it does from a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Throwing of the tortillas means more food for our beloved trash pandas. Likewise, the chants that UCSB students stammer don’t have to end either. Substituting “Mapache” in place of “Gaucho” seems to have little to no effect on either the meaning nor the rhyme of the chant. Taking things from a logistics perspective, all things considered, this transition could happen easily, and swiftly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From petitions, to designs, to excitement, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wholeheartedly encapsulates everything that is the fighting spirit of UCSB. So much so, that some students excitedly took the mapache moniker with pride. As such, it is without question, that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is of worth to champion UCSB and its students.</span></p>\n<p><em>Kekai ‘O Kalani Akita wants our favorite furry friends to be elevated to the mascot status they deserve.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dogs, like humans — like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animals — experience love and happiness, loneliness and fear, pain and suffering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, every year, over 70 billion animals are raised and slaughtered in ways that would bring any human being with an ounce of compassion in their soul to tears.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On factory farms, cows, pigs and chickens are crammed into filthy feedlots and injected with hormones, stimulants and antibiotics. Many of these animals are fed “renders,” which can range anywhere from dead and ground up cows to diseased animals, roadkill and euthanized pets instead of proper meals.  They live out their short lives bloodied, battered, breathing in toxic fumes, covered in sores and unable to move an inch, until they finally wind up as the ground beef for your Tuesday night tacos or the chicken nuggets you just ate for lunch. When I was younger, my family and I had the urge to save a hummingbird from dying outside in the cold, while also continuing to eat chicken for dinner. Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others? We are conditioned at a young age to believe that cows, pigs, chickens, sheep and fish are somehow lesser than the dogs, cats, bunnies and horses that we love so dearly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ignorance, apathy and hypocrisy of humans all sustain this unsustainable lifestyle of factory farming. In addition to the ethical immorality, consuming animals also has drastic ramifications for our planet. While 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions is due to transportation, including road, rail, air and marine, a whopping 51 percent is due to breeding livestock and their byproducts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, carpooling instead of driving solo, biking to and from work and even cutting down driving won’t be enough to save us, although doing all of these are still beneficial. In the United States, 55 percent of our water use goes toward animal agriculture, whereas five percent of water use is domestic or used for drinking, showering, washing dishes, etc. Consequently, shortening our showers and fixing leaky plumbing only saves a drop or two in the bucket. As if the effects of this industry weren’t already concerning enough, every minute, the animals bred for food produce seven million pounds of excrement. Lovely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with these facts, you still might remain apathetic to the detrimental effects animal agriculture has on the environment — it’s not like we only have one life-sustaining planet or anything. Climate change, water use, deforestation, species extinction, fisheries, land use and waste — all of these are severely affected by animal agriculture, whether we want to acknowledge our harsh reality or not. Every second, animals die and the earth pays for our ignorance, delusion and indifference. With billions of us consuming meat daily, the implications are frightening. Every day, we hear snippets of the environmental disaster surrounding us: Species of animals and plants are rapidly becoming extinct.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of ocean dead zones is increasing. Every day, we have the choice to turn a blind eye or to do something. The excuse, “I’m just one person. What difference can I make?” just won’t cut it anymore. When the production of one hamburger patty requires 660 gallons of water — the equivalent of showering for two months — the impact each individual person has is huge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is hope. An entirely plant-based diet reduces your carbon footprint by 50 percent, but even consciously making the effort to reduce our meat intake makes a substantial difference. Although the ultimate, sustainable goal would be for everyone to become vegan, I’m taking baby steps. By removing animals from my menu, I’ve already come a long way from being the girl who posted a picture of her In-N-Out cheeseburger on Instagram a few years ago with the profound caption, “Wow” and the heart-eye emoji. After nearly a year and a half of being vegetarian, I can definitely say the change was worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. Start reducing the amount of animal products in your diet. Then, make the choice to remove them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having compassion for animals is better for the animals. It’s better for your body. It’s better for your soul. It’s better for the environment. Having compassion for animals is better for the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Calista Liu wants everyone to consider the ethical consequences of meat-eating.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Plant-Based Privilege: Why Veganism Needs a New Approach</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PETA.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published an article entitled “Top 10 Reasons to Go Vegan in the New Year.” Nestled between valid reasons like “save the planet” and “help feed the world” was this: “All the cool kids are doing it,” followed by a list of high-profile celebrities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name-dropping those who “regularly appear in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine” is usually a failsafe marketing strategy. When it comes to veganism, however, this method is counterproductive. It makes veganism seem pretentious, undermining its personal benefits and positive impact. Worse, it contributes to the misconception that this lifestyle is only for the wealthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, veganism is a privilege that not everyone can afford. Being able to subsist comfortably on an animal-free diet is only possible with sufficient time and money. Poor people are never included in conversations about going meatless and eating green. Those who say “anyone can go vegan” are turning a blind eye to classism, poverty and how the meat industry profits off of both.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason why going full herbivore is called “converting.” Most people find the transition difficult because their favorite foods contain butter, eggs or milk. Ingredients like soy, rice, almond and coconut are popular substitutes for the real thing. They make the switch not just tolerable, but enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re also significantly more expensive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writer Antonia Noori Farzan published an article about the cost of these alternative products. Over the course of a month, she compared the prices of her purchases to their non-vegan counterparts. In total, eating vegan costs her roughly $100 a month. If you’re a member of the middle class, that’s pricey. If you’re one of the 40 million Americans making minimum wage, that’s unthinkable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veganism, however, is about more than paying for food — it’s also about having the time to prepare it. Vegan or not, home-cooked meals are both labor- and time-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with meat and dairy substitutes (whose absence would “take the joy out of eating”), cooking made it easier for fellow Gaucho Lily Garcia-Daly to convert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really lucky to have a family that supported my lifestyle change. Not everyone has a mom who would buy them almond milk in addition to normal milk for the rest of the fam[sic]. Not only did she encourage me to make my own meals, but she also made plant-based meals for my non-vegan family,” Garcia-Daly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet. Some parents work multiple jobs or round-the-clock shifts to support their families. This leaves little time for stewing lentils or grilling tofu burgers. Even if cost wasn’t an issue, there’s no vegan equivalent of McDonald’s or KFC. Vegan options at fast food establishments are nonexistent, unless you count french fries. Even so, fast food is unhealthy and unsustainably grown, fundamentally clashing with vegan values.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, fast food is the only option for those living in extreme poverty. While they aren’t America’s largest consumers of fast food, poor people are preyed upon by the industry more than other members of society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the result of “food deserts,” which the fast food industry helped to create. Food deserts are low-income neighborhoods in which healthy and affordable food is scarce. In these same neighborhoods, Wendy’s and Taco Bells flourish on every corner. The multi-billion-dollar meat, agriculture and fast food industries collude to make their products cheap and easily accessible. As a result, obesity is rising in low-income areas and has surpassed smoking as a leading cause of death. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These industries work together to trap the marginalized in a vicious cycle of poverty. The fast food industry is one of the most unequal industries in the U.S. While their CEOs are among the highest paid, their employees are by far the lowest paid. The meat and agriculture industries pocket an enormous profit from overworking and underpaying their employees. Many of these laborers are undocumented immigrants with no other employment opportunities. Fast food corporations profit as well, exploiting their workers and selling their labor back to them in the form of hamburgers and chicken nuggets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these industries have the lower class right where they want it: on both sides of the counter. There is no place for veganism in the struggle to survive on minimum wage. It’s not even a topic of conversation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, claiming that veganism is universally accessible is ignorant. Preaching that veganism is morally superior is similarly inconsiderate. The implication that anyone who doesn’t convert doesn’t care about the earth vilifies the underprivileged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More importantly, it distracts people from the task at hand: finding solutions. The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong. Budget, schedule and family size also need to be taken into consideration. Veganism’s mission goes beyond winning over individuals — it involves tackling the intertwined injustices of the immigration system, poverty and the meat industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than imposing judgment, advocates of veganism should focus on education and activism. There are also smaller-scale fixes. Vegans can encourage people to cut down on food waste and meat consumption, buy locally if they can afford it and teach people how to do their best with limited resources. The food industries may be rich and powerful, but there are still opportunities to affect change through individual action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, a plant-based diet is doable for most Americans. Protein sources like meat and dairy can be swapped out for beans, nuts and grains without additional cost. But to realize the vision of a sustainable food economy, veganism must be presented as more accessible and less elite. Otherwise, meat-eaters who can afford to convert will feel discouraged from doing so. Those who cannot will be left out of the conversation entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time you hear someone say, “Everyone could go vegan if they wanted to,” challenge them to consider who they mean by “everyone” and who they’re leaving out.</span></p>\n<p><em>Harper Lambert brings up the issues of making veganism a trend.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.

I realized that while high schools fail to provide an adequate foundation for sexual education, universities do little to fix the damage. I contemplated what my high school did wrong and asked myself: what should UCSB  do to ensure that its students receive a comprehensive sexual health education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended an incredibly liberal private high school in the heart of Silicon Valley. While the school excelled in many ways and prepared us to succeed academically, they failed to prepare us for living as individuals in society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our required sex ed class took place during freshman year. It was a quarter long class that met  once a week for fifty minutes. Because of its bland and unengaged delivery, its lack of both general information and specifics and its decision not to hold us accountable for retaining the material, it was clear this would be a slack-off class. My fellow 14 and 15 year old classmates either used the class to frantically study for upcoming tests, zone out and take a much needed mental break, or hang out with friends and make crude jokes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of classes that we had to suffer through in school that were beyond boring. Even in classes with lifeless, passionless teachers, we were forced to be engaged. We were constantly cold-called, tested and asked to turn in assignments that prove our understanding. Zoning out, talking and working on material or studying for another class was actively prohibited. However, all of these actions were rampant in our sex ed course. So why was this all allowed to take place? Why were the sex ed class standards so different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it’s pretty clear. My school did not emphasize its importance as much as other subjects we studied. Literally every single class that students were required to take had some sort of testing system to ensure that students were actually learning the material. That is, every class except for sex ed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew the class was a joke, but it wasn’t until the beginning of my senior year that I realized how pathetic it really was. During my free period, my friend told a group of us that she finally got an IUD. She was super happy about it and recommended it to all of us. She said that, besides its obvious use to protect against pregnancy, it basically stopped her period and cleared her skin. The two girls I was sitting with responded by asking, “wait, what’s an IUD?” They were unaware of other contraceptives besides condoms and birth control pills, so they resorted to birth control — despite the negative physical reactions. Because their knowledge of contraceptives, like various IUDs or the NuvaRing, was sparse, the girls relied on their peers for sexual health information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girls peppered the IUD-bearer with a multitude of questions, reinforcing the nationwide trend of teens relying on other teens and the media to educate themselves and make up for their lack of a formal sexual education. This kind of behavior stems from poor education and leads to false rumors and facts. One example of these harmful rumors is Plan B does not work after you’ve taken it three times. Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I was shocked at the pure illiteracy of some of my peers when it came to basic sexual health and anatomy. I came to this realization during a conversation that took place in DLG at the beginning of my freshman year. My friend mentioned that her boyfriend had just gotten tested and that we should get tested, just to make sure. One girl stated that she didn’t need to get tested because she would be able to tell if she had one. What she did not understand is that many STIs are often asymptomatic. Another girl responded that she did not need to get tested because she only blows people. What she and many others fail to understand is that STIs can be transmitted through oral sex, even if you spit, and through pre-ejaculate via oral or vaginal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, their comments may just seem like pure ignorance or stupidity, but, when assessing the potential consequences of their actions or lack of actions, it reflects a public health concern. These girls’ lack of education is a reason why STIs are spreading. Even though we are in a time of incredibly modernized medicine, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections are at a record high. In fact, Chlamydia accounts for the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC states that, “one in two sexually active persons will contract an STI by age 25.” Why is this? Well, only about 12% of young people were tested in the last year (CDC), so people continue to spread them through unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STIs are not just a nuisance. They have lasting effects with grave consequences. New strains of STIs emerge every year that are becoming harder and harder to treat. The CDC estimates that, “nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year in this country”. One recent infection that has garnered attention is Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea. This strain is resistant to our current antibiotics, making it much harder to treat — sometimes impossible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it important that you treat STIs? Well, they can result in serious damage with lasting effects later in life. For instance, the CDC estimates that “undiagnosed STIs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.” Women are potentially made infertile if Chlamydia evolves into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, which is often a sign of carelessness as a result of a poor education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, there are a lot of great resources and information that UCSB provides to its students surrounding sexual health. However, most students are not taking advantage of these resources, even when they are in need of educating. So, what should UCSB be doing for its students to ensure that we all receive an acceptable sexual education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thought is to have a required online course, similar to that of sexual assault and drug and alcohol education course. However, the issue with these courses is that they are easy to skip through which makes it rather easy to not actually learn any of the information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea would be to make it a GE requirement to take a course similar to the Baldwins’ highly regarded Sociology of Human Sexuality course. The course covers topics such as abortion, birth control, emergency contraception, Planned Parenthood, STIs, domestic violence, and UCSB sex culture and statistics. It is not only one of the longest running classes taught in the history of UCSB, it is one of the most popular. The popularity of this class and the increase in STI testing directly after the STI lecture reveals that students are not only uninformed, but they also want to gain a better understanding of the subject. Requiring students to take this class, or a class with similar content, would serve the student body well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health. It should be more heavily integrated into university curriculums because college is meant not only to give degrees, but to prepare us for the future as informed citizens of the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Claire Horsley wants to ensure that Gauchos are as educated in the bedroom as they are in the classroom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

orifices, whether it be their finger up their nose, their hand into a dark hole in the public bathroom wall or, in this case, a phallic object up their buttholes. Lucky for us, the last one tends to feel pretty good, granted it’s done conscientiously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never had the desire to stick something up your ass? Well, hopefully after you read this article, you’ll be a bit more open-minded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, while butt play can feel good to just about anybody, those with male anatomy have the pleasure advantage here. About 2.5-3 inches up their booty, men have this glorious thing called the prostate. No, it’s not just there to potentially give people life-threatening cancer; in fact, the prostate is a magical organ that can provide men with a type of bliss that’s hard to match.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, guys, you might be telling yourselves that it’s “gay” to put stuff up your butt in a sexual way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m here to say, “Nope! Not gay at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you attracted to other men? If you answered yes, then okay, yeah, you might be gay. However, if you answered with a resounding no, then you’re not gay, you’re just curious what a dildo might feel like stuffed up your anal canal. The act of fucking yourself in the ass isn’t what’s gay — rather, it’s the attraction to who is doing the fucking.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time I suggested butt play to my current partner, he agreed because it seemed like something I really wanted to do, not because he thought it would feel good. That opinion changed pretty quickly after I slipped a finger into his ass while giving the most enthusiastic blowjob I’ve ever performed. After a bit more stimulation, he came from fellatio for the second time in his life, so it’s safe to say he was probably into it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was even better next time when I got further in and found his prostate. I knew I had struck sex gold when I started massaging the smooth, stiff, spherical lump that lives up there and my guy’s eyes rolled into the back of his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He came to when he thought he felt like he was going to pee. Instead, he began leaking an insane amount of pre-cum. Like, it was a small stream flowing down his dick onto his stomach. He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this session, both of us realized a few things: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) My fingers were too short and his ass was too tight for me to really get up there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) We both wanted to take this much further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, we talked about it and decided to implement some toys into this new pastime of ours. The existence of toys was not new to us, but, thus far, they’d only been stuck into me. Because it was known by both of us that I was more well-versed in sexual safety and just sexual knowledge in general (thank you, r/sex), Boy trusted me with obtaining the first pocket rocket to enter his butt.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that looking for an ass dildo was going to be different than looking for a pussy dildo for a few reasons. First off, assholes tend to be much tighter than vaginas, so preparation and build-up was going to take longer. This meant that I had to start small and go from there so I didn’t make his butthole a buttchasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, the shape of the new object needed to be unique so that the prostate would be adequately stimulated. After all, that’s the whole reason we’re doing this. So I started looking at dildos that had a slight curve to them, as suggested by my online research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I looked for something with a smooth texture for easy insertion. I settled on a glass dildo from Amazon for $10 that’s about seven inches long and 1.5 inches in circumference. It has anal beads on one side and a pointed tip on the other for maximum pleasure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I wasn’t planning on letting go while doing the deed, I wasn’t too concerned with finding an ass dildo with a base flare — something commonly suggested to keep shit from getting stuck up there without a way out. My subsequent purchases are definitely going to have a base, though, because I underestimated the slipperiness of lube on glass. Nothing got lost, but it was definitely hard to maintain a stable grip while thrusting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you, that thing is magical. It had Boy begging me to fuck harder, and afterward he said he almost came from just that nearly three times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He reported that his dick was “sore from being so hard,” but he also said that wasn’t a bad thing. Apparently, the orgasm from a mixture of him fucking me and the dildo in his ass was much more intense than a normal one. He described it as an orgasm he would have after not cumming for a week or so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me. The next thing on our list is a legitimate strap-on that I’ll use to peg him, which honestly shocked me a bit because I wasn’t even the one to suggest it. I thought we’d go about this process in small increments, maybe a butt plug here and there, but I definitely did not ever picture myself full-on pegging him. Once he proposed it, though, I couldn’t think about anything else. I don’t think I’ll be able to until it actually comes to fruition (which will hopefully be soon).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll leave y’all with a compressed list of Dos and Don’ts in case reading this sparked some curiosity in you and you want to try your hand at sticking things in orifices:</span></p>\n<p><b>DO go slow.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like any muscle, the anus has to get warmed up before it gets positively rammed, and this can take a few days. That’s right: days. The act of relaxing enough to allow something up your butt takes a while to master, so try incorporating some mild ass play into the sexy times leading up to the big shebang. Also, the feeling of needing to poop might need some getting used to as well (that never really goes away).</span></p>\n<p><b>DO use lots of lube.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Again, assholes are tight. You’re gonna need something to help ease the dildo in there, and lube kinda exists to do that. Make sure you use the right lube, though. Silicone-based lube should never be used with silicone toys because it compromises the integrity of the toy’s structure. Also, oil-based lubes shouldn’t be used with safer sex barriers (i.e. condoms) because those will also deteriorate and can have serious consequences. Water-based lube tends to be the least problematic, but do look into the pros and cons of each type of lube before you get some.</span></p>\n<p><b>DON’T kinkshame!!!!</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you partner asks you if you guys could try this out, don’t freak out and make them feel bad about themselves. I’m not saying you should do it if you don’t want to, but be understanding and calmly explain that you’re not interested. You don’t have to be a dickwad about it.</span></p>\n<p><em>Roxie Night wants you to be safe and open-minded when experimenting with new things.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/","id":6295,"author":{"id":644,"name":"Roxie Night"},"related":[6294,6293,6292],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/opinion","page":10,"highestPage":59}},"__N_SSG":true}
