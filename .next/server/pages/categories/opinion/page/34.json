He’s walking around in nothing but tighty-whities. My dad has curly chest hair, untrimmed arm pit hair and little hairs growing in random places along his back. To this day I will only fool around with a man who wears boxers or boxer briefs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’ll take one available man with a steady job that he likes and a side of lighthearted personality.</em></p>\n<p>I am 10 years old and I’m at the beach with my mom. I see a man with hair all over his chest and back. He’s sitting with his wife and two kids. He looks like a gorilla.</p>\n<p>“Mom, how could that man be married and have kids when he’s so hairy?”</p>\n<p>“He’s the alpha male.”</p>\n<p>“What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“You know, like the ape who is the leader of the pack. He’s a provider and a protector.”</p>\n<p>I felt scared for what the future held for me. Of course I want a man who can take care of me but is that really what I have to look forward to? An ape-like husband?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Can I substitute the commitment issues with knowledge in world affairs?</em></p>\n<p>I am 19 and I’m fooling around with Craig. We are in his bed and he’s on top of me. He sits up for a second to take off his shirt. Oh… my… God. I become hesitant of fooling around with any new guy because I’m afraid of what’s under his shirt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I would also like a glass of Sexy.</em></p>\n<p><em>White, brown or black?</em></p>\n<p><em>Surprise me.</em></p>\n<p>I am 20 and an actor I have a crush on walks into Whole Foods Market while I’m working. He asks me about vegetable powders and then he asks me out. I am about to say yes when I look down and see that he has spider legs trying to crawl out of the collar of his shirt. I turn him down and go out with a hairless idiot instead. I start to worry that I may miss out on a good man because I can’t get over my dislike of too much chest hair.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’d like to add something to my order.</em></p>\n<p>I’m 24 and I’m meeting Kevin for the first time. He is an alpha male. His stance is strong and confident but relaxed. His clothes portray the amount of money he has. He speaks intelligently. I feel this strong urge to have sex with him and carry his child, but not because I feel as though I met the love of my life. I guess it’s just that strange natural selection thing. What are these feelings? Do I really like this man or do I feel sexually attracted to him because I know that he can impregnate me very easily? I reach out to shake his hand and see the hair on his knuckles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Can you 86 the hair, please?</em></p>\n<p>I won’t go out with a guy who ties his sweater around his shoulders or wears pants so baggy it looks like he took a shit in them. But when I think about the deal breakers that I hold, most of them involve hair. I don’t want a Robin Williams where he’s got so much hair it’s even growing on his hands. A messy poof of hair on his head is out of the question. When I hug a guy with hair like that it feels like I’m putting my face into a gigantic bush of pubic hair. It’s chest, back and butt hair that really gets to me though. I can deal with a little happy trail but the thought of being underneath a man and running my fingers through his back hair is enough to make me gag.</p>\n<p>Too much hair does not go with the kind of sex life I enjoy. How am I supposed to lick whip cream and chocolate syrup off of a man without it getting stuck in his hair? I can just imagine myself having to stop in the middle of what I’m doing so I can cough up a hair ball. I don’t even want to feel a man’s facial hair when he’s kissing my body and especially not when he’s eating me out.</p>\n<p>I don’t ever want to be a housewife. I can provide for myself. I just want to feel secure in the fact that the man I am with will be there for me. I want an alpha male but why do they have to come with so much hair?</p>\n<p><em>Tessa Cole is a fourth-year art major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-20/ill-hairless-alpha-male/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-20/ill-hairless-alpha-male/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-20/ill-hairless-alpha-male/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-20/ill-hairless-alpha-male/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-20/ill-hairless-alpha-male/","id":6123,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6122,6121,6120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cosmo Tips: Tried and True, or Truly Terrifying?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In “Legally Blonde,” Elle Woods refers to Cosmo as “the Bible.” While Cosmo did give me step-by-step instructions on how to give my first blowie, I don’t think I’d quite put it up there ne...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In “Legally Blonde,” Elle Woods refers to Cosmo as “the Bible.” While Cosmo did give me step-by-step instructions on how to give my first blowie, I don’t think I’d quite put it up there next to the Lord.</p>\n<p>If Cosmo is your sole source of sex tips, then I want you to curl up the magazine and gag yourself with it real quick — and not just for pleasure.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: I don’t hate Cosmo.

Got the sexy cop thing goin’ on. Well, I don’t know what kind of underwear Cosmo had in mind, but unless it was rope, there’s a pretty good chance your panties are going to rip. One hand went left, the other went right and R.I.P green lace undies. In theory it’s a good idea, but when you’re dodging an unexpected donkey punch to the face, it’s time to rethink your technique.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Number 2: When you’re at the bar, take off your thong and slip it into his hand.</p>\n<p>I wish that I would have practiced this before I went in for the big leagues. Do you know how hard it is to remove your underwear from your outfit, and do it in a subtle, discreet, sexy manner? Hah, let me enlighten you.</p>\n<p>I had a good plan, too. I was just going to casually slip them off while dancing and tuck them into his hand. After gettin’ low about six times in order to inch my skivvies down to my ankles, I realized I now had to get my feet out of the situation. Thirty seconds of dancing with your underwear around your ankles is like that awkward moment when you’re jacking it with your pants down and you hear Grandma on her way up the stairs. Yeah, mortifying.</p>\n<p>Once I successfully handed them off, the response? “Holy shit, are these yours?”</p>\n<p>“No, I just tore them off some other girl.”</p>\n<p>“Jesus, you’re the horniest girl I’ve ever met in my life.”</p>\n<p>I left him looking like the happiest deer-holding-a-thong-caught-in-headlights and bee-lined home. I think these might be things you’re supposed to do with your husband once you’ve reduced sex down to like, once every leap year, or if you’re down to get unnecessarily freaky with a stranger.</p>\n<p>Real quick side bar here. Imagine the tables turning and a guy removing his tighty-whities and handing them to you. Sexy immediately turns into sex offender. See you on the late night Sunday viewing of “To Catch a Predator.” Educational moment: double standards do go both ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Number 25: Wear neon underwear. It’s just plain awesome.</p>\n<p>Easy win here. Don’t mind if I do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alright, onto “Frisky Foreplay.” Give your man a massage without using your hands. Once he’s totally relaxed, rub your breasts against his penis and he’ll happily rise to the occasion.</p>\n<p>God Cosmo, it’s like you know me. I cheated a little, maybe. I did not discount fingernails here. That light stroke thing going on? #winning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be the Boss in Bed: Torture him playfully with your teasing.</p>\n<p>Go channel your inner Rihanna “S&amp;M” here. Yeah, you’re bad and perfectly good at it; sorry I’m not sorry. You can get all kinds of bat-shit crazy here, or just have a tickle fight on steroids.

I feel that I must commend Mr. Begakis for his eloquent letter and enthusiastic support of the OWS cause. It is very encouraging to see a member of the College Republicans rising above the usual partisan divides in support of this movement.</p>\n<p>Mr. Begakis’ ironic straw man attack on the protesters is clearly too outrageous to be believed: “mindless” “rabble-rousers,” “wastrels” and “drugged-out youths” who “exude hatred and jealousy.” Equally ridiculous is the lavish praise heaped on his archetypical Wall Street investor: a family man whose “heart aches over how … to honor his town, his country, his planet and his God.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Begakis is aware of his audience: college students, faculty and staff who indeed work very long hours and make personal sacrifices for the sake of our livelihood and dreams. Like Begakis’ fictional investor, we seek to improve the world through our work and ideas. As busy students and employees, we therefore recognize the absurdity of Begakis’ contrast between the honest, diligent investor and his ungrateful employees who supposedly “face no economic risk” and have “no moral dilemmas in their economic decisions.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Additionally, as we seek employment after graduation, we become acutely aware that many of the “jobs [provided] to thousands of men and women” by Begakis’ holy businessman are nonexistent or overseas. Furthermore, many of us are sufficiently well educated to recognize that the outsourcing of jobs and money is not purely economic, but also political. It is encouraged with loopholes written by corporately funded legislators and exasperated by the declining investment in education.</p>\n<p>In the pinnacle of irony, Begakis accuses the protesters of “[seeking] to legalize theft in order to subsidize their loathsome behavior,” when this is the very accusation made by the protesters themselves. Through the obvious absurdity of his if-by-whiskey arguments, it is clear that Begakis’ scathing criticism is actually meant for Wall Street, and in particular for the big banks who would have collapsed under their own greed but for taxpayer support.</p>\n<p>As president of the College Republicans, Mr. Begakis communicates an important and timely message with his letter. The nation’s partisan divides are largely artificial and serve to distract the nation from the deeper issues we must face. So as we head into an election year, let us heed Begakis’ call to focus not on political division, but on economic solutions that will keep the American Dream alive. And never should we call for silencing the voice of the people — be they Tea Partiers or OWS protesters — for democracy is nothing without the voices of the 99 percent.</p>\n<p>Daniel Ouellette is a fourth-year graduate student in the Physics Dept.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/democracy-voices-99-percent/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/democracy-voices-99-percent/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/democracy-voices-99-percent/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/democracy-voices-99-percent/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/democracy-voices-99-percent/","id":6125,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6124,6123,6122],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Selfish Protestors Unfairly Victimize the Honest Business Man","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Occupy Wall Street protesters are a mindless rabble of envious deadbeats.

When they aren’t doing drugs and breaking laws, they’re busy defecating on police cars and marching on the private homes of businessmen, who dedicate their lives to hard work, entrepreneurship and lawful citizenship. They exude hatred for and jealousy of the most honest and responsible members of our society. They wish to punish those who have done nothing but obey the law and plunder the wealth of those who have done nothing but skillfully utilize their talents.</p>\n<p>These rabble-rousers hate the businessman, the man who wakes up at 5 a.m. every morning and works until 9 p.m. six days a week, and only gets to see his lonely wife and precious son and daughter before sunrise as they sleep in bed. The man who risks his very livelihood and the livelihood of his family — his private savings and property, — putting it on the line every day to explore new business ventures. The man who is personally responsible for the success of a firm more complex and efficient than a government agency.</p>\n<p>This man’s heart aches over how to ensure that the actions of his company always honor his town, his country, his planet and his God. He provides jobs to thousands of men and women — employees who work half the time, face no personal economic risk, have no responsibility over other men, face no moral dilemmas in their economic decisions and get to come home at 5 p.m. to a smiling family.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He is proud of the wealth of his firm because he knows that his employees, his shareholders and the consumers of his ideas and products have all shared richly in his wealth. Indeed, he is certain that, by the sweat of his brow, he’s brought far more wealth to the world than what he receives in the measly bonus check sitting on his desk at home.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t think about that check much, other than what philanthropies, private schools, homeless shelters and local parishes he can give it away to, lest he dishonor his accomplishments by selfishly keeping it all to himself. And what he does have left he spends on his family, the education of his children and the health care of his elderly parents — the immigrant father who worked three menial jobs just to send him to college and the caring mother who taught him to always love God and love his neighbor as himself.</p>\n<p>When he comes home, his mind swirling over how to cut costs to avoid laying off more employees — one of whom he knows has cancer and can barely pay his home mortgage — he sees a mob of dirty, drugged-out youths climbing over the fence of his home, frightening his family and threatening to destroy his property.</p>\n<p>He notices that one of the kids is a college student at Harvard University and a beneficiary of a private scholarship that he funded through his firm’s unexpectedly high profits last year. He thought he saw potential in that kid. He was polite, went to church, obeyed his parents and wanted to start a business right out of college. Now reeking of alcohol and looking like a vagrant, the kid acts like a common criminal, demanding even more money for less work. What the businessman doesn’t know is that the kid’s professor is giving the kid extra credit for his participation in the protests.</p>\n<p>These wastrels stand against everything we treasure as Americans. They seek to destroy the very society that puts clothes on their back and food in their stomachs. They wield the very freedoms that their government protects in order to demand that the government rob the honest, hardworking man of his freedom. They seek to legalize theft in order to subsidize their loathsome behavior.</p>\n<p>They are counterrevolutionaries against the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and they must be discredited as such. The Occupy Wall Street crowd, and all the media and academic elites that support them, ought to be shunned by all decent Americans so that they may suffer the shame and stigmatization that their destructive ideology deserves.

I will point out that the reporter never contacted me to ask if these were indeed actions I have taken.</p>\n<p>I have never threatened to terminate anyone from employment in the 20 plus years that I have worked here. Several times in my career I have assisted students who start off as employees and then have a conflict of roles as they become officers in the organization. Those conflicts are generally resolved by finding a different student staff position within A.S. not in conflict with their student leadership position.</p>\n<p>It is also not true that “Under the direction of Marquez, A.S. Associate Director for Special Projects Denise Rinaldi threatened to exercise the permanent staff’s power to terminate student employees in an ultimatum … ” I did not make any threats. I did not say or suggest the employee would be “terminated.” I did not issue any ultimatums. My supervisor has supported my effort to resolve the conflict of roles, but has not directed me to take any of my actions.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I was in fact surprised that the student employee decided to choose resigning from Judicial Council rather than be reassigned to other work. During the summer, a fellow staff member informed me that the student employee was stepping down from taking Legislative Council minutes. This staff member had received the information from an executive officer.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I authorized an e-mail message to go out inviting other students to apply for the position. The student employee then called me and told me that after consulting with her parents, she instead wanted to continue taking Legislative Council minutes. In subsequent discussions, I offered alternatives, which were refused, and it was not until the morning of the first Legislative Council meeting that I was told she was going to resign from her position as Judicial Council Chair.</p>\n<p>I have no relation to Judicial Council and have no interest in interfering with the president’s appointments. To the contrary, I am happy to work with any student that is appointed to any position and have done so for many years. My responsibility is to ensure that my practices as a supervisor uphold the ethics expected by the university. Further, my responsibility is to the entire student body, not to a particular group of students holding office any particular year.</p>\n<p>I have let our student staff know of the appropriate procedures when a staff member has a grievance with their supervisor. I have also offered to work with campus ombudsman to help resolve any such issues.</p>\n<p>I am particularly concerned that the Nexus cites a student as being fearful of retaliation by me or other staff. The student has not brought these concerns to me or to my supervisor. It is a very serious allegation and maligns my character, something I do not take lightly.</p>\n<p>I am glad that students on the council wish to review employee rights. Our students have a wonderful reputation for standing up in support of staff on this campus.</p>\n<p>I would remind these students and the Daily Nexus that I am also an employee with rights and hope that I will be included and considered in this dialog.</p>\n<p><em>Denise Rinaldi is the Associate Director for Special Projects for Associated Students.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41905\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-14/employee-explains-events-expresses-frustration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41905\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-14/employee-explains-events-expresses-frustration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-14/employee-explains-events-expresses-frustration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-14/employee-explains-events-expresses-frustration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-14/employee-explains-events-expresses-frustration/","id":6127,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6126,6125,6124],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Early Morning Stealth Fails, Awkwardness Prevails","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you haven’t had the sheer terror of waking up in a bed that’s not your own, with your first thought being, “I need to get the fuck out of here,” then you haven’t lived.

But, if you do successfully toot it and boot it, you sly dog you, make sure you have all of your stuff with you. If you end up getting back your forgotten items in the same state you left them in, consider yourself lucky. You were outta there faster than a midget in a dunk contest, and let’s face it, people don’t forget.</p>\n<p>You know, I don’t know what it is about bras, but they always end up in places they don’t belong: a kitchen cabinet, a tree. Sometimes their roommate will discover it and throw it out. That’s 40 bucks I’ll never see again, and it was yellow — so, yeah, that was a ray of sunshine I lost too.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, even a repeat hookup can still make you want to get away, maybe even more so, because of that. When morning sex is out of the question, and you really have nothing witty on hand to say, it is simply time to go. One and done, hit it and quit it, lay without pay, I could go on for days here. Lesson learned: don’t be a lingerer. But what exactly is proper morning after etiquette to assure you won’t be just that?</p>\n<p>Let’s face it, no one looks quite as good as they did the night before. It could be because the beer goggles are gone, but add that to the sex hair, running makeup and face creases from your pillow, and well, would you look at that. Shit just got real.</p>\n<p>No one can be bothered worrying about someone’s feelings when you look like you just got hit by the hangover bus. But, you know, you have to at least pretend. My go-to move was always to climb over the other (still sleeping) person, but it never worked. You know that saying, “They always come back?” Well, in this case, they always wake up. I’ll be naked in broad daylight looking for my clothes when they happen to catch me.</p>\n<p>God, you know? That awkward moment when you’re bent in half gathering your items, and peek back just to make sure you didn’t make the worst mistake of your life the night before, and they’re face down, ass up, making eye contact with you, wondering just the same.</p>\n<p>No, the worst possible thing that can happen is when the other person wakes up when you’re in the process of climbing, mid straddle. Let’s not beat around the bush here, no pun intended, one of you has morning wood, so either way you’re about two inches away from hitting up round two. It’s pretty much safe to say that whoever is waking up is down to work off their hangover rather than drowning it in Mexican food.</p>\n<p>Well, so far this has all been under the assumption that you didn’t bring the person home to your house, which is most definitely something to be considered. Welcome to the world of stage five clinger. There’s nothing worse than being trapped in your own house. Ditching this one? Lie, my friend, lie. Say your parents are coming, say you have to meet someone for breakfast, do what you gotta do, kid. You were smart enough to get into this school; you’re smart enough to gaucho ass outta there. (Sorry for being school spirited … go soccer).</p>\n<p>Anyway, just make sure you follow through with your lie. Don’t start gallivanting around I.V. because you will run into them. Seriously, it will happen. It’s Murphy’s Law or some shit. Look it up.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately if these two escape routes fail, no matter whose house you’re shackin’ at, it pretty much leaves you with talking. You can even use the opportunity to become best friends with their roommate. Or, casually insult him or her so that at least two out of the three people in the room want you to be gone.</p>\n<p>Really though, let’s not kid ourselves here, text a friend, have them call you and claim they left their keys at your house.

The irony of the information’s medium was not lost upon me or the Internet community. After the initial shock, understanding the meaning of Jobs’ life and work, which so dramatically shaped our generation’s relationship with technology, became incomprehensible. The Internet seemed the only recourse. Apple stated, “Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives.” Can his prescience, minimalism and ingenuity truly be eulogized in such a concise statement?</p>\n<p>By this point we probably have all been inundated with the narrative of Steve Jobs’ life, but it makes the details no less sensational. From his adoption to his precocious interest in computers at an early age, his Jobs’ life seemed linearly projected for greatness. He first brought us the Apple I, of such minimalist design it featured no display or keyboard, before ushering in the personal computer era with the unveiling of the Apple II in 1977. Following a 10-year forced sabbatical that started in 1985, Jobs returned to a floundering Apple Corporation in 1996 and unleashed innumerable devices that forever altered the technological landscape. Peaking with the 10-year run, starting in 2001, that birthed the iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad, Jobs propelled Apple to its perch atop the consumer peak it occupies today. It is impossible to overstate the material impact Jobs’ life has had on the contemporary world.</p>\n<p>Lost in the shuffle, though, are the qualities that made him so gifted or, rather, mercurial. It is our morbid fascination with death that compels us to impart value on the lives of the recently deceased. So, in passing, Steve Jobs becomes a headline, the trending topic of the day, before fading into the recesses of our brains as an icon, distant and unfamiliar. But that should be the fate of a lesser man, for Jobs left us more than products, provocative marketing campaigns and the largest publicly traded company in the world based on market capitalization.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Steve Job’s took his garage hobby and fundamentally re-envisioned the public’s relationship with capitalism. Apple products transmitted individuality, while, paradoxically, being available for mass consumption. Moreover, they connected technology with personal expression and creativity rather than the robotic efficiency that had come to signify our relationship with computers. Jobs gave us iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto among numerous other creative media that inspired many of today’s creative artists. Shit, the man gave us Pixar for crying out loud. Each movie: “Toy Story,”</p>\n<p>“Finding Nemo,” “Monsters Inc.” and onward, incrementally asked us to dream, to seek out adventure and to take solace in the fact that we are not alone, that the world can be a beautiful place.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs’ lasting legacy should not be the products he created, the wealth he earned or the company he left us, but rather how we perceive the world around us. A world fraught with opportunity, one in which we have the unique capacity to change it for the better. No quotes or respects paid can fully convey the enormity of his footprint in the world of today. But maybe, even in life, Jobs left us a way for understanding his death. From the 2005 Stanford Commencement speech he delivered:</p>\n<p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</p>\n<p>Jake Schurmeier is a fourth-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41715\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/steve-jobs-lasting-legacy-world-fraught-opportunity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41715\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/steve-jobs-lasting-legacy-world-fraught-opportunity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/steve-jobs-lasting-legacy-world-fraught-opportunity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/steve-jobs-lasting-legacy-world-fraught-opportunity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/steve-jobs-lasting-legacy-world-fraught-opportunity/","id":6153,"author":{"id":504,"name":"Jake Schurmeier"},"related":[6152,6151,6150],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In practice, this is an honor I share with the paper you are now reading. I commend what I sincerely hope is a good-faith effort on the part of this paper to provide a healthy dose of transparency to our association. Offering a clear and holistic picture of what is happening with our student government is imperative to the sense of ownership that students should have over A.S. and it should also keep accountable to this basic mission those of us who have been elected, appointed or hired to serve our undergraduates. Transparency and accountability are two values that I not only campaigned upon this past spring, but that I hold very dear to my service in this office.</p>\n<p>To this end, the recent coverage of A.S. has lacked an inside perspective aside from a handful of quotes that could never really paint a complete picture. This in turn, either intentionally or collaterally, has proven to target individuals in the public crosshairs without the benefit of their full story. My hope is simply to provide further clarification of issues that I encourage students to critically analyze and investigate of their own accord.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the front page of the Oct. 5, 2011, issue of the Daily Nexus, the emboldened headline “A.S. Faces Impending Legal Storm” next to an ominous sculpture of the acronym “A.S.” crumbling is more than a tad dramatic and potentially misleading.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The latter is true especially when placed adjacent to the article regarding the personal legal matters of a former Legislative Council representative. Believe what you will about that particular situation, but to think that it in any way brings about a “legal storm” upon our association is entirely untrue, plain and simple. If you are an undergraduate student who has paid your student fees, you are a member of A.S. and can enjoy all of our representation and programming including, but not limited to, A.S. Program Board concerts and representation by the Isla Vista Tenants Union. To say that if you or your fellow undergraduate has run into legal trouble, we as a student body are about to brave the risky seas of any “legal storm” exaggerates the implications of this individual’s personal life. That student will hopefully receive justice in the court of law and out of the court of public opinion. Though while serving as a representative he would absolutely have to face the latter, it has been almost five months since he resigned from office. He is no more a part of A.S. than the authors of these reports.</p>\n<p>The second matter is the three-part saga regarding an internal conflict in the association that involved student and permanent staff members. For everyone’s clarification, staff members (both student and career) are distinguished from students like me because they receive a salary or wage for the work completed, are officially employed by the UC Regents via the University (much like any other University-affiliated position) and are subject and entitled to certain rights and policies in that capacity. There are over 300 students and about 28 permanent staff members working to empower students and provide our numerous student services (including our Recycling Services Program, A.S. Publications, the Ticket Office, Emergency Loan Programs and the A.S. Food Bank just to name a few). The reality is this: We could not function without this remarkably dedicated team. The headline “A.S. Council Clashes With Permanent Staff” — on page three of the Daily Nexus Oct. 7, 2011, edition — inappropriately generalizes the permanent staff team that works pretty thanklessly for students every day. They are far from being paid anything most would consider exorbitant (Don’t believe me? Take a trip to sacbee.com/statepay, cheers to transparency!). Staff members do their jobs because they believe in the genuine power of student service and student representation. While it’s easy for involved students to see this daily, the characterization and large scale first impressions promulgated by this headline, in my opinion, need some context.</p>\n<p>This is not to say there has been no disagreement between student staff and permanent staff. In fact, I’m sure there has been plenty of disagreement between these groups as well as staff and other appointed and/or elected members of Associated Students and certainly within this latter group itself. Conflict is a reality of any working environment. The true distinction of a cohesive and productive organization is the ability to transcend the conflict and move toward resolution.</p>\n<p>This was a process in which we have been fully engaged. We have been working through every available avenue (including, but not limited to, mediation, discussion, etc.) with the presence of all parties involved to see this situation through to a solution for everyone. A newsworthy story might have appropriately surfaced had we exhausted all these channels to an egregious outcome, but we have yet to reach that point.</p>\n<p>My concern is that an exposé that has spanned four articles and seven pages of the last three issues of this publication has cast out the day-to-day benefits, services and work of the vast majority of our students and staff as well as other more newsworthy stories happening on campus and in our community.</p>\n<p>My hope is that this story has sparked within students a desire to demand a level of transparency and accountability consistent with a student government.

Excess. We have access to everything and anything, good and bad. You and I are the small fraction of humanity alive today that gets to live in a way that no person ever has before. It’s a time of relative prosperity, and for some reason this has people mad. They are angry about the choices other people are making, which seems like an eternal theme with America. They’ve taken up arms and said, “Enough is enough; we can’t let you go live your life the way you want.” They’re getting involved and they’re bringing the government with them.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering what I’m talking about. Drugs? Wealth? Sex? Biased media? Pauly Shore movies? Nope. I’m talking about fast food. We’ve entered the era of fast food demonetization — a decade grounded in perpetuating grayed-out stock footage featuring faceless obese Americans. When we can’t be mad about hippies, rock music, drugs, sexuality or punk music, we start grasping at straws. One of these straws just so happens to be the food we eat.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but it never seems like those demonizing fast food are living at the poverty line. They’re the “well to do” Whole Foods suburbanites with too much free time. They’re a leisure class that needs something simple and concrete to pick on. So here is my plea: have some compassion. Be a bit humble — if only for a second — and realize that for most people, fast food is the ONLY option. Is that optimal? No. But does it help at all to tax these people more? To stigmatize and berate them for the choices they make for themselves and their families? Any tax on fast food is in itself a tax on the poor. It’s an abridgment to the liberties of those less fortunate so that some silly utopian ideal can be upheld. It’s absurd, irresponsible and shortsighted. It’s elitist snobbery, plain and simple. It’s a way of giving local and immediate strife to others and meaning to our cushy existence. We are fighting morally bankrupt wars and digging our way out of economic crisis, but all the food police care about is how other people are living their lives. For that they should show some shame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is fast food good for you? Anti-fast-food activists claim we’ve entered an age of premature death, and its cause is fast food. That makes for a good headline, but, according to the CDC’s report on life expectancy titled “Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2007,” “A baby born in 2007 has the highest life expectancy in the history of the United States.” That’s it, plain and simple; we live in a time where everything is better than it has ever been, but no one really wants to admit that. There isn’t any hard data correlating the success of fast food companies with premature fatality in anyone. It’s just not there. However, let’s say fast food is killing people. Let’s say we can find proof that fast food kills. We are adults making our own decisions about how we live. And that’s it in a nutshell. Fighting fast food is fighting freedom; they are ideals that are one in the same.</p>\n<p>So maybe fast food isn’t killing us, but it’s addictive, right? They’re out to get us with food high in salt, sugar and fat so we have no choice but to come back and eat. Well, do you know what tastes good? Salt, sugar and fat. Saying it’s a fast food company’s responsibility to keep us healthy is absurd. They make food that tastes good, so why exactly are we mad? Oh, an obesity crisis? Let’s just outline this. Fast food companies make food that we want to eat, so some of us eat too much — completely willingly — and get fat. Now we’re saying the government needs to step in and dissuade us? Does anyone else see how this is absurd? Blaming fast food for making people fat is like blaming video game companies for making me vitamin D-deficient. We all live in a place where we can partake in everything to any excess so long as it doesn’t harm anyone else; it is our right. Any restriction to what we consume is an affront to the ideals of freedom and liberty and should be treated as such.</p>\n<p>These same fast food fighters are lobbying to pass a soda tax, which would tax the purchase of sugar-based drink products. Here’s the problem with a soda tax: According to the Environmental Working Group, our government spends $3,519,507,154 subsidizing corn. That’s 3.5 billion dollars of OUR money spent to make farmers grow corn. That corn is then converted into high fructose corn syrup, which is used in our sugar drinks. Our tax money makes soda dirt cheap. Now the anti-fast-food crusaders want to tax this soda? We are getting screwed at both ends on this deal. We’re paying to make the soda, then paying extra for the “right” to consume it. This tax won’t stop people from consuming soda, it will just make it more expensive. It is a futile dieting flail from hardcore fast-food reformists. It’s social engineering, plain and simple. You can’t legislate people into wanting and not wanting something. It has never worked and it never will.</p>\n<p>On July 30, 2008, the Los Angeles City Council passed a ban on establishing new fast food restaurants in low-income areas. On that day, the City Council decided their knowledge of social welfare superseded that of the free market’s ability to promote businesses that provided desired goods and services. On July 30, citizens of L.A. lost a lot of freedom, and we should be ashamed of that. They lost their liberty for the sake of someone else’s misguided activism. Do you think those who relied on fast food to feed their families wanted this reform? This abuse of power goes to show the dangerous precipice social engineering teeters on. It is reactionary and absurd to try to legislate the personal decisions people make in order to get by.</p>\n<p>Numbers don’t matter because it’s all about this very simple question: “Should our government have any control over what we, as consenting adults, put into our bodies?” Exercise your right to eat what you want, and don’t tell other people how to take care of themselves. Anything else is garbage.</p>\n<p><em>Ian Davis is a first-year English major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/","id":6152,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6151,6150,6149],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“No-Otter” Zone Stunts Population, Prompts Public Hearing","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Have you ever been to Monterey or Santa Cruz and seen those cute little otters hanging out near the beach?

I have and, until recently, I never thought twice about why we don’t see otters like that in Santa Barbara or L.A.</p>\n<p>It turns out that although Southern sea otters are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, a “no-otter” zone is enforced between Point Conception and the U.S.- Mexico border. Established in 1987 through a Congressional exemption, this zone was an attempt to balance industry interests with the needs of a species. A number of otters are translocated (removed and relocated) from this zone and either brought north or put on San Nicolas Island as an experimental population.</p>\n<p>Such efforts have failed and the sea otter population is declining. We shouldn’t be limiting the natural habitat of this species by creating imaginary boundaries on its expansion. If anything, removing the “no-otter” zone would lead to population growth and eventually removal from the endangered species list.

They prevent sea urchin populations from booming and then destroying kelp forests, which in turn promotes biodiversity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There will be a hearing tonight from 5 to 8 p.m. at Fleischman Auditorium in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.

The article lays two charges against Warren’s argument for more social spending: that the government is not always benevolent and that privatizing public infrastructure and civil institutions maximizes their efficiency.</p>\n<p>The first contention is true but nonetheless a non sequitur. It is uncontestable that the federal government routinely and savagely tortures people, for example. However, criticism of government malfeasance does not imply that it should be inactive. The War on Terror is no excuse to end Medicare. Instead, a wise society seeks to mitigate the harms associated with the government while maximizing the benefits.</p>\n<p>The article’s second argument does directly address Warren’s message and rests on an economic assumption that would have Adam Smith spinning in his grave. It maintains that any service or product that is provided by the government can be more efficiently provided by a private entity. It supports this idea with a sloppy outline of the free market principles found in The Wealth of Nations. Unfortunately, this classic dropped off best sellers lists long ago and very few people actually read it. Many key points are forgotten and neglected when it is applied in modern contexts. Most importantly, Smith argues that decentralization of market power maximizes market efficiency — insulation from government influence is a means to that end, not the goal itself. A free market is not guaranteed by an absence of government regulation but rather by the diffusion of production and consumption over many competing and independent parties. The more complete this diffusion, the closer the market approaches the behavior of Smith’s free markets.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Tuesday’s opinion piece notes, private grade schools and high schools are often higher quality and more efficient than publicly-run equivalents; however, it neglects to mention that for-profit universities charge Ivy League rates for worthless degrees. The deciding difference between these two private education systems, according to Smith’s arguments, is that the former is often administered by small organizations while the latter is controlled by corporate titans. Another open secret in The Wealth of Nations is that Smith does not claim that private profit is always the best way to support the public good. Rather, he maintains that the government should administer such projects that cannot yield profit to any “small number of individuals” but “more than repay it to a great society.” He cites as examples services such as fire fighters and education and infrastructure projects like roads and bridges.</p>\n<p>The truth is that Smith was no ideological zealot though his intellectual corpus is often abused for such zealotry. The modern global economic environment scarcely resembles that of the 18th century and his arguments are often fallaciously extrapolated to support ideas that he vigorously opposed.

They basically made it impossible for most people to take them seriously because of their “joking” portrayal of the issue, which is a shame because they may have had valid points to make.</p>\n<p>That being said, I have to agree that race and gender should not be considered in college admissions. Ultimately, the only reason why someone should be admitted to any given college is their demonstration of a level of academic and intellectual ability on par with the standards of that college. Admitting students due to something like race, gender, athletic ability or socioeconomic level — even if they are not academically or intellectually qualified — lowers the standards of the college and forces the college to provide a less rigorous education for everyone, including those who are academically and intellectually qualified.</p>\n<p>College is not the place to start fixing the issue of minority misrepresentation in higher education. Focus needs to be put on improving grade school education so that minority children get a better education from the start, and are thus prepared for the academic rigor expected of them in college. If this were the case, there would be no need to consider their minority status at all, because they would get in on their own merit instead of something they have no control over.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is no easy task, but it is my opinion that striving for the best grade school education possible is the most important long-term issue our country currently faces.

I don’t remember much about that year (but that’s the subject of another column entirely—perhaps Memoirs of an Old Town Tavern Addict or Long Island Iced Tea For Dummies), but I do remember this: I would have paid for a chance to write The Wednesday Hump. Happily, I somehow tricked the editors into paying me with a little bit of money and the privilege to spend time in the beautiful Daily Nexus office.</p>\n<p>The day UCSB forced me to graduate was the worst day of my life. Not only were my friends and I thrust into the big bad world of jobs and close-toed shoes, but I no longer had an excuse to spend weekends conducting research for a sex column. (Mom, if you’re reading this, please mentally replace ‘sex’ with ‘relationship’ and, of course, immediately stop reading.) The summer after graduation was a dark time for me. There was a void where vibrating cock rings and weekly trips to The Adult Store had once been. But then I had an epiphany! I know, I thought. I’ll go to law school!</p>\n<p>What? You may be asking yourself what law school and The Adult Store could possibly have in common. Good question. You see, four years at UCSB had brainwashed me into thinking that people enjoy fun. In my law school fantasy, I would waltz into the administration office and charm the dean into granting me the first sex column a law school had ever seen. It would be called On the Bench or Under the Robe or some other vaguely suggestive courtroom reference. There was only one flaw in my master plan: law school is a serious place. So serious, in fact, that I never got the courage to propose my idea.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Actually, that’s not strictly true. I did propose it to a few of my classmates, but rather than starting a petition, my new friends simply Googled my name, started an e-mail chain with links to The Wednesday Hump and unwittingly ruined my already-slim chance of ever obtaining employment as a lawyer. I don’t know if you know this, but lawyers don’t like to hire people who once wrote an article about the most polite way to reject a threesome. Fair enough. I wouldn’t hire me, either.</p>\n<p>Although my hopes of becoming the Carrie Bradshaw of law school were dashed, I stayed because I was already there. Perhaps that’s not the best reason to commit three years of your life to something, but the rationale made sense in my 22-year-old mind. Also, Cosmo didn’t respond to my pathetic (or awesome —however you want to look at it) letter in which I pled for a job, a mailroom internship or anything that would get me out of law school and into the hallways of Hearst. So I finished law school. I graduated this past May and here I am, pleading with the editors of the Daily Nexus for the chance to write one more Wednesday Hump.</p>\n<p>To the three of you who are still reading, please, heed my advice: You have four (or three… or two… or one!) years to have innovative sex. Use them. As I’m sure your parents, siblings and older friends have told you, everything is better in college. Before your life becomes a clusterfuck of embarrassing job interviews, long-distance friendships and quarter-life crises, take pleasure — literally and figuratively — in your current state of freedom. Whether you’re in a relationship, playing the field, or enjoying a ‘complicated’ hook-up situation, make sure you partake in the things that become inappropriate the minute you graduate.</p>\n<p>Let me provide you with an example: My college boyfriend and I liked to break away from Friday night ragers to have sex on the stairs leading from the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive down to the beach. I’m sure we weren’t the only ones. In fact, there were nights the stairs were shared. I never considered it at the time, but those nights were fleeting. If I did that now, I would spend the entire night craning my neck to make sure nobody was watching. And if I attempted it in 10 years, I would probably break my neck.</p>\n<p>Aside from where you do it, embrace how you do it. My favorite Wednesday Hump research was for a column I wrote about ballcuzzis. Although the lucky guy and I later agreed that ballcuzzis sound better than they feel, sneaking into his parent’s kitchen to heat up a bowl of milk and find a straw was a novelty. If his parents had caught us then, they probably would have rolled their eyes. Now that we’re supposedly old enough to know better, both generations would be mortified.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Carpe diem. Forgive me if I’m wrong, but I believe that’s Latin for “grab a straw.”</p>\n<p><em>Dana Olsen will likely never be old enough to know better — and for that, the Nexus commends her.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/","id":6419,"author":{"id":490,"name":"Dana Olsen"},"related":[6418,6417,6416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proactive Chilean Students Create a Model for Californians","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"American newspapers consistently portray the student protests in Chile as negative.

A recent article in The Daily Californian (“UC students abroad notice the impact of recent unrest,” Aug. 17, 2011) included the following comments from Berkeley student Bonnie Tung: “We would go to class, and there would be no class,” and “Some of us live in downtown (Santiago) and have had to stay at friends’ places to avoid the tear gas in that area.”</p>\n<p>As an exchange student from UCSB in my second semester at a public university in Santiago, I view this as a wonderful and unique educational opportunity. Isn’t that the most important part of studying abroad — to experience a foreign culture? Otherwise, why not stay in the comfort zone of Santa Barbara, Davis or Berkeley? It is without doubt a historic time in Chilean history, and I am overjoyed to be lucky enough to witness it firsthand. I have been fortunate to learn more outside the classroom in Santiago than inside. Every Chilean — student, parent, professor or average citizen — is current on the student protests, whether they are in accordance with them or not. They give you a history lesson beginning with the pre-Pinochet era up to the present to explain the value Chileans have for democracy. They are an incredibly informed public, far more than the majority of Americans. Even sadder, the average Chilean probably knows more about American politics than half of the American public.</p>\n<p>The complaints printed in the The Daily Cal article are not even accurate. I know I can speak for most of the “viejos” (year-long EAP Chile students in our second semester) who were around when the strikes started, when I say that there was definitely an adjustment period, but we have now come to accept it. Oh, those Chileans! While studying in a foreign place, you will be adjusting and adapting daily to the new culture around you. This is just one more adjustment that comes with the territory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is it possible to study abroad in Santiago? Absolutely. Even though the Chilean students are on strike, foreign students still have an obligation to go to class, as do the professors, who are not officially on strike. The majority of the faculty is still holding classes specifically for exchange students. While there definitely were — and still are — nuisances in trying to arrange semester schedules, the directors of EAP Chile and the international relations offices at the universities here are working diligently to ensure that everyone has enough credits and classes to meet their educational goals. They have added the option of research or special studies projects working with a Chilean professor to make up for classes that may have been cancelled.</p>\n<p>And, compared to California, the class size can’t be beat. When was the last time all your classes contained just two to five students? We get to know our professors on a personal level and have more flexibility in the class. Open discussion is the norm, rather than lectures, making classes more interesting and creating an affable and supportive environment for those still learning to speak Spanish. I have really come to greatly appreciate these intimate seminars.</p>\n<p>UC students could learn a lesson from the Chilean youth. UC tuition has risen more than 40 percent in the last three years. When I started college in Fall 2008, tuition averaged about $7126/year. According to UCLA’s Financial Aid Dept., it now costs $12,685 per year for in-state tuition for a public university. What happened to affordable education for everyone? Our public education system has tanked, just like Chile. Due to budget cuts, classes are being cancelled, majors and minors are being dropped and crashing over-enrolled classes is now a way of life for most UC students.</p>\n<p>But the difference is that they are actually doing something about it. The student demonstrations continue to be all about providing an affordable (or free) quality education for every Chilean. So rather than complain about the annoyances caused by the protests, take advantage of this monumental time in Chilean history and live it! Take the inconveniences with a grain of salt.  Spend your time observing how students can democratically make a difference in improving the educational system that is letting them down. I’d say “Vale la pena” (“It is worth it”) to be here and experience history in the making!</p>\n<p><em>Elena Allen is a fourth-year UCSB student studying in Santiago, Chile, through EAP.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/","id":6163,"author":{"id":554,"name":"Elena Allen"},"related":[6162,6161,6160],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Governmental Taxation Undermines Its Own Aims","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Massachusetts senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren made big waves this week with a statement she gave regarding government services, taxation and the social contract.

You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn’t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”</p>\n<p>Warren correctly points out that people who operate businesses rely on the government to provide certain services, but I believe her assertion about an individual’s obligation to pay more in taxes is based on a narrow worldview that makes too many incorrect assumptions about the disposition and abilities of our government.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first thing we need to do when we talk about paying our fair share of taxes is to take off  Warren’s rose-tinted glasses and examine both the positive and negative things the government does with our tax money. Yes, Warren loves to tell us about how the government uses our income to fund education and infrastructure, but she conveniently forgets to mention that last year the government spent $663.7 billion (18.74 percent of the 2010 federal budget) of our taxes on the Department of Defense so we could operate 737 military installations across the globe and continue funding the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan for the seventh and ninth respective years. Similarly, the government continues to spend our tax dollars on the war on drugs, which it has been losing since 1971. Currently, the government spends billions of our tax dollars on the Environmental Protection Agency in an attempt to curb pollution, and then spends billions more to subsidize the oil industry that causes so much pollution in the first place.<br>\nThe message to take away from all this is that for every nice thing the government does with our tax dollars, it also does quite a few not-so-nice things. Yes, the government builds classrooms for kids, but it also builds holding cells in Guantanamo Bay. Yes, the government spends our tax dollars to police the streets and keep us safe, but the government also spends our tax dollars on the TSA so we can be groped for the sake of security while waiting in line at the airport. Yes, the federal government built the interstate highway system in the middle of the last century, but it also sent thousands of Japanese-Americans to internment camps. The next time Warren tells you it’s your societal obligation to pay your taxes forward, think long and hard about where your money will actually end up.</p>\n<p>But for the sake of argument, let’s pretend the government only spends our tax money on nice things like schools, roads and firefighters. All too often, we forget to ask ourselves if the government is actually any good at doing these things, and, if so, at what cost?</p>\n<p>Let’s talk education. It’s no secret that America’s public school system is not up to speed. It’s also no secret that America’s private schools largely outperform our public schools run by the government. Many say that this is because the public schools are under-funded and would perform much better if only they had deeper pockets, but a quick thought experiment quickly clears up this misconception. Imagine you had the choice of sending your hypothetical child to either a public school or a private school, on the condition that each school had the same amount of money to spend educating your child. Dollar for dollar, the private school always wins because the people who run the private school have a vested interest in doing their job well. In the private school, providing a top-notch education means more profits, whereas in the public school — where revenue is not dependent on the quality of the services rendered — it just means more work.</p>\n<p>Just as private schools outperform public schools, privately owned toll roads outperform pothole-ridden public roads because of the profit motive. Similarly, government operated police and fire units are easily replaced by volunteer organizations. In fact, volunteer fire departments have a special place in American history: Benjamin Franklin himself helped organize one of America’s first volunteer fire departments in Philadelphia. Volunteer police also exist in America in the form of neighborhood watch groups, the only cost of which is the time donated by their participants. (Yes, there are many important details as to how a volunteer police force would function, but that is in itself an article for another day.)</p>\n<p>As Warren’s words continue to reverberate in the media, we must remember that, at the end of the day, her goal is to get elected to the senate. And if that goal requires her to paint a fanciful picture of a competent, well-meaning government, it’s simply one more reason not to trust her — or anyone involved with the government, for that matter — with our hard-earned tax dollars.</p>\n<p><em>Dennis Wassem is a third-year economics major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41356\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41356\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/governmental-taxation-undermines-aims-2/","id":6159,"author":{"id":553,"name":"Dennis Wassem"},"related":[6158,6157,6156],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/opinion","page":34,"highestPage":59}},"__N_SSG":true}
