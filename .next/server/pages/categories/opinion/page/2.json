I also want to acknowledge that my upbringing and experiences do not reflect those of all Asian Americans and other people of color.

The degree in which I have personally felt racism from others has been, thankfully, small. I can attribute this to the facts that I was born in California, speak English and grew up in a predominantly white community. I learned at a young age the right way to fit in among my peers and how to properly be the “token” Asian friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re so white for an Asian, like a Twinkie!” (You know, white on the inside, yellow on the outside.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re the whitest Asian I know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such seemingly “harmless,” if not incredibly ignorant, comments extended beyond friends and peers describing my “whiteness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Your dad speaks English really well! He sounds so American.” That would be because he was born in Minnesota and grew up in California, speaking English as his first — and only — language. Did I mention he’s also American? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never realized your mom has such a heavy Asian accent,” the grown man said. He then proceeded to provide his best imitation of a stereotypical Asian accent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an immigrant who moved to America when she was 12 years old, my mother was experiencing the cultural shock of being in a new country and learning English as a second language. At this point in her life, her father had already passed away and her mother would pass away months after they moved to the United States. I was — and still am — incredibly proud of my mother for the trials she has overcome, a language barrier being one of them. Even before I fully understood what racism meant, I was still astonished, and inwardly cringing, that someone would make such an ignorant joke at the expense of my mom’s “heavy accent.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only after recently listening to Jiayang Fan, a staff writer at The New Yorker, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/podcasts/the-daily/racism-chinese-coronavirus-asian-americans.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak about her own story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an episode of “The Daily” podcast, did I recognize the “probational” nature of being Asian American. Would my experience be different if I was an immigrant? If my first language was Chinese or Vietnamese? If I didn’t have an American accent? If I didn’t understand English grammar and slang? Oh, absolutely. Even having a name like Calista, which originates from Greek, rather than a traditional Chinese or Vietnamese name, has factored into my experience as an Asian American.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in such uncertain times. The anxiety, loneliness and fear many Americans are feeling is completely valid. Like many others, I fear contracting the virus and the ramifications this would have for the family members I am sheltered with right now. And yet, many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault. Although I have not been a </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">target of racial slurs or hate crimes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the pandemic, I know the same cannot be said for others who look like me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Words have power. Whether it’s a racial slur yelled by a bigot or an ignorant joke made at the expense of a minority group, these words leave a lasting impression. The language President Donald Trump uses in regard to COVID-19 disregards the </span><a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Health Organization’s practices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of refraining from using geographic locations to name new infectious diseases in order “to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.” Such language, spoken by the president no less, allows for the continuation of racism and xenophobia in our country. The virus is not an excuse for racism. Fear itself is not an excuse. Ignorance is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no excuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although racism is a deep-rooted problem that the U.S. has carried throughout its history, there are still ways we can mitigate the pain and suffering it inflicts in our daily lives. Being conscious of the language we use and holding others accountable to do the same is a start. If you are in a position of privilege, then use that power to defend someone who is being targeted and be an advocate for the disenfranchised. At the very least, how about, just don’t be a racist? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am grateful for the opportunities I have had growing up as an American. I am proud to be half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. I hope to one day be proud of my country too.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu would like people to just stop being racist.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

At first, I was shocked. Although I knew what I was getting myself into when I announced my candidacy for EVPLA in yet another Associated Students election this past week, I did not expect the drama to get this toxic, or this personal. My brother attempted to make light of the situation: “Now you know what it’s like to have #haters,” he joked. But I couldn’t keep myself from refreshing the page, reading over and over again the dehumanizing words about my identity and experiences, looking through the profiles of the strangers who seemed to know me without ever trying. As I read lies and rumors about myself and my peers, the numbing ache in my stomach grew, but I was unable to tear my eyes away. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not like I’ve never received any sort of backlash before.

My parents and most of my family, like thousands of others, left Iran for fear of being persecuted as part of a Jewish minority when the Islamic regime violently came to power. I’m also white-passing, and I have publicly acknowledged the immense privilege I carry because of that. I deeply understand the harmful potentials of equating my experiences with those of other brown folks, experiences I will never truly know myself. I am a first-generation college student.

I will not be erased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, Jewish students have been speaking out about anti-Semitism and our experiences on this campus. Yet in my experience, we are often harassed, bullied and excluded from progressive spaces on campus for our beliefs. The author of the tweet does not know me and yet felt like it was appropriate to erase and dismiss every single thing about me. In their eyes, nothing — not my years of dedication to progressive causes, my personal experiences or struggles or any of the work I have done on this campus — none of that is valid because of their preconceived notions of who I am. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it’s the anonymous comments; or that at last year’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divestment resolution hearing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a former A.S.

I am not afraid to speak my truth about issues that are important to me, and I am putting myself out there to run this campaign. I knew that displaying vulnerability would open the door for attacks on my character. However, the rest of my community, those who do not run for office or are hesitant to express themselves and those who just simply want to be accepted members of the student body, are just as affected by incidents like this. They witness this rhetoric and are made to feel fearful of their peers. Which is exactly the objective: People like this want us to be scared. They want to silence us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, it’s increasingly easy to pick a side hyper-fast and stick to it. To reference a saying I heard recently, conversation has become either meaningless or impossible. We embolden ourselves within the comfort of our self-constructed echo chambers, “cancelling” anyone or anything that would make us question our ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my peers in A.S.: Why do you think the student body is fed up with us? When Senate meetings run for hours, Daily Nexus articles are flooded with anonymous comments full of slurs and baseless accusations and social media feeds are cluttered with ruthless campaigning and (not-so) subtle jabs at competitors, their faith in our ability to serve them dwindles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve turned into a reality show. At best, we’re the laughing stock of this campus; at worst, a waste of student fees. And when it comes to supporting our friends when it’s their turn to take the stage, we tear each other down. When elections come around, some of the most vocal people in our organization, who promise to uplift marginalized communities and uphold progressive values, are the ones who engage in this harmful behavior, stripping people of their complexities in their attempt to make them fit into their binary definitions of “good” or “bad.” Instead of fairly criticizing platform points and ideals, this has become a competition of whose identity is the most valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we expend so much energy fighting each other, we distract and become distracted from the fights that really matter — our graduate students are calling on us to support them, our balconies are collapsing while our landlords stay silent and the lawsuits against our UCPD are still stalled. Where is our solidarity?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are these the hands we want to leave the fate of our campus in? Will these be the people to create tangible change at UCSB, or will A.S. revert to its divisive, unproductive ways? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB student body: You each pay over $600 to Associated Students.

The United States Supreme Court </span><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a1016_o759.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">struck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> much of this ruling down in a 5-4 decision — once again along partisan lines — the evening before the election, citing, among other things, a desire to avoid “judicially created confusion.” Ironic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, this decision jeopardized the safety of those thousands who, having </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/wisconsin-election-absentee-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yet to receive an absentee ballot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, were forced to risk exposure to the novel coronavirus by voting in person, or abstain from voting entirely.

That said, this is abominable in ways which transcend the partisan battle line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this election is seen as legitimate in the face of likely numerous incoming lawsuits, it will have disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters. Even if those who did not receive their absentee ballots in time and were unable to vote in person are granted some mechanism by which to cast a vote  — which is at this point an impossibility given the SCOTUS ruling — there are still tens of thousands more who were forced to expose themselves during a pandemic to exercise what is supposed to be their constitutional right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that the coronavirus will continue to spread, with this election exacerbating what is already a rapidly escalating pandemic. There is little doubt that people will die because of decisions made by the Wisconsin legislature, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and, outrageously, even the United States Supreme Court.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypocrisy — and partisanship — is a stain on Wisconsin lawmakers and the Supreme Court.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poll workers, many of them elderly, chose not to work, which was reasonable considering the health risk doing so would have posed.

I place no blame on the poll workers who found themselves in such a harrowing situation and took care to minimize the risk of coming into contact with the disease. However, given the circumstances and the virulence of COVID-19, there was no sufficient way to protect the public against this virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Republican Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Robin Vos, </span><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/wisconsin-elections-robin-vos-draws-criticism-ppe-voting-remarks/2967319001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">draped himself in personal protective equipment while working the polls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite claiming that it was “perfectly safe to go out” and vote in person. Obviously, no such PPE was available for voters — it’d be a logistical nightmare — but Vos’ unwillingness to even signal solidarity or acknowledge the risks inherent in voting during this time is an act of unconscionable hypocrisy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That the U.S. Supreme Court was able to block a deadline extension for absentee ballots received late in the wake of significant challenges caused by coronavirus, while they themselves delivered their ruling </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/10/supreme-court-voted-remotely-deny-wisconsin-voters/5127252002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remotely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is hypocrisy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypocrisy — and partisanship — is a stain on Wisconsin lawmakers and the Supreme Court.

Uncertainty breeds a mix of feelings, whether that’s anxiety over how to stay healthy, sadness caused by social distancing or happiness from spending more time with loved ones. The ambiguity inherent in uncertainty can trigger almost any emotion —  and all of these emotions you are feeling are natural. That being said, as young, healthy college students, we are in a unique position of both privilege and vulnerability.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On privilege, I’ll be the first to say it: Check your privilege. No, this isn’t just directed towards the senior srat members sulking over the loss of spring break 2020. It’s about all of us. It’s about the fact that we are all being impacted by this new reality in different ways. For some of us, the largest inconvenience we will face is taking our classes online and not getting to see our friends in person, but many members of our community are facing challenges beyond that of a student. Many will lose their lives and many more will lose their loved ones, their livelihoods, their jobs and their health. We have all lost a part of our freedom, but our privileges are unique to each of us, and it is for that reason that community is so vital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The virus is here. There is one identified case in Isla Vista so far and we cannot afford to be selfish and think only of ourselves. Don’t wait for this to become “real’’ or relevant to you. Don’t wait until you know someone who has it or know someone who has lost a family member. The virus is affecting our community now and our community’s health depends on how effectively all of us practice social distancing. We have the capacity to stay home without completely halting our lives. We have the privilege of taking our courses online and we have the power to support each other. Think of your neighbors, think of the people you love, the people you don’t, the human lives at risk and when you think of your own very real struggles, think of them among the struggles of those which make up our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while having this awareness, it is also important to evaluate how these sudden changes have affected you. The world is moving forward and we are moving forward with it, but many of us haven’t stopped to feel that move for everything that it is and will be. As college students, we have an almost inevitable dependence on our campus, not just as our place for academic development but our place for meaningful interpersonal interaction. Our lives as college students provide us with routine and stability; our campus fosters curiosity and evokes creativity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are vulnerable to the sudden loss of all of the smallest details that made up our days: the light, ocean mist in the morning, the bustle of the bike lane, the familiar energy of the Arbor. And in many ways, we are vulnerable to silence at a time when we need to think and process and feel. So, to come full circle, do your rambling. You may not have clear feelings about the loss of riding around the bike circles or late nights in the library, but you know you have some feelings about it. Rambling your way through those thoughts with your friends will be a good reminder that you’re not alone. We are here and we are struggling together.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*socially distanced* xoxo,</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AJ</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to alleviate stress during times of uncertainty is to stay informed!

I was planning on going home to see my parents but at this rate, I don’t think I can risk going home and getting my parents sick. What should I do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any issue you have with housemates, it’s important to address it as soon as possible, as calmly as possible and as reasonably as possible. With this issue in particular, there is a lot at stake. I would suggest having a conversation with all of your housemates to establish some rules and practices during the coronavirus. None of us have lived through a pandemic before so it’s not expected that everyone will react to this situation in the same way. However, that isn’t an excuse to be careless or insensitive to one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line: Your home is a shared space. Given how easily the virus spreads, your house is only as safe as the most careless person in it. Even if four out of five of your housemates are cautious, one housemate being inconsiderate about hygiene or who they interact with will put you all at risk. This isn’t to say that your house needs to be on lockdown, but there are ways all of you can actively work to protect each other while making sure people feel comfortable in their own spaces. For instance, you could all make sure you wash your hands as soon as you come home or develop a cleaning schedule. You may also want to discuss what will happen if one of you gets sick. Will there be a designated bathroom for that person? How will you ensure you are all properly informed on best practices to keep each other healthy? Where will this person go if they need medical assistance? That is up for your house to decide, but having these conversations early will help reduce potentially stressful and risky situations. Having awareness is extremely important — be aware of your own needs and be prepared to advocate for yourself, but also be aware of how your actions may impact others around you.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The coronavirus is basically the flu, why is everyone freaking out so much? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not the fucking flu. Although there are some symptoms that resemble those of the flu, COVID-19 should not be handled as if it is the average flu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Bill Gates gave us a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AEMKudv5p0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As he put it, “an epidemic that would be more infectious and spread faster than Ebola did… is the greatest risk of a huge tragedy.” This would be the kind of tragedy Gates said we were unprepared for. He identified two main types of flus: ones that spread effectively between humans and ones that are extremely deadly. Those two factors have only occurred together once in history, during the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, known as the Spanish flu, which took the lives of nearly 65 million people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mortality rates of both the Spanish flu and COVID-19 are roughly 2.5% for the time being, but the coronavirus’s potential to spread is what makes it even more deadly. Many people who are already infected display no symptoms for days. These are the people who are unknowingly spreading the disease and causing avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hospitals’ capacities are limited by the number of available beds. Roughly 20% of coronavirus cases require hospital treatment and the virus’s ability to spread exponentially can lead to a surge in cases. This surge is what results in avoidable deaths due to our healthcare system being overwhelmed. That’s the key. If we are able to limit the total number of cases, there will be less of a need for hospital beds and less avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yes, the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people, but its ability to spread is nothing like that of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why is it racist to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus? It did start in China just like a lot of other really deadly diseases, and the Chinese government even tried to cover it up initially.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s racist because to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus would be attaching certain — most likely negative — ideas about the virus to an entire group of people. The actions and decisions of the Chinese government are not the actions of Chinese people as a whole. The actions by some Chinese people in one city or one region are not the actions of individuals of Chinese descent that live in America. Even if there was evidence that 100% linked the Coronavirus to a wet market in Wuhan, to attach the disease to an ethnic group is most definitely prejudicial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not the first time infectious disease has led to prejudice and it is certainly not the last. This pattern has only done damage to the sanctity of cultural diversity and the unity of this country. Ignorance should not be the choice we make as it will only spread hate and fear, if not reinforce the hold of xenophobia within the US.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">~ History lesson for you ~</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1959-1961, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">largest famine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in history took place in China, killing an estimated more than 30 million people. In the following decades, much of China’s population remained in poverty and consequently was starving. The communist regime which controlled all food production was unable to provide enough for its people to survive. It was at this point in 1978 that the government allowed for private farming. This practice of private farming lifted millions of suffering people out of poverty. A </span><a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16603900.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">household-based contract responsibility system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was put in place in which land was leased to families with the conditions of meeting fixed output quotas. Families were given land to meet their own needs and it was on these smaller private farms that families caught wild animals such as turtles to feed themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this wildlife farming was successful, it gained governmental support, which drastically changed the course of wildlife farming. These farms – whatever needed to be done to mitigate poverty – were encouraged. With the support of the government and the further development of policies to protect this type of farming, smaller farms turned into an industry and along with this industry came the illegal trading of endangered animals like tigers and pangolins. Some of these endangered species were later </span><a href=\"https://eia-international.org/wildlife/saving-tigers/tiger-farming/chinas-wildlife-protection-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sanctioned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the government for sale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What started as a solution to the imminent hunger plaguing families across China turned into an industry for the wealthy few of the country. China is the </span><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/wild-laws-china-and-its-role-illicit-wildlife-trade\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">top consumer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of illegally traded species but these species are being consumed by the richest people in China — a minority of the population that holds extreme lobbying capabilities (what’s new). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you go stereotyping an entire group of people, think about what you might be missing.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>HELP!!!! CABIN FEVER!!!!!!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was my original inclination to tell you to try something new to fill your time, and I do encourage that, but you can only try so many new things before “trying something new” loses its excitement and sparkle. In that vein, I would say a few things: stay active, have regular virtual social contact and do more of what you love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to underestimate how much we actually move around when we go from class to class or to various meetings. Now that seemingly everything has been moved to the virtual world, it’s important not just to get up and move around, but to actually go outside. We live way too close to the beach and the mountains for anyone to stay inside anyways. Even if you’re not a particularly active person, taking a walk to the beach or even just around the block can be therapeutic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot stress enough how important social isolation is, but even though you shouldn’t physically be with anyone outside of the people you absolutely must see, you should still actively try to talk with your friends. Check up on them and also use this as a time to talk about how all of these changes have affected you. It is too easy to close yourself off to the world but short, regular check-ins with your loved ones will help you maintain your sanity while socially isolating. Plan wine nights or game nights with groups of friends once a week over FaceTime or Google Hangouts or Snapchat (try the filters — you won’t regret it). Having regular, scheduled meetings with your friends will give you something to look forward to. I also have gotten in the habit of sending my friends photos of puppies and Jude Law. Likewise, I always love it when I get articles from my dad or funny memes from my friends; these small points of contact throughout the day make all the difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, do more of what you love. Invest in doing the things you love and connect with people who share your interests. If you enjoy exercising, join a virtual yoga group or plan weekly runs around the lagoon with your housemates.

I cannot agree more. The infrastructure of UCSB’s online learning experience compared to that of the local community colleges, or even local high schools, has been inferior. This rush to implement inadequate software coupled with poor instructor communication under a strict quarter system threatens to tarnish the reputation of UCSB. However, more importantly, your student population is severely underserved by these glitchy and problematic systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace already had the options for forums and video uploads.

Students that are now practicing social distancing are also feeling isolated from their academic community. The general feeling of faculty disarray is communicated through chaotic Zoom lectures and the numerous conflicting emails subsequently raising student anxiety levels. It is clear that the faculty were not supported enough prior to the start of spring quarter to prepare and alter their lesson plans.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB experience is one that <a href=\"https://www.ucsb.edu/about\">aspires to deliver</a> a “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamic environment that prizes academic inquiry and interpersonal connection to inspire scholarly ambition, creativity, and discoveries with wide-ranging impact</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” When students are met with broken links, overloaded systems and deliverables that are disjointed and confusing, you should expect us to ask why and demand better of you.

Unfortunately for the U.S., Donald Trump has mismanaged this crisis from the outset.

He has referred to the coronavirus as </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“fake news,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his trademark dismissal for all events that don’t align with his agenda. Trump has also </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Democrats’ criticism of his response to coronavirus is a“hoax” that was created to hurt Trump’s 2020 political campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s utter dismissal of the threat of coronavirus demonstrates his thorough lack of preparation and education on the subject. Even when he was later asked if he regretted his word choice, Trump said no. He claimed that he was proving he was capable of handling the Democratic “hoax” because his administration is doing </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“such a good job” </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of handling the virus. This is simply not true, as the Trump administration has consistently fumbled its attempts to contain the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late February 2020, the U.S. government had to decide if 14 individuals from the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who had tested positive for coronavirus should be flown home from Japan with a group of over 300 healthy individuals. The CDC strongly advised against this explaining that the infected individuals could easily spread the disease to healthy passengers. The US government decided to ignore this warning. Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-was-not-told-coronavirus-infected-americans-would-be-flown-home-from-cruise-ship/2020/02/21/ae58b24c-54be-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the fact that he was not aware of the government’s decision to do so, which is hard to believe. Even if that were true, that he would be so unaware of such an important decision is a blaring display of his incompetence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s portrayal of coronavirus as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-200323102618665.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“China Virus”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is racist. Trump is so worried about getting blamed for mismanaging the virus that he has resorted to pointing fingers elsewhere, carelessly fueling racial tensions in the process. We as a nation have unfortunately gotten used to Trump’s nonsensical rants, but this is especially unacceptable when time is of the essence and the country is in a state of full-fledged panic. We need a leader, not someone who is out to serve his own interests. Instead of guiding the U.S. through these trying times, Trump is putting Asian Americans at risk for hate crimes because he is so intent on deflecting blame. At the end of the day, this is an egotistical and self-serving approach because it does little to address the real problem and will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can truly see the extent of Trump’s failings by looking at how other leaders are handling the situation. For example, South Korea has also experienced a significant number of outbreaks, but their </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/17/south-koreas-coronavirus-success-story-underscores-how-us-initially-failed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was prompt and aggressive, unlike that of the US. The South Korean government made testing readily available in order to determine the number of cases and isolate those who were infected for treatment. The South Korean government was also more transparent with the information they presented to the public, with the effect of decreasing feelings of panic. As a result of these measures, South Korea has managed to </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow the rate of infection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Testing in the U.S., on the other hand, has been more of a reactionary measure than the preventative one it should be and is </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still not widely available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by any means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, Trump’s ineffectiveness in dealing with the coronavirus is having — and will continue to have — dire consequences. The worst-case scenario for the US is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-projections-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.2 million deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an overwhelming amount of people lacking medical care due to a shortage of  hospital beds and doctors being forced to make heartbreaking decisions in terms of who to provide treatment to. The need for all these restrictions, including school closures and lockdowns, is to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“flatten the curve”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible. Our healthcare system does not have infinite resources and we need to be careful not to overload it. It’s also necessary that we try to make supplies last longer, even if that results in a longer battle against the virus. We need only buy as many resources as necessary while making sure that our neighbors also have equal access to them. Now is not the time to let panic take control and for us to hoard essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is easy to get distracted by the problematic nature of Trump’s leadership, we as citizens must do our part to prevent the virus from spreading. These restrictions are a hassle. Being asked to abruptly move out of Isla Vista and transition into online classes are huge disappointments, especially for graduating seniors. Unfortunately, this is a developing situation and one we must adapt to by practicing effective social distancing and good hygiene. Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election. It will provide an opportunity for the American people to condemn Trump for the despicable way he is handling this crisis while using their vote to select a better leader for the future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop is dismayed by Trump’s ineffectual and racist handling of coronavirus and urges individuals to do their best to help contain it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

We won’t be going to Davidson Library, Campbell Hall or the Rec Cen anymore. We might not even be walking at our commencement ceremony in front of all our friends and family. All of those promises we held out for until our last year, the bucket list items that we promised our freshman-year selves to complete by the end of senior year, will now go unfulfilled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting here in self-quarantine, I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and reminisce. At first, I was angry: angry at myself, my housemates, the university, the government, you name it. Then I just felt sad. I thought about all the goodbyes I didn’t get to say, all the faces I might not ever see again, all the places I may never get to bike to. But after riding out this rollercoaster of emotions, I think back on my years at UCSB and I am so, so, so happy. There is no other university where I would have wanted to spend my three years and seven months at, no other people that I would have wanted to share my college memories with, and there is simply nowhere like Isla Vista, no other place I would’ve wanted to live in. My college experience showed me how to love myself and others, that work and play can coexist and that strangers can become friends overnight. If it weren’t for UCSB and the people that I met along the way, I wouldn’t be the person who I am today. For that, I am forever grateful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2021 and the classes to come, take this as an opportunity to reflect on your college experience. Fulfill the promises that you made to yourself sooner than later. Don’t hesitate to introduce yourself to that stranger in your class you always make eye contact with. Don’t opt for nights in bed instead of nights spent with your friends. Don’t leave your bucket list untouched until the last quarter and, most definitely, do not convince yourself that winter quarter has to be boring. Don’t leave it all until the end because you never know if that opportunity will be taken from you. Life is precious, yet unrelenting, so cherish it always.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2020, I am saddened by the way that our time at UCSB has come to an end, but I am even more saddened by the global pandemic that has taken away people’s lives and livelihoods. This pandemic will go on to affect more than just our college careers; it will affect people for years to come. As a collective group, it is important for us to understand that we have the power to help alleviate this crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us are fortunate that we have UCSB, family and friends as our support systems because many people going through this do not. We are fortunate that we had three years and seven months to build a strong support system that we can lean on during this difficult and hectic time. Let’s use this opportunity to stay aware, educated and informed and to act with compassion, patience and love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending love from my quarantined room to yours,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Fukui<br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class of 2020</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/","id":5715,"author":{"id":812,"name":"Christine Fukui"},"related":[5714,5713,5712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"C.A.P.S.

Friends warn friends that C.A.P.S. is understaffed and underfunded. They inform each other that they may not be able to see a therapist for weeks and that some might not get an appointment at all. With the most “at-risk” cases — individuals with either severe mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts — prioritized, it can be difficult to secure a spot for others needing help. These issues cause students like Ace (whose name has been changed for their privacy), to ask if their problems are worth taking a space away from someone else “who might need it more.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rumors about underfunding </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appear to be close to the truth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Regarding wait times, Osimo shares that the period between a student’s Brief Assessment (BA) and appointment varies, with 46% waiting less than 7 days, 27% waiting between 8-14 days and 11% waiting between 18-21 days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C.A.P.S. BA system, wherein a student must drop in to be “assessed” by a C.A.P.S. intake personnel, has been in place for two years. It was developed with the hope that these quick check-ins would increase the number of people C.A.P.S. can help. After this mini-therapy meeting, students with sufficient need are assigned therapy appointments, while others are recommended student groups to attend. Osimo remarks that for the BA, 90% [of students] are seen in less than one hour, 32% of students … in less than 15 minutes. And 12% of students … [are seen in] 45-60 minutes.” But since the BA has to be conducted in person, it has proven to be another area where students find difficulty accessing C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessments are usually conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. Ace remarks that students who are juggling classes and jobs are “screwed” when it comes to matching their schedules to that of C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. closes at 4:30, “and so [during] the times you might be able to go and do one of those intake appointments, [such as] around dinner— [C.A.P.S. is] not there,” Ace said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Osimo acknowledges, “it doesn’t feel good to have to wait when we are dealing with an issue.” So, to try and combat student schedules, C.A.P.S. offers 20 peer group sessions where students come together and share their experiences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> LiveHealth, a new teletherapy service which accepts Student Health insurance, now collaborates with C.A.P.S. to connect students and therapists online (and unlike C.A.P.S and Acacia, does not have long wait times).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “We also know that not everyone needs the same thing,” Osimo continued. “Many students just need one appointment to discuss a specific goal rather than meeting multiple times for therapy.  We offer different options for different needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By acting within their budget, C.A.P.S. has attempted to help the largest amount of students possible — but as history shows they need more funding. C.A.P.S.’ lack of funding </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been an issue since 2006,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the Regents were presented with evidence of rising mental health issues in college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, from 2007-09 counseling programs across the UCs were granted a $12 million budget increase, achieved by raising student fees for two years (this was 28% of the initially requested $43 million dollars). They achieved decreasing the wait period for students to see a professional, but a rise in “the severity of student issues and greater demand for mental health services” continues to be a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in 2011, the University of California’s Office of the President applied for and received a $6.9 million student mental health grant funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA). Each campus was given $500,000, and the UC continued to receive CalMHSA until </span><a href=\"https://saccityexpress.com/gov-brown-vetoes-mental-health-bill-rejects-services-targeting-college-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former Governor Jerry Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vetoed it in 2016 and 2017 because the UC didn’t state an exact amount of money or a source for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2015, the UCs have been increasing student services fees by 5% to address the lack of therapists. Because of this decision, 80% of approved new positions “have been filed across the UC system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, issues like the UC’s inability to offer competitive salaries, recruit diverse talent and maintain consistent state funds have made it difficult to fill the remaining openings. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-2020 budget detail</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “additional funds are still needed [to hire more staff].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to work at places that are financially stable. So, to help our students, we need to provide more benefits for our staff.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their experience, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. does a good job of allocating its limited resources. By prioritizing people with serious mental health needs, Ace believes that even if a person is angry that they have been recommended to join a peer group rather than a one-on-one session, it’s important for students to understand that C.AP.S. is trying its best: “You got to trust in the expertise of the person sitting across from you … there’s a reason why they’re suggesting what they’re suggesting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace recalls that they used to convince themselves that they were fine because there were people out there in worse shape than them. “I sit here like, ‘Should I go to C.A.P.S.? No, I shouldn’t go to C.A.P.S. because I’m fine and I’ve never attempted suicide, I’ve only self-harmed a couple of times in my life.’ I’m really not ‘that big of a risk,’” they said, adding air quotes. “But in reality, people have told me several times now, it’s not really about being a big risk — it’s about preventing a big risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ace advises that even though it’s scary, students need to be honest to ensure that they receive proper treatment:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you go into C.A.P.S. and they’re like, ‘Have you experienced any suicidal thoughts?’ do I really want to answer this question, and then I have that moment of ‘should I lie? Should I just be like, “no, everything is fine, it’s all fine?”’ And the most important thing to do is to say [to yourself] ‘No, I’m answering this honestly’ … because at that point, if you start being honest with yourself, the person sitting across the table from you has an ‘oh, fuck’ moment and they then can understand your needs better.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time. Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one of the limitations of C.A.P.S., Ace found, is that their therapy only occurs once every other week and “that model does not work for a lot of people … which is why they try to push people into Acacia and into Santa Barbara [Behavioral Health] clinic … to get them into therapy sessions that are a bit more regular.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than being a place for long term one-on-one therapy, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. works best for those dealing with a mental health crisis. It allocates its resources to helping the most people possible, and the easiest way for them to do that is to act as a place of transition before recommending more long-term options for therapy. However, C.A.P.S.’ lack of traditional therapy is an issue at the heart of student dissatisfaction with the organization. With midterms, the quarter system and the increased likelihood of developing a mental illness in their early twenties, all students deserve the option to speak with a C.A.P.S. therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s solution to this problem is simple:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need more money. With the limited resources I don’t know what else they can do … keep putting more and more on them [and] you’re just going to crush them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s ideal for how C.A.P.S. should function involves more therapists, evening hours and the availability of weekly sessions for every student. “[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time,” Ace says. “Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ace and I are currently in C.A.P.S. therapy, I have many friends who have “given up” trying to get in. C.A.P.S. is on-campus, takes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student insurance and is a resource promised to us by the university. Demand for mental health care has risen, and while C.A.P.S. is doing its best to help everyone, they need more. Our campus needs more. But the question is: where can we find the funding?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are having any dangerous or suicidal thoughts, please call UCSB After Hours Counseling Services at (805) 893-4411. Or please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1 (800) 273-825. Everyone deserves love and guidance. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Morley wants all students struggling with mental illness or life in general to have a safe place to go, and admires C.A.P.S. for all that they do.   </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/","id":6471,"author":{"id":801,"name":"Hannah Morley"},"related":[6470,6469,6468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Remembering JJ Sanani","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-03-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Friends of Intare \"JJ\" Sanani remember the late fourth-year and recall many pieces of wisdom he passed along during his life.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth of JJ’s life was obvious. The smile on his face meant what you thought it did, and the concern behind his voice was always genuine. JJ’s life at UCSB was filled with adventure because he knew the value of a life, before his closest friends had to realize it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We lost JJ Sanani on the night of Dec. 13, 2019 — at the end of finals week in fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He smoked Lucky Strikes (no filter) and drank Natty Daddy. He would rock a fit with sandals, too-short running shorts, a colorful shirt, a thick tan overcoat and some shades. When you told him something </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shocking</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he always furrowed his brows and made a concerned face. He grew his hair out all year, and they were long enough where we called them </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worms</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He was taller than everyone, and so he was able to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put his arm around you and he always pulled you closer. He would drop his head down to your level and say, “Listen…” before saying his words after you finished your story. He was a people person. He had love for everyone — himself, his closest friends and the friends that pissed him off most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there was an article written about JJ that did not mention the partying, the author did not know him. In a large crowd, JJ would always be caught with the biggest smile and unmatched excitement. Combining his hair, clothes and height, he was always the first one to be spotted in a crowd and he embraced all of that love. Believe me when I say that JJ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> danced. And since he was so tall, so were his limbs, making him a bit lanky. Nevertheless, the man was able to move his hips (and we all knew it). I, and many others, are thankful that he provided an avenue to enjoy so many rowdy nights out. There is a video I have on my phone where JJ is on the roof wobblin’ so hard you couldn’t miss him. He stayed in his prime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ would never answer his phone when people </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needed to find him. Yes, it was difficult to get a hold of him, but once he locked his eyes on you — he didn’t let you go. JJ has pushed through crowds of people to put his arm around his special people and ask, genuinely, how they are. In those moments, his love showed so much that it melted everything else around him. Only you existed for a few minutes. He was down for the people, the thrill, the memories, all in an effort to battle the fleeting time of college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about living in the moment — the man constantly lost his phone. And his wallet. There were times where we talked about it and he told me that he kinda liked not having his phone because he would avoid distractions. The only way he could tell the time was by listening to the bells of Storke Tower. He was proud of living in the now, without any extra worries. Not only did he survive, but he thrived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For sure, you notice his clothes and his hair, but his smile was beyond words, and you only ever saw it at its fullest. JJ’s truth lived on through his laugh. It’s easy to say that everything could be a joke to JJ, and his infamous chuckle is something that I hope my ears never unhear. He was also able to make you feel like he was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> listening to you. He asked all of the right questions, in the middle of it all. He knew how to console all of his friends, and he was appreciated for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did he listen loudly, but he made sure </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knew he loved us. He made sure to tell me on many occasions how much he loved and trusted me. It helps me to know that so many in Isla Vista got the same kind of treatment. He took the time to have those one-on-one conversations whenever it was needed. I am taking the time, now, to recognize that. I have a vivid memory of standing on his balcony during summer session where he told me something like, “You don’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it Gilbert, I seriously </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seriously</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trust you — and you’re one of the only people I can say I’ve trusted with my life since day one. I don’t think you’ll </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get it dude, you are a special guy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The only person I was glad to have laugh at my problems. In the end, he was always able to bring it back to how tiny we are compared to the universe, and why that means we should just make the most of our life in motion. JJ was a reminder to not let it pass by you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was also known for being very vocal about his values and was not easily persuaded. From topics on religion, politics, education, social life and ethics, we’ve had all of those debates in my old bedroom. The point is that though JJ never really came out on top of those debates; he was humble enough to ask more about it and to concede when it was appropriate. To be able to admit fault and to adapt is rare. During freshman year, he would always get in arguments with our friend Daniel, and I had to come up with a safe word: “dolphins.” Look, a safe word for bickering sounds ridiculous, but it worked. Every. Single. Time. He stayed humble. All of this to say that JJ still fought to the end, with his teeth and his knees. His passion is what we all remember. Those values that he held closest to him, he never let go. He knew what it meant to respect and appreciate those he cared about and stood up against unfairness. It was hard to make him sit down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, JJ was known for being kind and loving. It was a unique love because it was so widespread. I don’t need to mention all of the times I’ve been stopped while we were walking together because everyone wants to say hello. His genuine words with individuals, his spirit filled with fire and his humble admiration for his friends around him is what he leaves for the rest of us. The irony is that my first memories with JJ are about discussing all the adventures that UCSB had to offer us, but JJ did not know that he would end up </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the community itself. JJ’s impact on Isla Vista was larger than he could even imagine, and he would be damn happy to know that he touched so many people.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93502\" style=\"width: 193px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93502\" data-attachment-id=\"93502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-sanani-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=720%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"JJ Sanani 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93502\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2-141x250.jpg?resize=183%2C324\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Section II:</i> A Mosaic – Accounts by those closest</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandon Hanan </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with JJ, he always took a genuine interest in my life and my problems. He always had this profound wisdom he would share with me to uplift my spirits and he knew the right times I needed to hear it. I remember a time back in high school when I was going through a bit of a slump in my life and JJ and I were together hanging out in the backyard of my old house when he expressed to me, “Brandon, you do know that you’re my brother and one of the most unique and charismatic individuals that I have ever met in my life, right? I mean, that’s why so many people love you.”  That statement hit me so hard I remember it to this day and it changed my whole perspective of who I am as a person. He just knew what to say and when to say it. No one else could give me those types of inspirational pep talks like JJ did because no one really knew me like he did. His uniqueness, selflessness, wisdom and authenticity amazed me throughout our friendship. He also had a catchphrase he would always say to me that described his life so perfectly, which was “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c’est la vie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meaning, “that’s life.” JJ always lived life to the fullest, fearless of risks and valued human connection with every single person he came in contact with. I would be a bit nervous about JJ organizing my bachelor party, but I used to always tell him that he was going to be the best man at my wedding. I knew regardless that he is my best man and will always be in my heart. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not about having anxiety for the future or regret from the past. It’s about living fully, like JJ did, in the present moment in our lives.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kasimir Tan</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon first impression, JJ was notable for his good looks, his sense for cynical — yet truthful —humor, his nice smile and his unquestionably good sense of style. But one way that he really stood out in our community of Isla Vista was in his listening skills.  In our modern day of technology and distractions, you will rarely come across a person who had the listening skills that JJ had. I always really enjoyed talking to him because a conversation with him was always rich. He was generally interested in what the people around him thought regarding deep subjects, such as the state of the world, science, religion and theology.  Whether he knew you for days or years, he could engage with almost anyone at any time and make them feel that he was truly thinking about their words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really appreciated this quality of his when I was his roommate. Over the nine months that I lived with him, we got into some quarrels as roommates often do.  Though at some points we wanted to bite each other’s heads off, we almost always could come to some conclusion and better understanding of one another that would help us resolve our issues.  I think we both realized that oftentimes the anger we expressed at one another had sources that were external to our relationship, and that through discussing our issues, we understood each other better and the anger dissolved.  One profound way in which he expressed his understanding was when I would call him out on his bullshit. After explaining to him why I thought his behavior was immoral or why it was bothering me, sometimes he would say, “You’re right, I’ll do better next time.”  I’ve never met anyone who could admit fault like he could and who had the humility to tell someone else they were right when he realized they saw he was wrong. As I got to know him more and more, I really felt that he was one of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truest</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends I had in my time at UCSB.  Though it didn’t always seem like it through his flaws,  I came to realize that he genuinely cared for all the people that were a part of his life, and he showed that he cared through how he spoke and listened to people.  I really liked that he had this quality, which is so rare these days. When I think of him, I miss the pleasant and unpleasant conversations we used to have. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Put down your phone to listen to what the people physically around you say, and try to understand where they are coming from. This is a positive quality that will help you make others feel special in our modern world.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilbert Nazari </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met JJ on the first day that we moved into Anacapa Hall, and it has been an adventure and friendship I could never expect. Coming to terms with such a loss, I can at least grab onto those moments where he told me, “I trust you more than anyone else out here.” He was able to share those moments of truth when I didn’t know I needed them. I will never forget how intensely JJ would introduce me to the people that were around him. Since I missed a year of college, I was always behind with meeting so many mutual friends, but JJ never stopped introducing me with fire in his words. He would tell people “I love this guy more than anyone!” or “You don’t know how lucky you are to meet Gilbert.” The passion in those introductions is something I’ll never forget. He’d wrap his long arms around my neck just to share me with his friends — making connections. Even his own backyard party where there were too many heads to count, when he saw my face in the crowd, he went after me. And he stayed so passionate about speaking beauty of his friends that I can’t forget it myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you love someone enough, you let them know. And when you introduce them to the friends you love, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduce them like your life depends on it.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isa Guilfoyle</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, I’d run into JJ and, no matter how much time had passed, or what he had going on, he made me feel important and cared for. I think the thing he would tell me the most was just to relax, that I worried too much about everything. JJ taught me so much about how to enjoy life even when everything seems to be going wrong, because JJ knew that life was a gift and he wasn’t going to waste it. Even though we grew apart as life got in the way and sometimes weeks would go by without us seeing each other, every time we did, it went the same way. He’d show his big, toothy smile and shake his head, looking up to the sky with that carefree laugh, then he’d scoop me up in his arms and hug me tight enough so I could smell the stog he was probably smoking a few minutes before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time during our sophomore year, we ran into each other like this and JJ seemed especially excited. He started telling me about a class that he knew I would absolutely love because the majority of the work was done playing at recess with elementary schoolers. JJ and I would dream about being pediatricians together our freshman year of college. He reminded me of this and had me convinced. I remember the first time I went to a recess with him. To this day, I have never seen kids </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excited to play with someone. Within a few seconds, the kindergarteners had climbed up and all over him. He had kids hanging from his arms, holding onto his legs, climbing onto his front and back and a few ran circles around him. He just looked at me and smiled so big. JJ was completely content; he loved these kids just as much as they loved him. The sight of a JJ jungle gym was so funny, and such a pure representation of who JJ was. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Take care of those that you love and always let them know. JJ would carry you until his back broke and smile about it. He would make you laugh until you cried, or stop crying because you were laughing too hard. He’d call you out when you needed it but knew how to distract you. He was a true friend beyond space and time, and he will be forever missed. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Harano</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ and I had many great memories which I will cherish for the rest of my life. I will always miss that amazing sense of humor, his inquisitive mind, his wonderful outlook on the world and the people he shared it with. Through the way he lived, he taught us all so much about how important it is to have a positive attitude and how that positivity can encourage those around you. The most important thing I learned from JJ, however, did not come from one of those great moments I was able to share with him. Instead, it came after one of the worst arguments I’ve had with a close friend. JJ was always incredibly sensitive to the feelings of others and was deeply in tune with his own feelings. That being said, one time he and I had a horrible argument where we hurt each other’s feelings and said some terribly damaging things to one another. However, in an act that was truly reflective of his character, JJ came into my room the next morning and told me that he was still deeply upset with what was said between us but more importantly, he said that he genuinely cherished our friendship and that our relationship meant more to him than anything that happened the night before while letting me know he still loved me deeply. JJ always sought to make things alright with everyone and was willing to put his friends above himself in all cases. He displayed an emotional maturity and deep level of caring for those around him that is simply invaluable and somewhat rare for people our age. No matter the instance, he sought to be the best person he could be and made a genuine effort to bring light and happiness to those around them. He never shied away from being the bigger person in order to preserve what he cared about more than anything else — his friendships and relationships with those he loved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> JJ taught us to love deeply and to do everything you do with your entire heart, to be genuine with those around you and most importantly, to never let anything get in the way of spending time with those you love. It is because of this beautiful legacy that JJ will reign forever in our minds and our hearts. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nick Lombardi</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been 89 days and from time to time, I still forget that you are gone. When I watch the sunset and remember the raw conversations we had, I think of you. When I see someone trying so hard to become a better version of themself than they were the day before, I think of you</span><b>. When I see someone who is hurting but tries to run from their pain by loving others harder, I think of you</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The expression we had for you was “tell me you love me.” This quote was so perfectly representative of who you were: an expression that showed your vulnerability, but also your strength. You weren’t afraid of talking about topics like love with me. You showed me the importance of not being afraid to share your true emotions with both those you love and those you had just met. By doing this, you were able to create a bond that was individually special, raw and unique to each person you talked to. You had a way of pushing my buttons just hard enough to see how deep I could go. You weren’t afraid of seeing my pain, but instead, you would often seek it out just so you could show me that I wasn’t alone through it. You pushed me through stuff I didn’t want to deal with because you truly cared about me. Finally, JJ, you taught me how to love unconditionally, through all of the darkness. You are forever in my heart.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you I loved you enough when I could have. When I see you up there, you won’t have to ever say our quote again. Until then, with my whole heart, I love you buddy. Rest easy, brother.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don’t be afraid to smile in the face of your own vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Josh Lewczyk</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was the first person that I met at UCSB and living with him in the dorms our first year was an experience I’ll never forget. Going into college, I knew that JJ and our other roommate, Jack, had been good friends since high school. I was definitely worried that I would be the odd man out, but JJ put that fear to rest on the first day that I met him. Talking to JJ was always so easy, even if the subject matter got serious, and he quickly became my closest friend at UCSB. I started freshman year as an introvert, but JJ helped me get out of my comfort zone and I met most of my close friends through him. I remember my favorite moments with him were late at night when we would sit by the lagoon and just talk about all the crazy stuff happening to us. There was this spot that we would chill at almost every night that looked right over the water. We were there after my first breakup and after my first failed college class, and he was always so quick to remind me of all the good stuff happening in our lives. He was just such an easygoing person that it was hard to stay upset around him. JJ was a true friend and he helped me get through some of the toughest moments of my life. I honestly don’t know what I would have done without him.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we are going through right now is only temporary and in no way defines us.  We are in one of the most beautiful places in the world right now, with some beautiful people — let’s make the most of it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daniel Gitlin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and most important thing you need to understand about my relationship with JJ is that we never agreed. Not on a single issue. But, for some reason, that strengthened our relationship more than any commonality could ever have. We were diametrically opposed and yet, two sides of the same coin; fundamentally, I think, we were somehow the same person, striving for the same goals, haunted by the same fears, but manifested in two wildly different personalities. That’s why JJ was my best friend, because no one understood me, or people, better than him. No one could wrap you around his finger, or build you up from dark places, like JJ. No matter how angry we might have been at each other, no matter how frustrated and high-strung from balancing our S.T.E.M. education with daily degeneracy, JJ and I always bonded through debates about art, religion, philosophy, our lives, marriage and the meaning of happiness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of my memories about JJ from our sophomore year revolve around our room. We had the deepest — and often most heated — talks of our relationship in that room, amongst mountains of his unending laundry and a littering of my various foodstuffs. Seated on a cigarette-stained futon with our feet propped on a posh leather footrest stolen from God-knows-where, our hopelessly broken windows streaming in afternoon light and the ocean breeze, we poured our hearts out. I specifically remember one of those afternoons: The conversation was more or less a rerun of talks we’d had before, until one of us decided to play music on our “shared” bar speaker. It evolved into an arrangement of our favorite songs, a wispy reflection of our lives as LA-born, beach-town college kids. A dash of Frank Ocean, some of JJ’s favorite Bob Marley, RHCP and then, for the climax, the bittersweet beauty of “Hotel California” by the Eagles. As we mouthed the lyrics and air-strummed Joe Walsh’s power chords, it became a song that so perfectly captured the crescendo of our lives.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entranced by an ephemeral dream, drawn in by a beautiful woman, and ensnared in a seemingly ceaseless cycle of partying, remorse, abstinence and partying.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We imagined this world we’d built as a tautology, a prison. But the kind of prison that life would be meaningless without. Every time I think of JJ, I think of him as the patron saint of the Hotel California, something like flame incarnate: so bright and frenetic and hopelessly confined, yet, somehow, so unabashedly free.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love life, and all of life’s people, in the most essential form.

We shared stories, we shared laughs and we shared tears just remembering the love you brought to each of us individually. Thank you for that opportunity. Thank you for your beautiful gift of bringing entire communities together through your love. You helped teach me what community truly is. You helped teach us that we are not alone in our struggles. You helped teach us what being there for one another really means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really difficult planning the memorial for JJ. It did not require a massive amount of work but given the situation, it was the only thing on my mind for those three weeks leading up to it. There was so much support from the community, all just wanting to contribute and honor the man we miss so much. I set up a Facebook event page and helped decide exactly what we wanted to do for him. I had no clue what a memorial should look like or what we were even going to do at first, but as I kept thinking about it, I realized the message behind it was the community unity and support for each other.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93503\" style=\"width: 393px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93503\" data-attachment-id=\"93503\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93503\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2-250x167.jpg?resize=383%2C256\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because he passed away right as school was out, most people heard about the news when they were alone or with family. I was so thankful to have been with my father at the time, but what I needed and was missing was to be with my housemates and those who knew him. That month was agonizing, knowing that so many of us had to get through this loss without the support of one another right there. By the time of the memorial, I feel like it was difficult for a lot of people to reopen the wound. Within literal minutes of when we asked people to show up at our house, the entire house was shoulder-to-shoulder packed with JJ’s loved ones. From the house, we walked down the street with each person carrying a lit candle. It was something I will never forget. 400 strong, we were able to show the support we had for one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memorial was for JJ, but in a way, it was more a way to show that we, as a community, had each other to lean back on. To cry and to just love one another. To show each other that this was not something anyone should get through by themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we arrived at the bluffs overlooking Devereux Point, I told the group that this was a time to just be unified together. A friend of JJ’s named Peyton and I set up blankets prior to the group arriving. Whether people wanted to share funny stories or the way he impacted their lives, they were free to do so. However, I told them that if they just wanted to sit there in silence and just grieve with one another, that was so okay also. Some people spoke, but some of it was silence and an overwhelming feeling of love. We cried and just held onto one another.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93504\" style=\"width: 354px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93504\" data-attachment-id=\"93504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93504\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-250x167.jpg?resize=344%2C230\" alt=\"\" width=\"344\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93504\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the front, I got a slab of plywood that I painted white.

It would have been easier to not think about and not face, but that is not what this community did. I am so proud to say that this is the community JJ surrounded himself with. A community that was there for him in the hardest of times. To all that were there, I am so thankful that you loved him well. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/","id":5714,"author":{"id":805,"name":"The Opinions Staff"},"related":[5713,5712,5711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Girls Have Hair, Why Should I Care?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Flesh Prison","publish_date":"2020-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Body-Hair-Article-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Body-Hair-Article-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"\"Let's just let the hairy girls live,\" exclaims Anabel Costa as she urges readers to do as they damn please with their body hair.

My arms were hairy, my legs were hairy, my eyebrows looked like caterpillars — the whole works. I’m proud to say that by the time I got to high school, I was already kind of over it. Who the fuck cares if I have hair on my arms? Of course, every so often a blunt child I was babysitting would still point it out, but it just didn’t bother me the way it used to. I assumed that anyone else who had suffered these insecurities was probably over it by now, too. It wasn’t until I learned that one of my best friends shaved her arms about as frequently as she shaved her legs that I realized this was still a problem for women my age.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we care so much about regulating female body hair? It all starts with razor companies. </span><a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillette patented the safety razor in 1904</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it grew in popularity, being clean shaven became a symbol of basic hygiene. This made at least a little sense at the time: Because many people were living in close quarters and had limited access to bathing, shaving was seen as a way to prevent lice and bacteria. This idea was </span><a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/shaving-ads-1920s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily marketed to men</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; to be clean shaven was to be a hygienic and civilized man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1920s, things began to change. With a new decade came new fashion trends, and we all know what the 20s are famous for: flapper dresses. This meant that women’s hairy armpits and legs were on full display. </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/137072-100-years-of-shaving-ads-show-how-weve-been-tricked-into-going-hairless-photos\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Razor companies saw this as an opportunity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell more razors and began telling women they needed to be smooth. The epidemic spiraled from there, and now generations of women are worried about everything from the hair between their eyebrows to the knuckles of their toes and everything in between. A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s pretty fucking ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, so I decided to talk to other women about their relationships to their body hair and how they may or may not have come to embrace it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first woman I talked to was Nisha Jagota, a fourth-year student here at UCSB. One memory that Jagota shared was from fifth grade, when she and her friends discussed what they should and shouldn’t shave before a pool party. “We all got together as a group, like, ‘okay, what’s acceptable, what should we do?’ Nobody had it figured out. Nobody has a good idea of what’s ’right’ so everything’s really convoluted,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From as young an age as 10 or 11, girls already know that they will be judged. They know that there is a “right” and a “wrong,” but the standard is so arbitrary that they’re left guessing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagota told me that she hasn’t worried too much about her body hair since coming to UCSB. One of the biggest moments for her in the journey of her changing relationship with her body hair was participating in the Vagina Monologues and spending time with other women who wore their hair however they wanted to. “It was really great being surrounded by all different types of women, and nonbinary folk as well,” she said. “And visually seeing women who had unshaved armpits wearing tank tops and bras … I’m not gonna say they were making a statement, because maybe they’re not, maybe it’s just for them, but for me, it really was them making a statement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madi Braum, another student here at UCSB, had a similar experience after leaving high school. “I started shaving my legs consistently when I was in sixth grade, before I even really needed to,” she said. “But for years after that, I refused to go outside the house in shorts if my legs weren’t shaved.” After graduating from high school, however, Braum said something “clicked,” and she hasn’t shaved since. It’s been three years since she put a razor blade to her shins.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dana Laufer is a third-year student at UCSB, and her first memory of being shamed for her body hair is from fifth grade. “I raised my hand in class to answer a question, and a girl said, ‘Oh my god, Dana has armpit hair.’” When she went home that day, she told her mom what happened, and she taught Dana how to use Nair to remove the hair from her armpits, resulting in painful burns that kept her from attending school the following day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Dana got to high school, shaving felt more like an option than a necessity. “My brother used to say it was gross when girls don’t shave their legs,” she said, “but in high school, my friend and I used to have competitions to see who could go the longest without shaving their legs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no interest in telling anyone how they should maintain the hair on their body. I personally like it when my legs are smooth. However, had I not been socialized to believe that hairy legs are gross, it might be a different story. More than anything, I want every person to be able to make choices that work for them without being subjected to any outside pressure. Let’s just let hairy girls live. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants women to do whatever they damn want with their body hair.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Are they any good? The a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nswer is a resounding no. Although Porter makes the </span><a href=\"https://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claim</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he will “ban fracking in the county,” this point is moot. The rock formations in Santa Barbara County require cyclic steam injection to extract oil, which unlike fracking, necessitates the injection of superheated steam rather than chemicals to extract oil. Therefore</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, banning fracking in this County would have little impact on oil production. Additionally, Porter </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/01/22/voter-suppression-charges-roil-supervisorial-race/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that local oil production will cut carbon emissions, but 80% of known fossil fuel reserves </span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WG_p247Kq3lOKHgDJOw117D7Luol5g3n/view\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must be kept in the ground</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to avoid worsening the climate crisis.

Bob Nelson, a candidate for the Fourth District seat on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and former chief of staff for the current Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam, </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has also received funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from oil interests. This district includes Orcutt, Lompoc, a southern segment of Santa Maria and part of the Los Alamos Valley. Currently running unopposed, Nelson has also been </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Porter’s benefactors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In turn, Porter for 2020 has </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributed money and lawn signs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Nelson’s campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though he has received comparatively less contributions than Porter, Nelson has also received funding from multiple smaller, local oil figureheads. Most of </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come from real estate or housing development LLCs but many of these have ties to the oil industry. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Los-Angeles/burton-mesa-holdings-llc/67194667.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burton Mesa Holdings, LLC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has contributed $5000 to Nelson’s campaign, is led by Kenneth Hunter, who is also the president of </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0703841D:US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaquero Energy Inc.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a local oil and gas company. Kenai Drilling, another donor to Nelson’s 2020 campaign, is a local drilling company based locally in Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The company is owned by Tim Crist, who donated to Nelson’s campaign in his own name. Kenai is one of the</span><a href=\"http://www.kenaidrilling.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> largest drilling contractors in the state of California</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rigs available to conduct oil, gas and geothermal drilling on land as well as offshore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 3 we have a choice: to vote for a candidate whose policies are inextricable from the interests of the oil companies or vote for a Board of Supervisors that will stand up to Big Oil. Regardless of political orientation or party membership, a candidate’s funding says a lot about their values and so these facts matter. Afterall, climate change is a bipartisan issue and will affect us all. Here in </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are already experiencing the effects of the climate crisis. This is why it is critical that we take action to elect local representatives who take the climate crisis seriously. Electing officials who are not influenced by oil money is one big step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheina Crystal, Kayla Gorman and Miranda O’Brien encourage students to look into where candidates are receiving their funding.

Most news and media outlets aren’t reporting politics in a cut-and-dry way. Instead, they use something called </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=186&amp;v=UpqFaf8vQfk&amp;feature=emb_title\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tactical framing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An example of this is the coverage of the Green New Deal. Essentially, it is the practice of framing news stories around how the Green New Deal divides the Democratic party or how Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump feel about it. What the news doesn’t say is what the Green New Deal actually is, or why we need it. </span><a href=\"https://networks.h-net.org/node/11470/reviews/11612/bateman-cappella-and-jamieson-spiral-cynicism-press-and-public-good\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has written an entire book on how this type of news framing makes the public cynical. When the news focuses on strategy over substance, people are less informed on the facts. I didn’t even know what the Green New Deal was for a while. What I did know was that the GOP hated it and that it would never pass. Tactical framing often produces a negative effect by pitting people against each other and encouraging partisanship.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of action. When we feel like what we do doesn’t matter, we don’t bother taking action. I know so many people who don’t care to vote because “one vote won’t make a difference.” One vote does make a difference, because one individual vote becomes 10 votes, and 10 votes becomes 100, which becomes 1,000, which becomes 10,000 and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of progress. If everyone decides not to act because their vote doesn’t matter, or that abstaining from eating a hamburger won’t make a difference, then we can never move forward as a society. Take the climate crisis as an example. This might be the biggest issue facing our generation. The climate crisis means I might not be able to have children with the knowledge that they won’t live through an extinction. What types of things do we have to do to mitigate this crisis? Drive less, fly less, shop less, eat less meat and have fewer kids, among other things. But who cares if I drive downtown instead of taking the bus when everyone else is driving too?  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things can get better, but we need to act now.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s true </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to make a real difference, everyone has to take these steps individually, and there’s no time to be cynical.

Super Tuesday is on March 3 this year, and the participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. It is the single most important voting day in the presidential primary. On Super Tuesday, the greatest number of delegates will be voting, meaning that more delegates can be won on March 3 than on any other day in the primary. And for the first time in a while, California is part of it. Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia — all of these are swing states that will play a huge role in determining our election.

My dorm room looked out onto the lagoon and I was just a five-minute walk away from the ocean. It was so beautiful that I felt unnerved and alone. It was so white that I thought of campus as being the Wonderbread World.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came from the Jefferson Park/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles that at the time was still largely a community of African Americans who, like me, originated from Texas or New Orleans. It was a vibrant place to grow up. There were many skilled craftsmen in the neighborhood; my neighbor Charles owned a Jaguar repair shop and did very well with his business. My dad was the neighborhood mechanic and worked nights at the post office, so he was around in the daytime to take me and my neighborhood friends to the beach or Griffith Park. Mr. Bambino would barbecue peach brandy-soaked ribs and the neighborhood kids would line up for a couple to gnaw on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a kid, I would listen to my brothers’ friends sitting on the corner drinking beer, smoking weed and talking about the brutality and unfairness of the Vietnam War and the racism in H.P. Lovecraft back in 1973. It was a rich and complicated black world where I developed confidence in my intelligence and talent.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I needed all that confidence because UCSB was an overwhelming transition. In my neighborhood I knew no white people outside of my teachers, and most of them were white.  I lucked out with Mr. Martin, my African American second grade teacher who realized I wasn’t “retarded” like that nun at Holy Name of Jesus Christ, I Wept said to my mother. He expected the best out of his classroom of difficult black kids, and, later in high school, Mr. Klewitz (a former Marine) taught us photography. Then there was Mr. De Louise who taught the first creative writing course I took. And Mr. Feldman, who started an aviation club at my high school and took black and Asian kids flying in small planes with flying buddies. There was Mr. Soloff, who took us to Cal State LA to see his chemical experiments as he pursued his master’s degree in chemistry. The commonality between all these teachers is that they treated us like they gave a damn and included us in their lives. They weren’t indifferent to who we were </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they seemed to actually care about us.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, in my first chemistry lecture class, the professor said: “Look to your left and look to your right. By the end of the course both of those chairs will be empty.” I assumed he was talking to me, so I never went back to class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t acculturating because I lived close enough to Los Angeles that I went home often </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so often that I won the ironic award for being the most social guy on our dorm floor by being the least present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I stopped going to LA.  My high school girlfriend had been admitted to UCSB, and I discovered that she was now very popular. She was skinny and tall and, though that wasn’t desirable where I grew up, at UCSB she was popular.  She kicked me to the curb, and I was lost for a bit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonely was bad enough, but then I failed a course for plagiarism — I copied copiously from the Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I hadn’t taken notes in my philosophy course because I was too busy listening to what the professor was saying in the lectures. I had to drop chemistry, and suddenly I was on academic probation. I saw myself being tossed out on my ass and losing my financial aid and everything I had worked on. I feared leaving UCSB and breaking my parents’ hearts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started pulling it together and looked for classes to help me maintain a full load, and I found a poetry workshop with Robin Bell at the College of Creative Studies (CCS). It was fun and exhilarating and, because CCS didn’t give letter grades, I could catch my breath about my biology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I decided to ask Martha, a Latina I met in our composition course, out for coffee. Martha danced in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ballet folklórico</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on campus, and she’d invite me to the practices. Among her friends, it didn’t seem to matter that I thought of myself as a black guy. I was a Mexican to them, though I didn’t speak Spanish and neither did Martha. I liked hanging out with her friends.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                            </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martha left UCSB.  She felt it wasn’t a good fit for her, like many of the students of color I had become friends with. UCSB became even more devoid of color as I recovered from a broken heart. Luckily, I had made friends with some of the guys on my dorm floor and soon I was living on Del Playa with Pat, a cowboy hippie, and some other guys. No one had explained to me that there was a yearly I.V. riot. I shot photos for the Daily Nexus of guys in swimming trunks and women in bikinis tossing bottles at the police from the relative safety of my fenced-in yard. No way was I going to wander I.V. and be arrested for being the black dude with a stolen camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to learn the ropes at the CCS. I took a narrative prose course from Marvin Mudrick, who had a great sense of humor and would occasionally rip folks apart in his class. He said my science fiction story, which I had published and won money for, made him want to throw up. I turned to writing about my black neighborhood in LA and he liked it, though he didn’t know I had written it: Mudrick taught his writing workshops by having writers toss their work on the table in front of him and he’d read the stories cold, out loud. It was a revelation. I wasn’t being judged </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the story was being judged. I felt free to write about my life because I was anonymous. After 40 years of teaching workshops, I still believe his method of running a workshop is the best.  Also, Provost Mudrick valued diversity, and CCS was diverse. My friends and fellow students at CCS were black, brown, white and Asian. I never felt excluded. I felt supported as a student of literature and as a writer. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I won awards for my writing as an undergraduate and after receiving my master of fine arts in literature at UC Irvine. I sold my first novel, “Understand This,” to William Morrow, went on to publish six novels and some spent time on the LA Times bestsellers list.  One of the novels takes place at UCSB and is about life on campus and in Santa Barbara for African and Latino students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my success as a writer to CCS and UCSB. From being a Disney screenwriting fellow to a Shanghai writers fellow, from starting LitFest Pasadena (the second-largest literary festival in California and the most diverse) to watching my daughter Giselle graduate from UCSB four years ago, just like her mother did, and then receiving a White House internship and internships with Senator Diane Feinstein and Congresswoman Judy Chu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve taught at USC, UCLA, LMU and UCI, but I think of UCSB as home. My observation and suggestion for UCSB is to embrace diversity by doing what USC has done with their highly lauded and internationally known Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI). The program fosters diversity by supporting public schools in the most economically challenged communities, particularly for incarcerated youth. CCS has hosted NAI students at UCSB a number of times. As a former high school teacher who taught in inner-city schools and wrote about them, I know that aligning with a major academic institution with resources can bring tremendous positive change, but the commitment has to be long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USC’s NAI program has been going on for 29 years, and Foshay, a NAI school, is now the number-one feeder high school for USC in the country. NAI students have a higher graduation rate than the general student body at USC. When I was a kid, I attended Foshay Junior High, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I constantly worried about my personal safety. Now, it’s famous for creating the kinds of students who flourish at the university level. UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the hiring process at the UCs needs to address the dearth of professors of color.

Hebrew school was a place where I met other people like me: kids whose families celebrated Shabbat on Fridays, whose ancestors also came to America fleeing the horrors of World War II, who wanted to party it up at their own bar or bat mitzvahs in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience was unique in that I was brought up in a reformed sect of Judaism, one that explored how traditional ideas could be reexamined in a modern context. At Hebrew school, whether making crafts celebrating the Jewish holidays or in song sessions with the cantor, we were always encouraged to ask questions. As we got older, this extended to encouragement to question the texts we were learning about. There was a surprising amount of recognition that parables written thousands of years ago could reasonably be considered outdated today. The emphasis was always on taking from Judaism what you wanted. Nothing was strictly imposed on us except for good morals and the occasional splash of Zionism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s right: Pro-Israel rhetoric ran forcefully through the underlying messages of my generally progressive temple on a regular basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In seventh grade, we learned about the Jewish holy sites in Israel but not about the complicated histories of bloody political conflicts that gave us access to them. In eighth grade, we learned about the Israeli Defense Forces, but nothing about who they were fighting against. And in my high school confirmation class, we sat through PowerPoint presentations highlighting the incredible success of Israel’s recent technological advances without any reference to their equally fast-growing weapons technology.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never once was there any mention of Palestine. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is visiting this country with an organization like Birthright Israel endorsing a political view that I do not hold? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the United States was actually </span><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/us-israel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the first nations to recognize Israel’s sovereignty </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 1948 and has remained a steadfast ally since then. While this alliance may have devolved from a moral stance into something more akin to a strategic asset, positive relations between the U.S. and Israel have remained surprisingly constant throughout the turbulent histories of both countries. The United States has also historically played a significant role as a mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, a role that has increasingly favored Israel as a result of the budding love affair between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two make quite the couple. Where previous Democratic American presidents have pushed Netanyahu to consider a two-state solution, the Israeli Prime Minister has </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/825371795972825089?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he can now trade ideas on voter suppression and the building of walls with our current President. Both fond of </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/the-trump-netanyahu-alliance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bullying members of the press and unwilling to engage</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in negotiation with Palestine, it comes as no surprise that both leaders appeal to the racists and absolutists of the right wings of their respective countries. Both have been served multiple </span><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/01/28/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-on-charges-of-bribery-fraud-and-breach-of-trust-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indictment charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Netanyahu for breach of trust — in their respective nations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To consummate their blossoming relationship, it seems that Trump believes that he and Jared Kushner can single handedly succeed where almost a century of diplomatic relations surrounding Israel and Palesine could not. While confidently boasting to have finally found a viable path to a Palestinian state, this claim only distracts from further disregard for Palestinian rights. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/28/21111890/trump-israel-palestine-peace-plan-deal-century-apartheid\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s so-called “peace plan”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concedes to labeling Palestine a state as it continues to cement its dependence on Israel. Trump’s proposal divides up Palestinian territories and surrounds them with Israeli ones, essentially giving Israel total security and economic control over Palestinian lands and rendering any Palestinian government powerless. Since its proposal, the plan has largely been </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-most-immediate-unexpected-threat-of-trumps-middle-east-peace-plan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">viewed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a call for Israel to annex the West Bank territory, but no action has been taken yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to escalate, I find that despite any hypothetical connection to Israel that my Jewish identity might encompass, I remain utterly repulsed by its government’s repeated aggressions as an occupying power, as well as the actions of “my own country” in support of this abuse of power. I have been openly and loudly critical of President Trump, and now I’m starting to recognize that his actions are being mirrored by Prime Minister Netanyahu. While many liberal American Jews don’t think twice about criticizing the various horrific actions of our President, they are reluctant to extend the same criticism to Israel’s Prime Minister because of the link between Judaism and Israel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This link is largely perpetuated by the idea that Israel exists as a Jewish birthright. Birthright, under the guise of being an apolitical educational experience, largely promotes Israeli military propaganda and ignores any Palestinian narratives about the reality of life under Israeli military rule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jewish claim to Israel is at best a questionable one.

This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recently added staple of the Birthright experience is what the organization calls a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/where-birthright-went-wrong/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mega Event,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can only be described as a glorified propaganda show. Modeled after music festivals, the event is headlined by popular Israeli bands and is put on specifically for the participants of Birthright. However, the event is funded primarily by pro-Israel billionaires, including Las Vegas tycoon Sheldon Adelson. That’s right, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/12/14/sheldon-adelson-trump-macau/#2554f58021c7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Trump’s largest donors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout his 2016 election is also funding Birthright.

By supporting Birthright, these are the people and political messages you are endorsing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What once was universally viewed as a Jewish rite of passage has now become a source of protest. Participants in Birthright are now beginning to </span><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-young-jews-walk-off-birthright-trip-to-join-anti-occupation-activity-1.6271943\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk off the trip</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in protest of the lack of attention it pays to the realities of Israeli occupation. This is the beginning of a more modern resistance that refuses to let Jewish identity be manipulated for the Israeli government’s political motives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birthright does not build Jewish community. It encourages blind faith to an oppressive state and right-wing regime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I refuse to be the same kind of “progressive” that the temple of my childhood unwittingly perpetuated </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the convenient kind of progressive. The kind that allows you to pick and choose which human rights abuses deserve scorn. The kind that gives blind allegiance to the Israeli government. The aspects of my Jewish upbringing that I love and treasure have taught me to be critical and ask all the questions that I can about things that others claim to be fact.
