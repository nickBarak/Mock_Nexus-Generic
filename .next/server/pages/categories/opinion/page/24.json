It started in 2009, in response to crippling budget cuts, with the idea of an 11th, completely online campus. However, more recent efforts have focused on building partnerships with private online education companies like Coursera, edX and Udacity, which have gained recognition recently for innovations in online learning platforms. The aim has been the same: to make online classes a central part of a UC degree to the tune of 20 percent of total credits by some projections.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I take issue with both the process behind the initiative and the prospect of such an education. But first and foremost, I am appalled by the absurdity of the fact that the same people who constructed the fiscal crisis in the UC system — the governor and the regents — are now determining how we will deal with it. The same group of administrators that has condemned us to institutional poverty is now telling us that we must fundamentally restructure and digitize our curriculum just to stay afloat.</p>\n<p>Their online strategy is fundamentally flawed because it does not address the root of the UC’s budgetary woes, that is, the ongoing financial neglect of higher education in California. Gov. Jerry Brown and the UC Regents are instead trying to paper over this political dilemma with a technological fix. They are counting on rallying our collective fetish for “innovation” and our enthusiasm for new educational technologies as a way of obfuscating the political-budgetary choice they have made to continually subordinate higher education funding to debt servicing and prison production. They want to bury their continued disregard for the UC system in flashy Silicon Valley-branded technologies, which they offer as our only hope of survival.</p>\n<p>Much like the budget cuts of the last five years, the online push is an entirely undemocratic endeavor, a top-down initiative envisaged from the heights of Sacramento and the UC Office of the President and foisted upon a broad base of students and faculty.</p>\n<p>It reminds us again of the peculiar constellation of political power in the UC system. Of the 26 voting members of the UC Board of Regents, only one is a student Outside of two nonvoting members who directly represent faculty, the rest are administrators appointed — not elected — to 12-year terms by the governor.</p>\n<p>This arrangement in which decisions about the UC system are made not by the students and faculty who make up its heart, but by distant, unelected managers, is wholly undemocratic. It is through this machinery that we are being told to move our learning online.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the terms in which online education is being discussed are misguided. Since Gov. Brown and the regents have posited online learning primarily as a way of saving money, the focus of the debate has been trapped in market terms: how it can reduce costs and increase efficiency. There has been relatively little discussion of how online education will (or already does) enhance or degrade the quality of instruction and education.</p>\n<p>The problem is that learning — truly transformative learning that helps you to grow as a person and as a citizen, not just information transfer — simply does not obey the rules of the market. It cannot always be done cheaper and more efficiently with new technology and automation.</p>\n<p>And when the question of the quality of online courses does come up, the administrators who claim to speak for students like to float the idea that our generation of “digital natives” simply learns better on computers than we do in classrooms, that we prefer learning through interactive YouTube videos than we do through intimate face-to-face discussions. I think that is bullshit. They construct that narrative because it is convenient for their agenda.</p>\n<p>I, personally, am tired of the ever-enclosing boundaries that debt-servicing budget cuts artificially construct around our educational experience. Our so-called leaders have locked us in an austerity prison-house and now claim to offer us the only way out.</p>\n<p>More online coursework may have some place at the UC (if the decision makers were grounded, they would see that it already has a place), but it is not a solution for budgetary neglect and it cannot be commanded from above. A successful public university system, one that prepares us to be creative and engaged citizens, requires significant public investment. There is simply no way around it.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick Sheehan is a fourth-year sociology major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, May 3, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This means saying what you like, how you like it, when you like it, where you like it and not being afraid to be the initiator and get specific with your boy.</p>\n<p>Sexy-sneak-attack him next time he walks in the door: put on some of his favorite lingerie, tackle him onto your bed (counter, table, couch, floor — the list goes on), proceed to take off said lingerie and then do all those things that you said you’d save for his birthday. He’ll be living the dream, and I bet you he’ll do his best to make sure you feel the same.</p>\n<p>Then, when it’s his turn, tell him if all he’s doing is bouncing around like a kid in a Jolly Jump. I promise you that it’s better to say in the moment, “That’s not doing anything for me; put your back into it.” If you wait for him to look up one time and see you staring blank-faced at the clock, counting minutes while he’s busy thinking he’s blowing your mind (sore subject), you’re only losing out on your own pleasure and destroying his manhood.</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to say is you need to be completely naked in each sense of the word every time you show up to play with your man, or it will definitely be embarrassing for one of you, probably him. A combination of insecurity and shame does not make a night one to remember, for the right reasons at least.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Bring Beer.</p>\n<p>Although beer is the golden blood of happiness and does actually make the world go round, I don’t mean that you can make him happy just by bringing him beer (certainly helps, though). On this one I mean you need to think about what you bring to the table when push comes to shove. If you’re not doing the pushing or the shoving, you need to seriously reevaluate your sexual tactics.</p>\n<p>Basically, take into consideration that guys need to feel like they’re being taken care of — not babied, but taken care of.</p>\n<p>Part 3: Batman.</p>\n<p>Remember his fantasies. Chances are that your man is not Christian Grey and does not dream of tying you to a telephone post while using some medieval torture device to get off. However, if Mr. Grey is actually your man, then please disregard this section.</p>\n<p>Every single boy has dreams of different freaky ways he wishes he could get it on and most of them are harmless and exciting. The problem is that far too often, these fantasies are disregarded because the act itself is “good enough.” I’m here to tell you that if you let him wear his Batman mask and talk in the Dark Knight’s voice as he explores your Batcave with his Batmobile, you will have given that man a memory to be cherished until the end of time.</p>\n<p>All I want to say on this one is, take his fantasies into consideration next time you are trying to enjoy yourselves, and I’m sure he’ll remember it the next time he has the opportunity to return the favor.</p>\n<p>Men are not impossible to figure out; take care of them and they’ll take care of you.</p>\n<p><em>E.

I have a 2-year-old son who is in the White Door of the Orfalea Family Children’s Center. Recently, I heard that the university is going to cancel the daycare fee for students. Please don’t!</p>\n<p>My husband is a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. I am not a TA or RA and don’t have any income. Thus, my family monthly income is only around $2,700 after taxes. We need to pay apartment rent ($856 monthly), my tuition ($4,319.56 quarterly) and my son’s daycare fee ($385 monthly). In fact, my husband’s salary is not enough to support our daily living. If my son’s daycare fee increases, we will not be able to afford it. Therefore, we need to consider sending my son back to China to live with his grandparents. The truth is, we really want to keep my son with us in the U.S. to watch every step of his growth. I think this is a simple wish common to all parents.</p>\n<p>Please pass my situation and urge the school to support families like us. I would really appreciate it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

With the resolution’s defeat, I propose we consider some of the arguments used to attack the resolution and understand how the nature of the Israel/Palestine debate has been poorly framed.</p>\n<p>One position central to the resolution’s opponents holds as a central contention is that conscientious opposition to Israel’s actions necessarily isolates and stigmatizes Jewish students, perhaps implicating them in Israel’s human rights abuses. This position reinforces, albeit indirectly, the tired and troubled conflation of anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism. It bears reiterating that the Jewish faith as such is completely separable from Zionism, which is known to us today as the dominant ideology of the state of Israel and is used to legitimate an apartheid status quo where the allotment of greater rights to Jewish citizens, as opposed to non-Jewish citizens, is the law of the land. Proponents of divestment are critical of Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights. To conflate their position with anti-Semitism is lazy and unethical.</p>\n<p>Expanding upon the argument that Jewish students would feel stigmatized under the resolution, it is helpful to remember the Islamophobia that characterizes American society today.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To draw on a topical example, consider the Boston Marathon bombings. The New York Times published an article Friday morning that was meant to break the news of the firefight that preceded the elder Tsarnaev’s death and the subsequent manhunt for the younger Tsarnaev, but, before telling of the event itself (the who, what, when, where and why that constitute the mainstay of objective reporting), the editors chose to sketch the political and religious history of Chechnya. The intent of this, if not the effect, is to associate the Tsarnaevs with “fundamentalist Islam” independent of any hard evidence, other than national origin.</p>\n<p>To make the connection, it appears as if anyone who commits an act of violence in the United States and also happens to be a Muslim is assumed to be a fundamentalist, an extremist, a terrorist, etc. The objection of the Jewish students is, as I understand it, similar insofar as it is based in the fear that Jewish students will be associated with the human rights abuses of Israel by virtue of their identity as Jews, and thus ostracized, much the same way America is largely associating the Tsarnaev brothers with “fundamentalist Islam” by virtue of their identity as Muslims.</p>\n<p>Moving to another argument, the suggestion that Israel is unfairly singled out for its human rights abuses, while other states are not, fails to take into account the cozy relationship between the U.S. and Israel today (with over $3 billion in “aid” given to Israel by the U.S. annually) and Israel’s unique position as perhaps the settler colonial society/agent of Western hegemony (and here being familiar with the political and economic nature of early 20th century Zionism and Zionism as it has evolved after World War II in light of the Cold War and Arab Nationalism is key).</p>\n<p>The level of support that Israel receives, and has received historically from the western powers, is embodied, at least in part, in today’s world by the use of technology developed by American companies, and this is indicative of the extent to which the playing field is not presently level and the university in particular assumes a distinctly nonneutral posture. In the 1940s, Israel received military support from the West, support that contributed to Israel’s dominance in the initial war and ethnic cleansing that resulted in the creation of Israel as a state. Today, Israel receives all the latest American military technology, which is used, as we were reminded in November, to destroy Palestinian property and kill Palestinian civilians. The current imbalance in the situation is clear. Thus, when opponents of the resolution suggest that the truly “neutral” thing to do would be to reject divestment so as to appear to favor both sides equally, they neglect the extent to which our community already stands behind Israel.</p>\n<p>The implicit message of the argument that Israel does not deserve to be singled out and that the university must maintain a supposed position of neutrality is that Israel’s actions are justified (or at least that opposition to Israel’s actions is unjustified) given the injustice that takes place elsewhere in the world, and the failure to recognize Israel’s crimes in this way is disheartening. While it is pleasing to witness and contribute to what I take to be the rejuvenation of UCSB’s political realm, the decision of the Senate to reject the resolution represents a gross misreading of the nature of the dollar as a form of speech in American political life (a point that cannot be illustrated fully, for want of space) as well as the true nature of the situation in Palestine today, and the nature of the U.S. position and the University of California’s position, vis-à-vis Israel.</p>\n<p><em>Michael Dean is a fourth-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This article appeared online only on at dailynexus.com on Friday, April 25, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51065\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/left-said-tackles-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51065\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/left-said-tackles-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/left-said-tackles-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/left-said-tackles-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/left-said-tackles-divestment/","id":5926,"author":{"id":219,"name":"Michael Dean"},"related":[5925,5924,5923],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Voices on Voting: Student Backs TBL, Independent Media","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"We as students face a continuing uphill battle to protect our rights to information even though we attend a public institution.

Whether it be information about increasing student fees, cuts to classes, cuts to administrative services, or the way in which the money we pay for our education is used by our institution. This is vital stuff that most of us do not have the time to investigate on our own, which is why the existence of independent media is such a necessity. One such example of independent media is <em>The Bottom Line</em>, which serves the UCSB community through its unbiased and informed investigative journalism. As an independent form of media on campus, it provides us students the information we want to know without being tied to advertisers or commercial interests.</p>\n<p><em>The Bottom Line</em> currently survives on an ever-slim budget, which has consistently dwindled as our public school system has had to make budget cuts. In the face of this it seeks to remain a truly independent paper, funded by those who need its information the most: UCSB students and it does not want to be held by outside interests. A similar independent media source on campus, KCSB-FM 91.9, remains independent through a student lock-in and community member donations.</p>\n<p><em>The Bottom Line</em> seeks $1.69 from each student a quarter, which is less than most of us pay for a small cup of coffee. Moreover, <em>The Bottom Line</em> deserves consistent funding so that it can continue to grow into something bigger and better, to reach its full potential. Not only does The Bottom Line provide students a rare chance to get involved directly with the media and to delve into very important student issues but it is the type of entity public universities need to have; a medium that is constantly analyzing and questioning and seeking out answers for its community.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Independent media must be fought for and sustained on our campus. <em>The Bottom Line</em> provides us students with the critical analysis we cannot do alone.

Queer Commission, End Fake Clinics, Take Back the Night, Voices for Planned Parenthood and The Women, Gender, and Sexual Equity Department, are extremely frustrated...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We, A.S. Womyn’s Commission, A.S. Queer Commission, End Fake Clinics, Take Back the Night, Voices for Planned Parenthood and The Women, Gender, and Sexual Equity Department, are extremely frustrated and disappointed with your decision on April 22, to not endorse the proposed fee increase for The Women, Gender, and Sexual Equity Department. In your reasoning you explained that a fee increase from $4.25 to $8.17 per student, per quarter, seemed “extraneous” and that the current fee “already provides adequate funding.” Furthermore you claimed that, “increasing student employment, expanding community outreach programs and maintaining up-to-date libraries and lounge areas do not seem like the best use for student funds,” and added, “especially in light of recent tuition increases and student budget constraints.” It is our view that student employment, community outreach, libraries and spaces to study and feel safe, are indeed crucially important especially in times when other services and opportunities are being reduced. Therefore, allow us to explain to you, in more depth than your journalists were capable of, the importance of the WGSE department, the organizations that cooperate with and rely on the WGSE department, and most importantly the necessity of these spaces in the UCSB and Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>First let’s begin by addressing what exactly the WGSE department offers to this campus. Aside from a library and conference room available for student organizations, that you made sure to highlight on both articles printed on April 17 and April 22, the WGSE department does much more with its far from “adequate” funding. They are responsible for CARE (Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education); Sexual Harassment Prevention Education Program; the Non-Traditional Student Resource Center; the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity; quarterly program offerings and support groups. In other words, a SAFE SPACE. Moreover, they work with many organizations on campus such as: PAVE, Men Against Rape, A.S. Womyn’s Commission, Take Back the Night, VOX- Voices for Planned Parenthood, Women’s Ensemble Theater Troupe, Women in Science and Engineering, Student Veterans Organization, Queer Student Union and A.S. Queer Commission. WGSE provides safe spaces and advocacy for survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking. They also provide LGBTQIA resources as well as resources for non-traditional students (student parents, veterans). Additionally, WGSE is adding a new advocacy fund. In the past, survivors would have to pay for protective orders and other fees on their own, and this new advocacy fund would allow WGSE to help pay for those costs. The WGSE department is essential to these groups and individuals for funding, support and advocacy.</p>\n<p>Your refusal to endorse a fee increase that is much needed and you labeled as “extraneous,” was particularly outrageous considering the community WGSE serves. Knowing the high prevalence of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, hate crimes, homophobia, gender discrimination, among other issues that occur on this campus and in Isla Vista, common sense dictates anyone to think critically about this center and what it offers to this campus. Your decision against this fee is emblematic of how disregarded these, unfortunately very common, issues are at UCSB. We invite you to step into the WGSE center, where increased funds are a necessity, to educate your paper and properly research everything that the center has to offer. We recognize your influence on this campus and urge you to use it responsibly; do not belittle safe spaces as a luxury, strive for more than “adequacy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>The above letter was written collaboratively by: A.S.

While standing in support of healthy dialogue as a learning process, we as the 2012-13 A.S. Executive Officers have decided to submit comment with respect to A.S. matters in pursuit of providing correct information to students.</p>\n<p>What follows includes responses to assertions made regarding the capacities of A.S. process and personnel, our shared concerns that we have been obligated to address together this year and, for the first time in A.S. history, a collective endorsement across party lines of the presidential candidate we believe most qualified to continue addressing such concerns, all of which we feel compelled to vocalize amongst a sea of rhetoric.</p>\n<p>In terms of student fees and all other money students put into the university, fees paid quarterly to Associated Students are not part of the academic tuition you pay each quarter. A.S. fees are directed to A.S. and include services across a wide spectrum, while tuition is directed to the University of California. Therefore, a reduction in “student fees” (fees that go to A.S.) does not constitute a reduction in tuition. In fact, a reduction in student fees limits the availability of services. The only time fees can be reclaimed is when an individual deems that a specific A.S.-sponsored activity has contradicted the individual’s ideological/political/religious beliefs, and the individual completes the paperwork necessary to reclaim the fees he or she contributed to that specific activity, per Smith v. Regents. The amount of return an individual may receive rarely exceeds six cents historically and is usually designated based on specific events. The notion of returning “unused” student fees to individual students at the close of the academic year is not a viable possibility. We want to make clear that referenda dollars voted on by the students is a rare moment when students actually have a say in where their fees are going, especially compared to the University’s past negligence in terms of making your tuition distribution transparent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The accusation of “corruption” within the Executive Board was related to the tuition assistance that A.S. executives receive, which this Executive Board, for the first time ever, advocated to cut such honoraria — making it the only board to do so and puts action behind words. Such accusation, we believe, is damaging and based on misinformation that does more harm than good to students. Tuition assistance for A.S. execs is meant to retain the A.S. values of accessibility and inclusivity by preserving the opportunity to serve in exec positions to be available to all students regardless of socioeconomic backgrounds. As the result of economic realities and the time-intensive nature (40+ hours per week) of executive positions, some students would not have the ability or time to balance a part-time job and hold an exec position were it not for tuition assistance. In addition, many students are not able to serve as elected officers not because they are not qualified but because they do not have the economic privilege to do so, especially in light of increasingly burdensome tuition.</p>\n<p>To ensure accountability, A.S. already has checks and control points in place for addressing and adjudicating internal matters of corruption or frivolous spending. These mechanisms take the form of Judicial Council, Senate ratification and advice available from A.S. staff, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we would like to take corrective action with respect to an incident that occurred this year involving the misuse of Associated Students resources for personal and academic purpose. Toward the end of November, a student that was not elected or appointed impermissibly used the A.S. name in an effort to collect data for a class project. This effort constitutes false pretenses, fabrication of an A.S. committee and the subsequent deception of the entire undergraduate and graduate student population at UCSB. In response to this incident, and in an attempt to ensure this type of abuse never occurs again, the A.S. Executive Officers chose to endorse the only candidate for A.S. President that, in our collective opinion, demonstrates the integrity and trustworthiness that is vital to fulfilling the mission of Associated Students: Megan Foronda. However, this decision ultimately rests with the student body.</p>\n<p>Foronda has proved her thorough knowledge of the internal processes of A.S. and has extensive experience uniting, rather than dividing, students. She understands the power of student voices and listens to their concerns, breaking away from the exclusive nature that A.S. seems to take when individuals focus on themselves and pursue their own agenda. Megan has always supported a wide variety of students, whether that be through allocating resources toward a diverse array of events or being the only presidential candidate that has substantially planned and organized large-scale events and spaces in which students can critically discuss relevant issues at the university, especially those that critique Associated Students. She has also been involved in effectively teaching students about the California budget crisis in relation to the privatization of higher education which, in a climate of constant attack on affordability of tuition, is ever-important.</p>\n<p>As the elected representatives, we think it is necessary to bring a healthy dose of constructive criticism, desperately needed for a governing body often marred by party politics and rhetoric that clutters the Association with negativity, hostility and discomfort. We, as individuals from all parties and nonpartisan backgrounds, felt it necessary to convey facts to the student body amidst quite a bit of misinformation out there.</p>\n<p>Associated Students is more than elections, and elected representatives are only a portion of what A.S. has to offer. The President, as the Chief Executive Officer of Associated Students, is your official representative on campus, systemwide, local, state and federal matters, which only increases the need for a president with a solid plan and a demonstrated ability to effectively and responsibly use resources. In short, Megan Foronda is the only presidential candidate that resembles this type of leader and the goals, aspirations and integrity Associated Students needs.</p>\n<p>It is our sincerest hope that you continue to remain critical of your elected student officials and engage in healthy, open and honest dialogue regarding issues that pertain to you. Whomever you vote for, we hope you vote and question information being presented to you. We thank you for your thoughtful consideration in reading this message and wish you a truly enjoyable Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><em>The Executive Officers have all decided to endorse individually, and our titles are used for identification purposes only.</em></p>\n<h5></h5>\n<h5>A version of this letter appeared on page 16 of the April 25, 2013 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h5>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/","id":5957,"author":{"id":471,"name":"Multiple Authors"},"related":[5956,5955,5954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gents, Tame Your Man-Mane… And Let Your Inner Lion Find His Roar","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My doves, my pets, hello.

I dream a dream of perfectly mowed, or at the very least nicely trimmed, meadows in the pants of men everywhere. Yes, you young rapscallions, you, today we will be discussing the importance of manscaping. About damn time.</p>\n<p>If you are a man, you may wonder: when should I trim the ball-fro? A rule of thumb: If you’re going to show it, mow it. Your most sensual apex should be a metaphorical front lawn. Don’t be the scary man down the street whose home is lost in the undergrowth. The one that requires the local EMTs to hack down the grass with a machete to cart out your critically sex-starved body … OK, I’ll admit I got carried away with that metaphor. Just remember you want the yard to look nice.</p>\n<p>I recommend having your crotch trimmed. If you are a generally hairy guy, don’t shave it. Imagine going to the zoo and seeing a gorilla. Now imagine that gorilla has crudely shaved only its genitalia. Take that horror and ponder it for a moment. A trim will suffice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for the rest of it, I’d say, anywhere you want licked should be shaved. Balls and shaft should be devoid of hair. If you get random hairs growing on your dick, pluck that stick. I do not want a hair dislodging itself at the back of my throat. It will tickle and perturb. Just as you wouldn’t get hot watching your cat cough up a hairball, you won’t enjoy my deep human suffering at the hands of your misgrooming. If you are well-maintained, your options for fellatio open up. A girl may be more eager to take your sack of goodies into her oral cave of wonders if it doesn’t result in having wet hair in her mouth. Yes. I hope you are as disgusted as I was while writing that sentence. Wet hair.</p>\n<p>Now, there may be some discomfort when the hair returns if you opt to shave. When it grows back it will prickle and tickle your sensitive giblets. Remember, waxing will mean a) that you won’t have to maintain it for at least a month and b) it will grow back thinner and softer than before. It is a choice only you can make. Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>If you do opt to shave, I recommend the proper set of tools: a good razor dedicated solely to your bits. There is something dehumanizing about shaving your face with a razor that has a pubic hair on it. If you want to be well-prepared, buy Coochy Cream (*insert rambling dialogue by spokesperson of Coochy Cream*). This is a shaving cream dedicated solely to handling your nether-lands. It permits you to shave against the grain which may be easier and it limits shave bumps. Consider it a sexual investment, my friend.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone cares about this stuff. You can adjust according to your partner. Perhaps you’ll land someone who likes the springyness of your bush and has made peace with the initial digging that must occur.</p>\n<p>And ladies, though you are generally better versed in this song and dance, remember that the same rules apply. At the very least, you should maintain your bikini line. Communication is key, people. If you want it from your partner, you need to ask, tactfully. I recommend one of two options that work for me. You can: A) ask if they want something like that from you. It opens the door and makes it reciprocal. “Hey, what are your preferences for how I keep it down there? Do you want it shaved? You do? OK, would you mind doing the same for me?” Or B) “Hey, I think it would be really sexy if you were bare down there …” Mention it offhandedly, flirtatiously. “Imagine all the things we could do …”</p>\n<p>And so, my little horny toads, I leave you with this applicable quote from one of my role models, Dr. Evil of Austin Powers: “There’s nothing quite like a shorn scrotum … It’s breathtaking … I suggest you try it!”</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has better things to do than look for a needle in a haystack.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of the Wednesday, April 24, 2013 print edition of the<em> Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/","id":6353,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6352,6351,6350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Snowflakes, It’s Time to Explore Your Shades of Gray","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This week: “alternative” sexualities and how completely normal they are.

This approach remains a sore subject for me, which is why I think it’s important to take a closer look at how people come to adopt the binary-driven concepts that color our generation’s zeitgeist. I often wonder how people look at the sheer complexity of our world and see any sort of binary. How people are presented with the vast proverbial “gray area” that permeates our Earth, the almost complete lack of “black and white” answers to anything, and still manage to exhibit racism, homophobia, transphobia or what have you, is a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>In fact, the more I study biology, the more I see this “proverbial grayness” present itself in the very building blocks that make up what we know about life. Nothing in biology (at least that I’ve studied so far) amounts to a pure black and white dichotomy. Nothing I’ve studied — from gene interactions to protein-binding events and metabolic pathways — has ever seemed to be a “one or the other” sort of interaction. Individual proteins bind fleetingly fast and at varying strengths; gene regulations occur at tiny timescales and regulate miniscule protein concentrations according to a vast array of environmental factors; metabolic pathways can involve hundreds, if not thousands, of intermediate molecules whose individual concentrations are controlled highly effectively in tandem, and again, at ridiculously small timescales. Thousands of chemical interactions within the body are paired with a thousand more, and those thousands are coupled with yet more. The body is in constant flux, and during development there are so many factors that affect how an organism will grow, learn and interact with the world around it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In light of life’s complexities, it’s shocking that anybody would think so deterministically about anything regarding human psychology. Sexuality and the huge variance that can be seen in human sexual preferences are both results of the intricacy of human development.</p>\n<p>As small children we are constantly told that everyone is a unique and special snowflake and that no two people in the world are ever exactly the same. Well, if everyone is as special and unique as they say, then it really shouldn’t be surprising that the special snowflake you met at that party last weekend can only reach orgasm if she licks another snowflake’s eyeball at climax (it’s called “oculingus,” look it up). If you’ve never heard of oculingus, it’s likely because uncommon and “weird” sexualities get swept under the rug. Just as we don’t berate people for liking the color pink, we shouldn’t make pariahs out of people who do things in the bedroom that we’ve never heard of.</p>\n<p>In researching for my articles I spend all too much time on the internet, and in doing so, I get to read a whole lot of sex columns and bedroom horror stories. Now, reading sex stories from strangers on the internet certainly doesn’t give me a Ph.D. in developmental psychology, nor does it make me a “sexpert.” But it does give me just enough perspective to realize that the variance between peoples’ sex lives and tastes is not only fascinating but beautiful and should be free to be explored by all.</p>\n<p>I’m not a neurobiologist (yet) but in the humble opinion of this biology student-turned-opinion writer, it will be through the study and understanding of neural development that we will ultimately come to know just how complex we are as humans.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration’s decision to invest in the mapping of the human connectome, a feat dubbed “The next great American project,” is sure to yield many answers to fundamental questions about the brain. I think one of these fundamental answers will concern the origin of human sexuality. Ultimately, though, what a roadmap of the human brain will show us is that there are so many different paths to reach the end goal of becoming a grown human being. Thus the idea of treating someone differently because they have sex with other dudes, like dressing in drag or play to a different gender than their physical appearance suggests will seem ludicrous.</p>\n<p>I like to end with calls to action, so I encourage you all to do two things. First, don’t be afraid to explore your own sexualities. Second, don’t be afraid to explore other peoples’, either. You might think it’s weird at first, but when your new partner asks you to lower yourself into that swing for the first time, please don’t forget the ball-gag.</p>\n<p><em>Luc Gendrot embraces, never erases, his computer’s browsing history.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the Wednesday, April 17, 2012 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50881\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50881\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/","id":6345,"author":{"id":456,"name":"Luc Gendrot"},"related":[6344,6343,6342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bitcoin: All That Glitters Isn’t Always Gold","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","description":"On Monday, I accidentally showed up around thirty minutes early to my 12:30 p.m. history class.

The time was just short enough to force me to stay in Phelps Hall, but not long enough to do anything. So I decided to do the usual and crack out my laptop to browse Facebook and Reddit.</p>\n<p>It was pretty much the usual. Friends uploading new pictures, lame memes reposted from Reddit and chuckles about North Korea’s bullshit, but something caught my eye. A thread on /r/economics mentioned Bitcoin, a new all-digital currency championed by libertarians and Tea Partiers as being the digital alternative to the gold standard. This wasn’t the first time I had heard about it — back in February, my friend tried to get me to buy into it when it was still around $2 per digital coin. I didn’t. I thought it was a bubble then, and I know it’s a bubble now. But curiosity got the best of me, and I just had to check the exchange rate to see if I was right.</p>\n<p>“Holy fucking shit!” I nearly jumped out of my seat. I was right, but inconveniently so. Back in February, my friend had tried to suggest that I invest around $500 to buy around 250 in shares, priced at $2. Had I done that, I would now be sitting on 250 shares of Bitcoin now valued at $236, or around $59,000 in estimated worth. “Holy fucking shit” is right.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Back to Facebook, my friend’s News Feed lit up like the Fourth of July, proclaiming the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, and heralding it as the future of digital currency. My cries of warning and temperance went unheeded as he gleefully listed off the soaring price. $175. $185. $231!</p>\n<p>The reason why it was so high was because it was a speculative bubble. Bitcoin was marketed as an alternative to the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro, as being a hard currency that can be used to barter for goods. The advantage is that it is completely free from any central banking monetary policy, so it can increase and decrease at will. This makes it the world’s first universal investing currency to avoid the drags and pitfalls of inflationary and deflationary cycles brought upon by fluctuations in the money supply. Or at least that’s what Bitcoin would have you believe.</p>\n<p>In the opinion of this writer, it’s just a hoax, and I’m not in bad company. Jim Cramer of “Mad Money,” financial analyst Felix Salmon and even Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman had less than stellar things to say about Bitcoin, with Cramer even rejecting it as a currency at all.</p>\n<p>To even be considered a currency, Bitcoin would have had to have been accepted as a medium of exchange, but barring a few examples, virtually no one has done so. Instead, it was quite rapidly identified as a potential bubble by market speculators. They simply wanted to buy enough shares at a low enough price, hoping that some poor sap would buy a few several months down the road at a grossly inflated price. Think of it like buying tickets to the ball game playoffs before the season starts. If your team makes it to the playoffs, you can sell the tickets for a handsome profit. If they don’t, then you’re shit out of luck, unless you can offload it to some poor sap before that. And that’s exactly what’s happening to Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The value of Bitcoin peaked last night at around $260 before falling to $105. In a move that is echoing the housing bubble of 2007-2008, it is slowly climbing back up again, as the “true believers” are in complete denial of Bitcoin’s impending doom. On Reddit’s /r/Bitcoin subreddit, there’s a thread with 755 upvotes titled “Hold Spartans!” with a link to a Photoshopped image of Spartan phalangites sporting Bitcoin shields.</p>\n<p>Back to Facebook, I replied about an hour ago to my friend’s thread. He responded, “Crashed??? Time to buy, buy, buy!” “No… dude,” I chimed back in, “We’re at the first bull trap, and you’re in denial. Sell now, recoup your principle, or get wiped out.” But before I could finish, he replied, “It’s just a bump, not a crash.”</p>\n<p>I doubt that. But it hasn’t stopped people dumping tons of cash into the market, with some even selling their houses to get the requisite cash to invest. I just now have to meditate on the consequences of my action or inaction. On the one hand, I quite clearly didn’t make $59,000, but on the other hand, I didn’t participate in a predatory market strategy.</p>\n<p><em>Kevin de Bree is a third-year history major… and was almost a $59,000-iare.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

And then, yes, some may be blessed with that practiced partner or just a very patient lover who can stroke or lick them to satisfaction. But the rest of us 70 percent-ers (unlucky souls who have to deal with a steep and promising build-up, only to come to the stomach-dropping realization that no, we won’t be getting off tonight) know that once he is done, the whole sex session is done.</p>\n<p>It’d be nice to say that there really shouldn’t be any reason as to why 70 percent of women don’t reach orgasms during their sex-ventures, but that would be a lie. Of course there are reasons, and I’m going to break some down for you:</p>\n<p>1. Girls take much longer to orgasm. Come on, we all know this. Unless the lady pal sports some seriously sensitive sensors, which could, mind you, be both a blessing and a curse, the man must be mentally prepared to spend anywhere from 10 to 30 to 60 minutes on their woman, depending on multiple factors such as the guy’s skill, the girl’s arousability and the level of communication. It’s an investment, yes, but hey, it’s worth it. (Although, I’d like to note that when you please your women, males—and females!—of this planet, they are much more likely to reciprocate your well-spent time and effort. And that could mean many, many things.)</p>\n<p>2. Now I’m not saying this applies to all women, but quite a few of them won’t speak their minds. Maybe it’s due to societal pressure or expectations. Maybe it’s something fostered from the get-go, from 5th grade education on menstrual cycles to 7th grade sex-ed. Guys are more accepted as the Dora Explorers of their sexual preferences and expression of their sexual needs (ironically, I use a female reference). Why is this the case, especially since a lot of men find it hot when their women tell them what to do or take initiative to show how they turn themselves on, and consequently become hard, ready and very much on fire themselves? But that’s exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>3. Here’s why: Many girls are too embarrassed to vocalize their needs, either because a) they don’t want to bruise their man’s ego, b) hell, half of them probably haven’t experimented with themselves enough to know what they like until the guy decides to test it out, and c) you know those grunts and groans and bone-shaking, scream-inducing peaks of passion commonly witnessed in porn, erotica and even romanticized stories from fellow peers? Yeah, they’re usually not accurate. Forget those one-night stands with the fuck-and-flee horndogs; even with regular, well-acquainted lovers, these scenes might still not see the light of day. Nevertheless, girls perceive this to be the norm and, hence, feel scared to admit that they didn’t experience that out-of-this-world sensation. They may feel inadequate; they may think themselves “annoying” and a “sexual hassle” or they may feel “not intense enough.” Regardless, they still aren’t getting that orgasm, and that’s that.</p>\n<p>4. And, frankly, if you just want to cut it down to the blunt and bare: it’s mental, and the girl isn’t feeling it now. By that point, sometimes it’s just too plain fucking awkward for the more soft-spoken, or any-spoken for that matter, to explicitly declare “I put two fingers by the side of my clit and move them like I’m playing a piano trill” or “Can you rub your palm on the top and then curl your middle and ringfingers into a u-shape and sort of press there—no wait, there, ah—I mean, no not like that—wait, ugh, stop.” Right. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are multiple ways to go about this, and I have yet to perfect this deal myself. First, however, foreplay must not be ignored. Watch some steamy videos, engage in long-desired fantasies, talk dirty. Anything that works because, after all, a good portion of sex is mental. Furthermore, angles matter. It is said that two inches is actually enough to take the girl to her heavenly heights due to the fact that most of her nerves are bundled up toward the entrance of the vagina.</p>\n<p>Most often than not, however, the biggest solution to the neglected climax is just forcing yourself to communicate. I hate telling any woman to “man up” because that phrase is atrociously incorrect in more ways than one, but in the figurative sense behind the phrase, yes, toughen up that resolve. Lift up that chin. Life normally won’t hand you gems and jewels in a treasure chest; it just chucks you little poop pellets. Therefore, as is logical, we need to shake off that nervous hesitation and be strong with stating what we want, what we need and what will make us happy.</p>\n<p>So, 70 percent, I challenge you. Maybe that “thirst-quenching, tsunami wave-surging” orgasm won’t come right away, but it’s definitely there, lurking on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>R.

Every CC, CSU, and UC has had their own slate of issues laid down and divided by the state’s board of education. Most of us are familiar with the UC’s plight of regental reform, tax hikes, and shrinking of financial aid vouchers. However, looking at the broader picture of issues staring down at the CSU and CC calls to question how some issues may be shared. Proposition 30, being the partial bandage of the entire California higher-education system was aimed to be shared among the three separate bodies.</p>\n<p>CSU’s focused these funds on increasing technology usage, enhancing outreach programs, and stopping unwanted tuition spikes. With the Prop 30 awarding a safety net of $125 million to the Cal State budget, students will be temporarily refunded by tuition waivers. However, the Cal State system will not be able to avoid making faculty and administration cuts to further balance their budget. CC’s are battling with class overflow, availability, faculty ratio, and a recently introduced course drop fee.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The resemblance of budgetary reform and fiscal responsibility among state legislators has been called to question numerous times. Student advocates have marched together and have called out the state on many occasions. Yet, apart from the “March in March,” there has not been collaboration in any organized fashion to help represent the three tiers of education in our state. This call to question has been recognized but no formal action has been taken until last year. I am a transfer student from both a CC and Four Year Institution. I have felt first-hand the dissemblance and fracture of the CA students on the ground level. I decided to bring this to the UCSA’s attention and pitch it as a formal endorsable resolution at the summer conference in 2012. It turned out that a few of my colleagues at UCR and UCLA had the exact same idea. After discussing the idea further, we decided to create a formal union of college students similar to the structure of the UCSA. However, this new organization would involve student leaders from all tiers of education in CA. We got the idea at the conference to title the organization (C.A.U.C.U.S.), which stands for the California Union of College and University Students. This union would call representatives from each assembly district to send a student leader from that region. Since there are more CC’s and CSU’s than UC’s the organization is going to extend to every region that may not include UC’s. In addition to these representatives, there are special delegate liaison from the SSCCC, CSSA, and UCSA. With a diverse and widespread board of representatives tackling issues of commonality can be objective to the needs of all students in the CA education system.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Senator Jackson, Assemblyman Williams, and many other representative allies we have a solid “YES,” to continue building this CA Student Union. At this point we are looking for feedback, advocates, and motivators to help make this idea into reality. I am pretty curious as to what my fellow Gauchos think about this, (as we are the most spirited campus that drives the UC.) Regardless of how long this takes I promise that this will happen. There is always a better chance to fight for what students believe in when we stand together. The choice is ours….</p>\n<p>STAND UNITED OR FALL DIVIDED!</p>\n<p><em>Sam Swift is a third-year political science and acting double major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at<em> dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/","id":5964,"author":{"id":487,"name":"Sam Swift"},"related":[5963,5962,5961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Returns from Convention Jazzed on US-Israeli Relations, Weary of Iran","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos for Israel is a bipartisan group of student activists and campus leaders educated to be confident advocates for Israel on our UCSB campus.

It is a pro US-Israel relations group that aims to promote and strengthen the bond between the United States and Israel. Through our involvement in pro-Israel politics, we interact with key political figures, build strong relationships and ultimately help influence policy-makers both in the present and for the future.</p>\n<p>Along with other members of Gauchos for Israel, I was privileged to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) three-day Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. which hosts 13,000 participants including 2000 students from all fifty states. I returned feeling not only more educated but also truly inspired to act.</p>\n<p>The convention offered a plethora of opportunities to hear distinguished speakers and attend breakout sessions that facilitated panel discussions. I was humbled by words of esteemed political leaders such as Senator John McCain, Israel’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, Vice President Joe Biden and even Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via live video satellite). The breakout sessions were informational seminars led by experts in the field covering a variety of issues regarding the relationship between the United States and Middle Eastern nations. The session that most resonated with me was one entitled, “Sanctions Report Card: Can Economic Pressure Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Iran’s continued development of nuclear weapons, despite warnings from other countries, is an issue that is rapidly escalating. Regardless of Iran’s failing economy, they still remain persistent in their efforts. The United States has realized that this is not only a key problem to the State of Israel, but it also poses a security threat to the U.S. as well. In response, the Obama administration is currently implementing strict sanctions on Iran, most recently a unilateral trade sanction, H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013.</p>\n<p>Honorable Daniel Glaser, Assistant Secretary for terrorist financing in the United States Department of the Treasury, explained that this would target Iran’s ability to access the international finance system. Any country purchasing oil from Iran must now pay in its own currency, and Iran is no longer allowed to exchange this currency for its own. In addition, sanctions from the U.S. are threatened for any country that deals directly with the Iranian bank. The H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was passed on February 6, 2013, and will have a huge impact on Iran’s already damaged economy.</p>\n<p>Even though many point to Iran’s evasion of sanctions through loopholes, Glaser reassured that the intelligence office is maintaining a close watch on Iran. Congress is also debating alternative options such as a viable military threat. Once Iran obtains nuclear capabilities, there is no reverting the fact that they could produce an atomic bomb at any given moment.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel must work together to do all that is possible to prevent this precarious situation from confronting the international arena. Having studied abroad in Israel for four months, I feel that this issue not only affects Israeli citizens, but the American general public as well. As an American citizen, I deeply believe in the importance of a strong and united front against a potentially nuclear capable Iran.</p>\n<p>This conference as a whole made me realize how supportive the United States truly is toward its relationship with Israel. Hearing political leaders speak of their reliance on Israel and vice versa was incredibly empowering. I feel proud as an American to be helping to contribute to the safety of not only the citizens of Israel, but the security of the United States as well. I strongly believe that the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong, and will only continue to strengthen in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Ariel Brotman is a third-year psychology and Middle East studies Major.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50695\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50695\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/","id":5970,"author":{"id":488,"name":"Abriel Brotman"},"related":[5969,5968,5967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Quel Your Horn With Porn:  The Merits of Spending Some “Me Time” in Cyberspace","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"To begin, I like porn.

As your dedicated Humptress, it is my duty to divulge this to you. You may now sigh in relief. You are now either more holy than I and abstain or one of my brethren. What a cozy atmosphere we’ve established for ourselves. Porn is very interesting because it varies so greatly between individuals. And it is highly taboo in its nature, of course. More than once I have casually brought it up to my friends and more often than not, they get this peculiar halting look, like, “Oh, wait, you just hit the sharing wall.” NAY. I say we’re going to Kool-Aid Man that wall up in dis bitch! I’m going to rant to you on why porn rocks and why you should chill out and swallow all of these deep-seeded worries you have buried inside of you (hehe).</p>\n<p>I think porn is the most personal thing people have in relation to their sexual life. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they are not really getting any, but are instead indulging their base desires in secret. Heaven forbid people see what you do in secret. It’s so often associated with deviant behavior. Let’s amend that. It’s just another form of kink, especially if you and an adventurous partner want to have your own personal viewing session.<br>\nMany girls seem uncomfortable with porn, which is silly. Maybe this is due to a lack of female advertising on porn websites, among other things. We know that most every guy out there has a substantial porn folder on their computer, hidden under something like, “Dull Trip to Kansas, Totally Not Worth Opening.” I think girls are more worried about what other girls will think, which is also dumb. I personally would rather engage in some scintillating media than have the pristine approval of women everywhere.<br>\nIt’s important to realize that the porn does not easily translate to the real world. Don’t treat your partner like she’s a pornstar. She will not thank you when you decide you want to copy the bukakke video you were watching last night just because the pornstar seemed enthused. It’s a lie. However, ladies, if you indulge in porn from time to time, it can be a valuable asset in your sex life. If you do decide to emulate things you see in porn, it often goes very well. His eyes will bug out, glazed and delighted, as he flashes back to the vigorous fapping he indulged in the night prior. “Hot damn, she knows what she’s doing,” he will think, in much fewer words (signified by “guh-huuuuuhh”).<br>\nIf you are comfortable and you have a regular partner, I think it would be healthy to tell them about your preferences, especially if you think it will open doors to things you want to try together. This does not apply to everyone. The type of porn some people watch is not reflective of what they would actually like to do. There is no freaking way I want to try many of the things I have encountered in my porn viewing. So don’t judge yourself or others based on the weird shit they watch. The more you watch and dabble, the more you find out what you like. Naturally, there are some types of porn that deserve thorough judging, which I feel I don’t need to describe.<br>\nIt’s fun.<br>\nI like to think of porn as literature for sex. If you want to learn how to do the Macarena, you look up a YouTube video. If you want to learn how to twerk while on top, you watch porn. It’s academic, goddammit.<br>\nSometimes you hit a dry spell. Instead of becoming a born-again virgin due to a lack of suitors, hit up those naughty pop-ups.<br>\nAs I’ve said before, I don’t think you should be afraid of sex or your sexuality. So just try it out. I’m not saying abandon real-life sex for your Internet mistress, Betsy Onnerback, but simply familiarize yourself with the different types of sex and sexual interests that are out there. Ultimately, go get ideas, get comfortable, but don’t get a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>As you know, my little chickadees, I like to assign you all homework. One night this week, I encourage you to schedule some “me time.” I recommend any of the following websites: pornhub.com, tube8.com, or fucd.com (for the entire compilation of every type of individual interest).

Suddenly, there, among the filth of the fiesta, shines a vision. Angelic vocals reach a crescendo. All who witness are breathless with delight. Das’ right, folks, it’s chicks making out.</p>\n<p>There’s something oddly hypnotizing about this action. If two members of the opposite sex are playing a game of tonsil hockey, not an eyelash is batted (unless there is some sort of personal connection to the couple in question). However, when two girls kiss, it often seems to evoke a delightful fascination.</p>\n<p>Allow me to illustrate the various points regarding the reasons I enjoy kissing girls:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Girls are soft, pretty and smell nice. It’s really hit or miss with you boys. Some of you are hippies and believe that means you never have to wash your hair. You’re wrong. You may still be pretty, but you probably don’t smell too nice, do you?</p>\n<p>I have never had a bad girl-kiss. Well, save for sophomore year when my friend jumped on me while blacked out and banged her teeth into mine. But most times, girls just know how to use the appropriate amount of tongue. Guys, on the other hand, either tongue appropriately or get way too liberal. Less is more, fellas. Seriously. It should be a tease, a light tracing, a “hello” from tongue to tongue, not an all-caps “OH HAY DERE.”</p>\n<p>Between girlfriends, there’s an innocent enjoyment to the kiss. There’s no threat, no tongue siege. It’s just kissing for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>So go on, ladies, get a little tipsy and goofy with your gal pals and exchange a peck or two. No one takes these things seriously; it’s a form of play. Don’t get so in-your-head about these things.</p>\n<p>It is important I specify that I personally don’t condone kissing as a show. If you want to kiss another girl and there happen to be people around, fuck it. But if you’re being that drunk girl who’s doing it with the hopes of making guys stare at you, it will likely work but also make you look immature.</p>\n<p>And don’t be that guy. You all know him: He’s the one who goes up to the two girls like, “Hey, shall I join you ladies?” Dude, you will be ignored. Just admire the beauty of the situation and remain silent. You are a man amidst nature, witnessing two unicorns going at it. Don’t disturb the majesty.</p>\n<p>Now, on top of all of this, there are, of course, social politics that go into making out with members of the same gender. To cite renowned sexologist Alfred Kinsey, one’s sexuality can be viewed as a point on a sexual gradient rather than confined to a certain category of sexuality. I think we can all appreciate and agree with this statement. Kinsey also found that, along this gradient, females are the more fluid of the two genders. They can be closer to the middle, at times. When girls get drunk and make out, it’s not necessarily because they identify as bisexual. I’ve made out with a fair number of my female friends. Often it’s something close friends do when they reach a certain level of shwasted. I wouldn’t make out with my roommate normally. But throw some booze in the situation, and suddenly there are three girls kissing at once.</p>\n<p>What’s fascinating to me is that despite partaking in a little tongue waggling, none of the girls I’ve kissed would identify as bisexual or lesbian. It’s purely for enjoyment. I would describe the atmosphere as one of playful innocence — naughty but fun. Now here is the odd thing to me: If two guys got hammered and started making out, the same social rules often would not apply. I am not saying this is fair. I am not saying this is something people unanimously agree upon. But if two guys were making out at a party, most would instantly assume they were bisexual or homosexual, right? If it was a joke, I could dig it. However, if it was carried out in the same fashion that my female friends and I do our kissing (i.e. enjoying one another and ignoring the populace) then I must admit, I would be turned off by both males. They would not be potential candidates for sending their deep v-diver into my ocean blue. Many girls I speak to agree (with the exception of the female friend whose eyes brightened as she cried out with delight, “Threesome!”).</p>\n<p>Now, things are certainly gearing toward that sort of behavior being more acceptable. I think that’s healthy and exciting. Norms are shifting! Huzzah! But at this point, there is still that frustrating tilt in male versus female social codes. If a girl invites multiple suitors into her boudoir, you assume that eventually it’ll be like throwing a hot dog into a hallway. But if a guy does the same, smoldering at da’ bitches before getting down, no worries, he’s just another playa’. These are the typical standards of our time. But still, in comparison to what our mums and dads faced, this is significant progress. Consider this: 30 years ago, you were a slut if you put out before five dates. I hear people moaning and groaning about having to wait for three.</p>\n<p>So my sweetlings, dabble in some smooching of the sisters and enjoy getting fresh with your lady bros. Experimentation is a healthy, integral part of the college experience. Eventually the realms of experimentation may continue to expand to be more inclusive. Party on, my gaping-gobbed Gauchos, and Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. is immune to the drunchies.
