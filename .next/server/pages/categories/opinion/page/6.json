There are so many different ways to experience pleasure, and anal is one of them for more people than you’d think. While it may seem a little intimidating at first, with a little preparation, some practice, open communication and industrial amounts of lube, you should be sliding your way to a new experience in no time.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a common misconception that </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anal sex can only be pleasurable for those who have a prostate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; however, regardless of gender, the anal cavity is filled with nerve endings. What people are most familiar with in terms of anal stimulation is the prostate gland, which is located at the bottom of the bladder, just in front of the rectum. And I only know that because I watched this</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Ayq248u_8\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the opening to the anus is where most of the nerve endings are, stimulating the prostate is what is often most pleasurable and can even result in prostate-induced orgasms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those without a prostate, anal sex can still be enjoyable. Similar to vaginal sex, the clitoris is stimulated during anal sex. While a large portion of the clitoris is external, there is a portion that extends inside that is stimulated during anal sex and can cause clitoral orgasms. Some have even claimed having stronger orgasms during anal penetration than vaginal penetration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I will admit anal sex isn’t for everyone, I do think it is something you should try if you are curious. That being said, if you are going to try, it is extremely important to be prepared. Part of that preparation is finding a partner you are not only comfortable with, but someone you feel you can have an open line of communication with. Trying anal will be painful at first for whomever is being penetrated, so it’s important for each partner to be aware of how the other is feeling. Open communication will help both partners figure out what is most pleasurable for each of you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to finding your partner, there are a few other steps to take into consideration. A primary concern for people trying anal sex for the first time is cleanliness. While a little poop here and there should be expected, it is not something to worry about. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a17749/anal-sex-misconceptions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most fecal matter sits above the anus and rectum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some people choose to use anal douching, but many are fine with just taking a little extra time to wash in and around the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also extremely important to stay relaxed and go slow during the act. Part of the reason anal sex hurts is due to tensing up. Let your body calm down and start with something small. Some people start with fingers or toys and then move to bigger things, such as butt plugs. Going slow will not only help prevent tearing but will also help build arousal. Before any penetration, however, make sure you are using lots of lube!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you take anything away from this article it should be that preparation will enhance your anal experience. There are a lot of resources online, but it’s important to remember that everyone’s bodies are different. To help you get started here are some tips on anal </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips/a6574/buttplay-for-the-wary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foreplay</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. ;)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>My boss keeps hitting on me :( How do I get him to stop? I’m already dating someone else.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, I am so sorry you are going through this. Regardless of whether or not you are dating someone, this behavior is inappropriate and unfair, and you should not feel as if you need to justify your feelings about the situation. At the end of the day, his actions are making you uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say at this point it is most important for you to identify exactly what behaviors are making you uncomfortable. It could just be him hitting on you, but oftentimes that behavior is accompanied by other actions that could contribute to the discomfort as well, e.g. being passive-aggressive when you shut down his attempts or unwanted forms of physical affection. There is a laundry list of possibilities, and identifying these behaviors will make it easier for you to articulate the situation and how it has created an unsustainable work environment for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I usually err on the side of confrontation, I think in situations like these direct confrontation is not always the best option for everyone. I would, however, advise you to tell someone who has the power to change the situation, even if it isn’t your boss directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every workplace there should  be someone who is responsible for handling these situations. Normally, this person works in the human resources (HR) department; however, if you are unsure who specifically handles these situations, the HR department is a good place to start. Whomever you end up speaking with should be able to explain all of your options and help you decide what is best for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think confronting your boss is the best option, make sure you are clear about which behaviors make you uncomfortable. This should not come off as a threat, but your boss should know that if his behavior doesn’t stop you will have to speak with someone else. This is never an easy thing to do, but remember that being comfortable in your workplace is not a privilege but a right.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/aj/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">AJ</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>AJ is the advice guru of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em>If you know who she is, keep it to yourself.

These tech industries thought the cord of the standard earphones were essential to keeping them safe. Despite conflicting beliefs, AirPods have taken flight on our campus and have grown into a prominent status symbol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are much more expensive than other headphones, but they still have a special, attractive quality that elevates them above alternatives. With a price tag of $159, AirPods are a little more expensive than Powerbeats3, which cost around $100. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, </span><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/airpods-upgrade-2019-all-new-design-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16 million AirPods were sold in 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and approximately 55 million AirPods will have been sold by the end of 2019. This upward trend proves that AirPods will continue to be a desirable product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are becoming a cultural phenomenon and gaining widespread support. But are people buying AirPods just to gain elite status or for the convenience factor? With AirPods all around us, it’s difficult to distinguish the real reasons why people choose to own them. But I think social pressure and social status are a big part of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are still some who have not given in to the pressure, like Audrey Francis, a first-year communication major at UCSB. Francis says that AirPods are “expensive and unnecessary” and does not enjoy “the way the plastic Apple [headphones] feel.” She believes that on campus, AirPods “give you some kind of clout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, they mean a lot to people because they are an investment and allow them to listen to music. AirPods are a polarizing piece of technology and there is a continuous debate about whether or not they are even worth the hype.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, there is controversy surrounding Apple products versus non-Apple products. Some may say that Apple products are desirable solely due to their popularity. On the other hand, some argue that non-Apple products are of higher quality, and that the power of brand recognition means Apple doesn’t need to place as much emphasis on quality.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There tends to be a lot of backlash against people who choose to stick with the “inferior” technology, and many even consider Android phones to be lesser than their Apple competitors. Have you ever been put in a group chat with someone who has an Android? That person gets so much hate for the little green text bubbles that pop up on everyone’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">glorious </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone screens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tiny green text bubbles shouldn’t be linked to lower status but in reality, they are. There is always a small assumption that not having the most popular technology is due to one’s low economic status. Yet many fail to consider that even if someone is able to afford an iPhone, they may choose to go with another option due to personal preference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our society has advanced immensely in terms of technology. A phone itself is no longer a status symbol, even though it should be. In other countries, owning a phone — regardless of the brand — is a symbol of good economic standing. Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major factor that influences people to buy AirPods is social status, just as much as function or convenience. No one wants to seem poor, so they go along with trends. And not having the cord of your headphones get jumbled with your keys might just be a plus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anum Damani wants individuals to be cautious when buying expensive Apple products and to not succumb to social pressures. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ad14fdb517f77521daf410a0c8d9515?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ad14fdb517f77521daf410a0c8d9515?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anum-damani/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anum Damani</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anum Damani is a mathematical sciences major who loves having conversations about astrology.

Everyone says bare feet are more prone to infections, but no one thinks about the detrimental health effects of shoes (unstable ankles and joints, blisters and deformed feet). Researchers are now </span><a href=\"https://dermalmedix.com/walking-barefoot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that earthing may be just as good for your body as it is for your spirit. Yet, for most of our generation, shoes seem to be first and foremost about style rather than comfort, let alone orthopedic concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even if it’s healthy, are there any educational or recreational benefits? This is not at all about what y’all are thinking: kinky sexual fetishes. At least not for all of us earthers. Instead, it is a search for universal human happiness. Ask yourselves: Have you recently spent a shoeless afternoon in the park with your loved ones? Have you ever driven a stick shift barefoot? Ever cracked open a cold one with your toes? Alright, alright, maybe not all of that, Mrs. Grundy. But at the end of the day we can agree that the best thing about shoes is taking them off once you get home. I was told it’s almost like the getting-rid-of-your-bra sensation: Freedom, comfort and protection by and through your bare body.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not only about liberation, though. Earthing is about the awareness of human waste, cigarette butts and broken beer bottles on the street. At the same time, we are all equal (or equally gross) without shoes as opposed to the luxury, high prices and social pressure associated with them. In many cases, there might be a pinch of arrogance involved with feeling alternative and good about yourself because no one else does it. But just imagine a world where we’d all do it. Without any artificial feet protection, we would naturally care more about hygiene and pollution and less about looks or material beauty because our health would be dependent on a clean environment.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                                                                  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a study abroad student, my attitude towards dress, and particularly footwear, in I.V. is similar to performing at drunken Wednesday karaoke nights at Rockfire. There’s room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares. And this is not just due to favorable geographical conditions of beaches, fields and forests. It is because of UCSB’s liberal student body, the fact that there are surfboard racks in front of residence halls and people wearing flip-flops to class. With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing haters usually base their arguments around comfort, hygiene and looks. Granted, the library is a sacred space of learning and reflection for some of our fellow humans. But then, how is earthing different from unpacking your smelly Subway meatball marinara sub in the eighth floor quiet rooms? Once your interpretation of personal freedom infringes on someone else’s, asking politely for permission is in order, whether it’s fast food or your extremities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And seriously, how are bare feet really that different from bare hands? Are we having a glove debate too? I doubt it. This hints at the importance of social constructivism regarding the norms and shared societal expectations of “civilized” behaviour. This is not to demand all-out nudity but to provide some impetus to think about the boundaries we have created. Essentially, we give behaviour and style meaning through our everyday discourse and the persistence of unquestioned traditional taboos. Let’s just forget about the whole shoe madness for a second and take off our fussy socks, both physically and mentally.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages students and staff to think beyond socially-constructed boundaries and choose nature over materialism.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88168\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88168\" data-attachment-id=\"88168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/argument-in-the-office-is-barefooting-an-acceptable-practice/shoes-nexus-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=650%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shoes-nexus-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88168\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?resize=650%2C366\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>No Such Thing as the Right to Bare Feet</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Kat Chen</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My opponent Mr. Ahrens has given not only his opinion but has also slipped in gentle words of insidious guidance towards this Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile practice. Simon hails from Göttingen, Germany by way of England. His year of exchange in the U.S. gives him, in his own words, “room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I care, Simon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hobbesian ideals of human freedom locked so seamlessly into our revolutionary founding texts lure millions of hopeless romantics like Simon to see this country as a land of exploration. I am tired of white men frolicking through Isla Vista barefoot like the world is their backyard: it began with Columbus, with Lewis and Clark, with Neil Armstrong. The set of soil-crusted toenails perched next to my ear in Pollock Theater is new wave Manifest Destiny. But these “earthers” do not explore uncharted waters or unknown lands. They are not lunar heroes of the Cold War. They are only the disciples of a false gospel, victims to their own disgusting faith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much ink has been spilt lauding the joys of being barefoot. On a hot day in mid-July, I can imagine plunging my feet into the beachy banks of a quiet lake, my toes wiggling through the baked surface to reach the wet sand underneath. On an endless stretch of grass, I see myself prying off both shoes and socks, lying down and letting scratchy sprouts envelop me, head to toe. In the tenderness of my own home, I will sit, criss-cross applesauce, nothing between my soles and the green plush of my carpet. The simplicity of these pleasures must be the source of inspiration for earthing. My sympathies end there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon argues that I have caved to the “norms and shared societal expectations of ‘civilized’ behaviour.” He has basically called me, and all of us who wear shoes, sheeple. While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed. There’s a reason we cyberbully flat-earthers, climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers: for the good of the herd and for the safety of future generations, we must uphold truths that serve to propel progress. Shoes protect us from tetanus, I.V.’s balmy 42-degree weather and street vomit from last Thursday. They act as a buffer between the outside world and the inside, marking clear boundaries between where public spaces end and personal ones begin. The eschewing (e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing? Ha!) of these thresholds is a privilege exploited by the barefoot of Isla Vista. Most of the responses to my post on our Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page seeking earthers were written by, you guessed it, white students. Remember: “No Shoes, No Service” does not apply equally to all who roam shoeless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing’s health claims, based on the alleged power of electrons from the ground to counteract the body’s free radicals (to treat anything from depression to cancer), cling to studies like</span> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one from 2012, co-authored by Stephen Sinatra, a co-author of “Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever!” by Clinton Ober, Sinatra and Martin Zucker. Despite the study’s complete ignorance of “correlation does not equal causation,” earthing is now a small empire, with a vast offering of official Earthing® products targeted towards its cult of believers. Yours for the hot deal of only $69.99, the Earthing Wearables Kit comes with, unbelievably, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">socks</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For your feet. To wear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The claim that earthing is “the most important health discovery ever” isn’t doing wonders for its reputation either. To prove their proclaimed faith to revert to a Paleolithic age, I invite earthers to renounce all modern medicine: the smallpox vaccine, the MRI, even their eyeglasses. If they can’t read the slides, maybe they’ll stop attending my lectures. Maybe then the calloused, punctured, reeking, selfish symbol of American liberty will finally stop encroaching on my minimal expectations of personal freedoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I would never get into your car if you insisted on driving stick shift barefoot.

This might seem obvious, as the people we elect should reflect our own personal beliefs and values. Because this idea speaks loudly to what we Americans truly value, inappropriate behavior towards anybody should not be tolerated, ever, especially from someone in the highest possible position of power in our country. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the allegations against Trump are far more horrific than those against Biden, another major difference between the two is our perceptions of their actions. Across many circles, Trump is known for being a lifelong capitalist and irresponsible businessman; he is not considered a “nice guy,” which is obvious from the way left-wing news sources like </span><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/clinton-trump-led-people-to-be-more-sexist-and-misogynistic-1047128643921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MSNBC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> criticize him. As for me, I have never expected anything from Trump in regard to “niceness” because, well, I never really placed him on a pedestal. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2020. His actions, seen as something that reflects his age or a generational difference, are not treated in the same manner as Trump’s transgressions. Why? Because when it comes down to it, most citizens still see Joe Biden as a “nice guy.” And for these type of men, this behavior is completely acceptable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Biden might come across as a nice old man who is BFFs with Obama, he fails to conduct himself in a way that is up to presidential standards.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is evident in Biden’s handling of the Anita Hill case from his time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1991, Professor Anita Hill alleged that Clarence Thomas </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-was-in-charge-of-the-anita-hill-hearing-even-he-says-it-wasnt-fair/2019/04/26/a9a6f384-6500-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.48f1bf2ab6ec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexually harassed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> her when he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As he was a Supreme Court nominee, the case went to the Senate for a hearing. However, the controversy largely came to revolve around </span><a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/guide-joe-biden-anita-hill-controversy.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biden’s mishandling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the hearings, which ranged from confusing questions to inappropriate comments from other senators. Since then, Biden has failed to apologize for not controlling the hearing and for allowing for the mistreatment of Hill because of the biased opinions of senators. Especially in the midst of the #MeToo movement, do we really want a president that fails to give women an opportunity to share their story? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What many of us fail to realize is that “nice guys” can be creeps too. Being nice to your grandma or your teachers does not give these guys the right to act inappropriately toward others — especially women. Being in a position of power does not give “nice guys” an excuse to touch a woman without her consent. We need to start asking ourselves what we truly want out of our elected officials. Although the characteristics Americans value may differ, many want politicians to practice what they preach. Although Biden might come across as a nice old man who is BFFs with Obama, he fails to conduct himself in a way that is up to presidential standards. For this reason, the public should be more critical of his behavior and the Democratic Party should not endorse him in the 2020 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what party you lean towards, as citizens we should expect more of the candidates we choose. We should not vote for someone because they seem like the best of the worst, like many did with former Secretary Clinton in 2016 or vote for someone who is incapable of keeping his hands off of the women around him. As a Democrat, I expect my party to be as infuriated with Biden’s behavior as they are with Trump’s. Although their actions might be of different calibers, they still reflect their attitudes toward women. It is not about different generations or a difference in perception; it is about 2020 being the year that we students vote for someone who represents the qualities we look for in our friends, peers and within ourselves, because these nice guys? They’re really just creeps. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley hopes that in the 2020 election voters will not elect a creep into office </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> again. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately one in five women and one in 16 men </span><a href=\"https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be sexually assaulted in college</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only around 10% of survivors report their assaults to law enforcement. This is due to a number of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator/associates/friends and the hesitation to put oneself through the physically and emotionally invasive process of reporting. Now the despicable allegations against the community’s own police force is another contributing factor that survivors must consider before choosing to report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sexual assault is a crime based on power dynamics. As an inherently powerful figment in the community, the UCPD is exacerbating that power imbalance by allegedly exploiting people who have been physically, mentally and emotionally violated. They have allegedly abused their power to prey on and mock people who have sought their aid, people who are hopeful that their power can help serve justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations against officers in our own community are exponentially detrimental to the relationship that the police will have with UCSB students and I.V. residents in the months and years to come. The damage is done; the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-calling-for-disarmament-of-campus-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inherent community distrust of the police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is only heightened by these claims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a society plagued with </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/20-25-reported-rapes-in-isla-vista-over-3-year-period-csd-report-finds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looming statistics of sexual violence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our police should be beacons of support and justice. Instead they allegedly mock victims of assault, joking about the immense suffering and trauma that they endure. These alleged actions minimize and invalidate the experiences of survivors and, in turn, create a toxic environment that discourages reporting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College communities are particularly privy to sexual assault, and if these allegations are true, it is impossible to quantify the number of people that the UCPD has hurt over the years with their callous mockery of people who are courageous enough to come to them seeking help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are not the only people who are left feeling as though they had nowhere to turn (if they even still considered the police worth going to for help). The officers named in the lawsuit also allegedly made derogatory comments against people of color (including students and faculty). Officer Michael Little allegedly spoke of a fantasy in which a Black man attempts to rob him: “Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I passed by the department after the article’s publication I was left with chills down my spine and goosebumps on my arms. When we hear horrific stories of insidious actions carried out by cops, it often feels removed, if we are lucky enough to have that privilege. But now, face to face with the police building, if true, it is disturbing to realize what inexcusable behavior allegedly took place inside its unassuming walls. It is disturbing to realize how many people we know were hurt by the reported comments, stereotyping and mockery made behind those doors. These are the cops we see out on the streets at night after parties. We </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-11/not-your-exotic-babe-navigating-i-v-as-ethnically-ambiguous/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">say nothing when they hit on us</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or when they give us trouble because we know better than to pick a fight with a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some cops in the community seem like they try to relate to the younger-skewing demographic of the I.V. community. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself even had a column from as recent as late 2015 run by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/category/question-authority-opinion/?fbclid=IwAR3qwzs0f31uJvbwKBJh7RW0vsnTX4tH7zqwMBDY8taPJU6PW0-Yqu1T5kM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Mark Signa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against UCPD and frequently negatively mentioned in another. Even if Lt. Signa is unfairly portrayed in these allegations, the alleged “Good Ole Boys’ Club” fostered within the UCPD seems to have contributed heavily to the normalization of this culture of toxicity that has run rampant in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, the reputation of the UCSB UCPD could be irreparably damaged; there’s a chance the community will never look at the UCPD in the same way again. I find it deeply ironic that the department, which has recently contributed to a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/i-v-and-santa-barbara-groups-address-sexual-violence-in-video-series/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series of videos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extolling sentiments of belief and support for survivors, is facing such disturbing allegations regarding the dehumanization of victims of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, these allegations will likely be widely believed by the community. The department should not have tried to bury these allegations that go back several years; instead, they should have made a statement in an effort of transparency. These allegations never would have seen the light of day had members of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not physically gone through court records to find them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations and the effort to hide them from the public eye will alter the UCPD’s relationship with the community for years — if not decades — to come, and that will hurt the students above anyone else.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anonymous thinks that UCSB students deserve a police force that does not diminish the experiences of vulnerable and marginalized communities.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/","id":5636,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[5635,5634,5633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Life and Death in a Nutshell","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Flesh Prison","publish_date":"2019-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2048-e1557294803721.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2048-e1557294803721.jpg?resize=650%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Harper Lambert writes about living with a fatal food allergy and the surprising lessons she learned along the way.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Try this, it’s delicious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting on the table before me, she looks innocuous enough </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seductive, even.

Two bites into a baguette smeared with vegan cream cheese (what did I tell you?), the alarm bells started ringing. All the telltale signs were there: the itchiness on my tongue; the feeling of sand filling my throat as it constricts; my lips going pillowy with numbness; my swollen eyelids reducing my eyes to slits; and worst of all, the panic that sends adrenaline pinballing through my body, drumming up my heart rate and alighting every nerve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, the first ingredient listed was “RAW CASHEWS.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A moment of callousness and two bites of cream cheese. That’s all it took to launch my immune system into shutdown and my body into the bathroom, where I spent the next hour with my head in the toilet. This time I got lucky: With the aid of some Benadryl, my breathing returned to normal and the vomiting subsided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a thousand ways this situation could have played out, a thousand parallel universes determined by a single detail. What if I hadn’t been with friends who live minutes away from a drugstore? What if I’d been at a party surrounded by strangers? Or in a foreign country? What if my body went into </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anaphylaxis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I didn’t have my </span><a href=\"https://www.epipen.com/what-is-anaphylaxis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Epi-Pen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with me? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have experienced all of these scenarios in some form or another. From hives at holiday parties to barfing at the beach, I’ve seen it all. So it goes without saying that I am grateful my most recent reaction didn’t land me in the hospital, or worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, a tiny, irrational part of me wishes it did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, there is a disparity — a chasm, really — between the emotional and physical scars left by a traumatic event. Each time, my body outpaces my mind in the recovery process; my eyes de-puff before my tears dry. My allergy is life-threatening, meaning that every time I have a reaction, I am faced with the possibility of my own death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That such a serious medical condition is called an “allergy” strikes me as wildly inappropriate. “Allergy” is a silly word that conjures up images of snot-nosed kids and springtime pollen. It undercuts the terror that seizes me when I realize that something tastes “off.” It makes it difficult for others to empathize with my experiences. No, I don’t live with chronic pain or have to inject myself with medicine on a daily basis. Yes, I am otherwise healthy and able-bodied. But when you live your whole life thinking you could die at any meal, it takes an emotional toll.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the more drastic the reaction, the easier it is to cope with it. In the wake of a reaction fraught with dramatic details — pastries, Greece, family vacation, deserted island, paramedic tent, no Epi-Pen — I received an outpouring of sympathy from my friends and family. The intensity of their concern matched the misery of the experience. However, this was an exception, not the rule. Reactions that occur under ordinary circumstances, such as Sunday brunch, don’t elicit the same response even though they are no less terrifying for me. This can be extremely isolating, to say the least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feeling of being heard but not understood makes me want to exaggerate the details of my reactions the way I sometimes embellish stories, a trait at which my friends and family often poke fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck by this as I lay in bed after the Bad Brunch, snapping me out of my post-reaction slump. Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My allergy and I have been attached since birth, our fates tied together by the pad thai noodles that sent me to the hospital at age one. I can’t remember living without it, and </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data indicates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I probably never will. Which means that for better or worse, my nut allergy is woven into the fabric of my being. If personalities are like smoothies — a random blend of family, culture, DNA and environment — who’s to say it wasn’t a formative ingredient? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some manifestations are positive, highlighting aspects of my personality that may have otherwise remained in the shadows. I was always a precocious child, the kind that enjoyed talking to adults and hogged the camera in all the home videos. Yet my engraved emergency bracelet was my first real taste of the spotlight. I would shake my chubby fist at anyone who would listen, reveling in the attention it garnered me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I graduated from bracelet-waving to bragging, as if being in constant latent danger was cool. I feel lucky for myself and my parents that I was such an obnoxious kid, never hesitating to announce my allergy to anyone offering me food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also credit my allergy for my Doomsday Prepper tendencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have to carry a chunky plastic medicine stick and 1-2 tablets of Benadryl with you everywhere, you become one of those people who anticipates disaster at every turn. I have since blossomed into a one-woman drugstore, never without band-aids, floss, tampons or gum on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with a severe allergy also prematurely exposed me to some dark truths. The most heartbreaking lesson of childhood is that your parents can’t protect you from everything</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I learned this early on. Proactive and careful as they were, my parents couldn’t be there every time there was an incident. In fact, they were the accidental perpetrators of a few reactions. To chalk up my neuroses and distrust of adults to a nut allergy might seem, well, nuts, but it can’t be dismissed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s part of who I am, for better or worse. The disadvantages of a fatal allergy are obvious.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They read like the side effects delivered in hyperspeed at the end of a commercial: nausea, vomiting, swelling, redness, anaphylaxis, death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the upsides? I am long past the point of considering attention one of them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o amount of pity or compassion can counteract the trauma or resulting isolation. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the “everything happens for a reason” theory </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s disrespectful toward the victims of senseless tragedies and frankly, it’s bullshit. Some clouds are gray without a touch of silver. Some lemons are just meant to be lemons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite the drawbacks, having a severe allergy has gifted me with an alternative perspective on my own life. Along with all of the other timelines by which we organize our lives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationships, family pets, schools, career milestones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exists my personal history of reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details surrounding these incidents are forever vivid in my mind: the holiday decor at the Christmas Party where I ate white chocolate walnut fudge at age nine; the sunlight and rolling green hills at my second grade field trip, crumbs glinting off the knife that had been used to cut a peanut butter cookie moments before; the security of my mom’s hand around mine when she picked me up from kindergarten after a classmate’s birthday cake made me sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While allergic reactions make for unpleasant memories, they go hand in hand with special moments that I wouldn’t recall otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, one definitive benefit of having a deathly allergy: It gives people a way to show that they care about you. There’s a line in “Lady Bird” that goes, “Don’t you think they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” In this case, I think they are. Considering how nuts are exceedingly normal and harmless for about 95% of the population, a person needs a reason to care about their presence. I am that reason for my loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time someone takes extra precautions to ensure my safety, I feel like they’ve just handed me a present. Like when my friend Samantha insists on asking the waiter if the pizza we ordered has nuts, even though I’ve read the menu twice and pizza never has nuts, idiot. Or when my aunt Millie hands me the bowl of sweet potatoes that she personally prepares for me every Thanksgiving. It’s not just that my people look out for me; it’s that I never have to ask. They’ve already thought of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, living with this condition is perfectly manageable. Unlike many people, I’m fortunate to have a support system that includes access to medical treatment in case of an emergency. As of this moment, no cure has been found, though I’m sure it won’t be long now (and when it is, it’ll probably be </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-mylan-epipen-drug-prices-20180605-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outrageously expensive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was writing this, I got a text from Aunt Millie. “Can you eat sunflower seeds?” she wanted to know. “We’re going to make an appetizer for Passover with sunflower seeds in place of walnuts.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harper Lambert has never tasted Nutella, and she is not sad about it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.

No, they’re not religious. Yes, my sister is also white. No, I don’t even speak a word of the language. My parents are not my saviors. I am not their token Asian brainiac. We are your average family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, I am a Chinese immigrant. But my mother and father were born and raised in the suburbs of Illinois. My parents have never faced language barriers, filled out immigration forms or sacrificed the comforts and culture of their native country. My dad made salmon and asparagus for dinner, and my mom and I went out to eat at our favorite burrito dive. I was raised in a family that religiously watched the Super Bowl every year and ate Belgian waffles at the farmer’s market on Sundays. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve never had a close Asian friend. I grew up in a white family in a predominantly white community and attended a private high school. I was one of the only “yellow” faces on campus. I don’t speak a lick of Chinese and was enrolled in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course I didn’t go about my life purposefully avoiding Asian people and consciously isolating myself. There was no reason I didn’t have friends who identified as Asian. There was just no reason to pluck people out of my community who were Asian and force them to be my friend, to racially profile and try to force myself into a community in which I have never felt welcome or sought out to be included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to my former Chinese roommate, I am a “banana”: “yellow” on the outside, white on the inside. An Asian shell covering a mushy white interior. I was offended at first. Yes, the color analogy to define racial appearances is harmful, but there was a grain of truth in my “banana”-ness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A “banana.” This term is white-washed. An exclusionary and divisive ideology that dictates who’s Asian and who’s just, well, faking it. A “banana” wears Rainbow flip-flops and doesn’t speak the language of their home country. But why is the authenticity of Asian-ness questioned and compared? Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have denied my “banana” status for as long as I can remember. I ticked off the “Asian/Pacific Islander” box on every form and questionnaire. I was president of my high school’s Asian Student Union club. I attempted to learn Mandarin on Duolingo (I never passed Level 1). I played classical piano and proudly identified as a person of color.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my identity was thrown into question when I accompanied my friend to the UCSB Chinese New Year celebration in the Loma Pelona Center in February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red streamers draped from the ceiling and gold-lettered posters distracted from the usual recreational feel of the space. Circular tables were occupied by students and faculty I had never met or seen before. The fluorescent lights dimmed and my friend and I watched dance performances, songs and short clips of students in Chinese 5. The room vibrated with applause after each performance, friends cheering for their friends, performers giggling in embarrassment, supporting this display of what I finally realized was an authentic Chinese celebration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, the Chinese professor of the friend who brought me approached us with a warm smile, excited that my friend had included me. The professor looked at me and immediately began to speak in Chinese. My face fell flat. I was outed: the “banana” of the bunch. My mushy white interior was revealed from head to toe, from my scrunched, confused eyebrows to the Birkenstocks on my feet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food from Madame Lu, a restaurant downtown, was brought in and served buffet-style at the end of the room. My friend and I stood apart from the crowd, people-watching and eating when we saw my former roommate from last year, the “banana” accuser. I use the word “accuser” with the lightest and most satirical tone, as she is one of my favorite people on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having lived apart this year, it dawned on me that I missed our conversations about Chinese culture: me, humming the tune of songs that were in the performances and her, translating as best she could to find them on Spotify. Our conversations were mostly normal chit-chat, but I always walked away feeling like I gained a little piece of the lost culture I didn’t realize I had always yearned for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I left the LPC that night, chowing down on food whose names I couldn’t pronounce, I stopped being in denial and accepted my “banana”-ness. It wasn’t a derogatory term. It didn’t make me less of a person. I was an Asian-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These dual identities no longer existed in contradiction with one another; I was no longer in conflict with myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passing by Davidson Library, hearing the chatter of languages I can’t understand from the mouths of people who look like me but have life experiences and a security in their cultural identity that I will never know, I’ve begun to distance myself from the technicalities and physical appearance that superficially dictate my race.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the Asian communities and spaces on UCSB’s campus — KASA, the Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA), the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) and multicultural Asian sororities — the limit to which I belong to the Asian community is finally revealed to me. While we share a similar exterior, my “banana” identity sets me apart. Beyond the surface of every individual is a deeper and complex manifestation of quirks and strengths, flaws and contradictions.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These limits were important to accept. Difficult because of the years I spent in denial, but integral to my understanding of what Asian-American identity is. I used to measure my self-worth by how confident I felt identifying with each culture and was constantly concerned with simultaneously being authentically Asian </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> authentically American. I pulled apart these identities from the hyphen that bonds them but never felt that I had succeeded in wholly being either person. Assigning value to my Asian and American traits was a fool’s errand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling me a “banana” isn’t accurate enough. Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of my uncertainty was shame. It dictated my self-worth in toxic ways that kept me believing I had to choose one.

The idea is that someone with a growth mindset believes that their intelligence and skill can improve over time and with experience, while in contrast, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and skills are fixed traits that cannot change. These beliefs are underlying, but they nonetheless dictate a lot about how we learn — Dweck’s research has shown that people with growth mindsets find more success and satisfaction in learning than those with a fixed mindset. But while this concept mainly focuses on the way we learn, Dweck also suggests that our mindsets can have a huge impact on other aspects of our lives as well, whether that be academic, professional or personal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was learning about this research and the different kinds of mindsets, I began to recognize myself as a “fixed” thinker, but I also noticed that I wasn’t always like this. I remembered when I was younger and eager to pick myself up each time I fell down, and whether it was in the classroom or the studio, I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes. Somewhere between tutus and teendom, I lost my capability to bounce back from perceived failures. After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change. But the question remained: how? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fixed mindset made my first year of college very difficult. I found myself often discouraged and simply giving up academically. I took a math class in the winter of my freshman year, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to overcome the overwhelming thought that I wasn’t good at math and never could be. I let the homework pile up and the self-doubt devour me. Remember: One of the identifying characteristics of someone with a fixed mindset is the belief that their baseline intelligence can’t be changed, and I was a textbook example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of my first year, I was rapidly losing confidence in who I could be academically and artistically. It wasn’t until the next fall that I had my lightbulb moment. One morning I went to my dramatic writing professor’s office hours to tell her I was excited to write but I was worried that I sucked, and she said something along the lines of “everyone sucks until they don’t.” It took me a while to warm up to the idea, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it’s OK to suck; in fact, everyone sucks at some point, and especially at the beginning. In that class, I delved into the world of podcasts about writing and books on dramatic writing, and I discovered three fundamental truths: 1) first drafts always suck, 2) you will face a lot of rejection, 3) the only way to be a good writer is to write. Learning these things through the lens of writing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something I love and am </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sensitive about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made me realize that they apply to everything.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Divorce is not an easy concept for anyone to deal with, especially while in the midst of college. Everyone hopes for an ideal, happy family environment to come back to as well as having a sense of “home.” Nevertheless, for many students this hope just doesn’t mirror their reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if adjusting to my first year in college wasn’t daunting enough, I came to UCSB fresh out of my parents’ divorce. I still find that admitting I have divorced parents isn’t something that naturally comes out of my mouth when people ask me about my home life. To this day, it’s still strange to wrap my mind around the fact that I am no longer a student with happily married parents at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I am fortunate enough to say is that I was able to experience growing up with parents who were happily together. Of course, I, like any other kid with married parents, took this sense of comfort for granted. It’s almost impossible not to when society defines the family norm as a happily married couple with kids.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I personally never had to face the hardships involved with splitting time between two different households or deciding where to celebrate holidays when I was a kid. Both my sister and I were lucky enough to have had a completely secure upbringing with little worries or concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet there are so many people my age that did not have these same comforts growing up, and I recall being a kid in elementary school and thinking it was really sad that some of my friends’ parents weren’t together. I would watch them pack their school backpacks with miscellaneous overnight things in order to go from dad’s house in the morning to mom’s house after dance practice. What I failed to grasp at that age was how strong these other kids were becoming as they coped with a less comfortable or stable childhood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lillian Cheeks, a second-year student at UCSB, had to learn independence at a young age when her dad moved out of their house. While speaking about growing up with a single parent, she said, “I learned to be insanely self-sufficient and make decisions for myself at a young age because I had no other choice. At times I felt like I was partly raising myself because my mom had to work extra shifts, meaning I was alone most of the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, kids who grow up with married parents become reliant on their family for most everyday tasks and learn self-reliance later in life. Many other students, like Lillian, had to maneuver through childhood without a secure family bond and were pushed to grow up before they were ready. As difficult as this must have been on her childhood experience, Lillian still acknowledges that this experience shaped her into the capable student and person she is today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to college already very independent and knew how to make decisions for myself,” Lillian said. Being thrown into college and adjusting to life on your own is a scary process for most, but Lillian’s past made her more comfortable in adjusting to adult life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Silveria, another second-year student here at UCSB, also feels that the trauma of watching her parents’ divorce play out when she was a little girl helped shape her into the compassionate person she is today. She claims, “it has made me more tolerant and understanding with people and situations.” For this reason, she further expressed that even with all the hurt and pain she has experienced, she wouldn’t change the way things occurred even if she was given the option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some degree, I almost envy the people whose parents got divorced when they were young because it may have appeared completely normal when they were children. At a young age, there is a better chance of the child becoming accustomed to a new familial lifestyle and those adjustments can shape the individual into a strong, capable adult later in life.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 16,  my parents dropped a completely unexpected bomb: they were getting a divorce. I was old enough to realize that the family dynamic I had known thus far would forever change. My age </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along with the naivety I carried up until that point about happy families </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have made it even more difficult to cope with the divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Sydney Fishback, a third-year student at UCSB who was only 11 months old when her parents got divorced, discussed how she sympathizes with my experience. She expressed that it would have been much harder if she was older like I was when everything happened. “It would be harder because I would’ve been conditioned to seeing my parents together and used to knowing what it’s like to live with them both,” she noted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was perhaps one of the hardest things for me to adjust to. Today, I still struggle when people ask me if I’ll be going home for breaks. I have been forced to choose whether to visit my dad, who lives much closer now that he moved to SoCal last year, or to return to NorCal to my childhood home that I grew up in to see my mom. It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Complicated” is the best way to describe my life since my parents got divorced later in my life. Being in college and having to discover ways to see my parents, who live seven hours apart, has not been easy in the slightest. Whenever I become frustrated with my situation, it’s helpful to think about how lucky I was to have grown up with happy parents and that many other kids my age didn’t have this luxury. Although their marriage ended, I still have the memories that other people my age with divorced parents lack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether someone’s parents split up when they were a child or a teenager, there are bound to be both hardships and positives in each situation. It’s okay to have trouble with it at times. Whenever I need a breath, I take it.

The message behind having free condoms readily available is essentially a reminder to be safe, an acknowledgement that sex will probably take place so it’s best to be prepared for it. At the beginning of  fall quarter, I saw free condoms being put out, along with tampons and pads. I observed that contraceptives and feminine products were being categorized together, implying some degree of transferability regarding their necessity. This is something I disagree with. You cannot will your period to stop, as awesome as that would be, but (in a perfect world) you can choose whether or not you’d like to have sex.  My discomfort, of course, does not translate into support for any sort of regulation, policing or actions that should be taken. I look back now and see the right to participate freely and explore your sexual identity as something that years of sexual liberation, progress and technological innovation has brought to us. I do however, disagree with the conflation of what I see as cultural pressure to participate in casual sex with being liberated, progressive and “woke.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though feminism and the detachment of sex from traditional stigmas may appear to inevitably support casual sex, that does not mean it is necessarily emotionally healthy. According to a study published by the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/moniTor/2013/02/ce-corner\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on undergraduate students, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">78 percent of women and 72 percent of men who had uncommitted sex (including vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex) reported a history of experiencing regret following such an encounter.” This is all well and good because it’s the individual’s personal choice. But what if we zoom out and observe the cultural implications?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first exposure to the idea of casual sex was … an </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/25/552582404/hookup-culture-the-unspoken-rules-of-sex-on-college-campuses\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the distinctive characteristics of hookup culture.

From a young age, my perception of casual sex was colored by this study. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I saw college parties as a setting for these non-inclusive, hyperheterosexual, primal activities. Also, being in a long-term relationship and coming into this campus as a first-year, I observed the active party culture going on around me. Drawing from my preconceptions I felt skeptical and hesitant to embrace that culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to numbers, my caricatured idea of college life may be incorrect. From a </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40-year study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted between 1976 and 2016 on 18 million teenagers, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54% of high school students in 1991 reported having had sex, while only 41% did in the early 2010s.  This study even suggests that “today’s 18-year-old more closely resembles a 15-year-old of the 1970s or ’80s.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So even though it may feel like everyone around me is “doing the deed” 24/7, we are actually participating in less sex than older generations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the reasoning behind this? Perhaps there are more romantics among us today who feel as I do and are more likely to give it some time. Or maybe people are generally less interested in dating earlier on. Or it may be that the definition of sex and intimacy has changed. It ultimately boils down to several factors, the center of it all being technology.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has changed the game.

With so much to do on social media and streaming services, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more people prefer to stay in and use devices </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">instead of, say, go out to do drugs, drink alcohol and find partners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though statistics support this view of people our age, our campus appears to oppose the general data about Gen Z’s sexual habits. Could the reputation of UCSB’s social life create a concentration of people more interested in sex, alcohol and drugs, thereby exempting this population from a generalized claim? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be an interesting thing to think about, but in the end it should not affect the way you go about your life. I may have had my preconceived notions about casual sex and even taken a moral stance on it back then, but the fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.

They can be old friends that you’ve had since you were young but have always stayed around, the new friends that you just met in September or those people in the middle that are somehow just always </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although difficult to recognize at times, these kinds of friends can often be some of the most toxic people in our lives. Whether it is needing to constantly reassure them of your friendship, or acting like their therapist rather than a friend, at some point many of us come to ask ourselves, “Is this friendship worth maintaining?”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87695\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87695\" data-attachment-id=\"87695\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/image1-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=650%2C764&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,764\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=213%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=650%2C764&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87695\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?resize=457%2C538\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"538\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87695\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As college students, we meet new people every day.

This is not high school, people. We don’t have classes with the same people five days a week, we do not have the same dependence on finding a group of people to eat lunch with and, thank god, we are not stuck in the same place for seven hours of our day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we have freedom. And not only does this mean being able to choose where we eat lunch and what classes we take, but it also means choosing who we spend our time with. This means that friendships are not obligatory, and we can find people who truly make us feel happy and fulfilled.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students need to become better at self-care in terms of determining which friendships are actually healthy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am not saying that this task is easy. In the complicated social life of college, your friends are usually connected to your other friends to create a complex web of people you know, but do not always like. So, trying to get rid of a toxic friend that sits within a group of people you generally like is almost impossible. And I am not saying that I have all the solutions to these types of awkward situations; what I am saying is that it is important to recognize people in your life that repeatedly annoy and drain you. This doesn’t mean they are inherently horrible people — you just don’t want them in your house constantly, eating your beloved Ben &amp; Jerry’s The Tonight Dough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have had a series of epiphanies this quarter especially. I have reached the end of the honeymoon phase where everyone is nice, funny and a great friend. Some people are just friends more so out of obligation or for convenience, as we just don’t click with everybody. The same goes for friends in high school as well. At UCSB, I have learned what I want in my friends and the people I surround myself with. In high school, friends were more handed to us through similar activities and classes, but here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between loving your friends for their faults and tolerating a toxic friendship because we are too nice or too lazy to express our feelings. Loving your friends for who they are should not translate to making you feel degraded or hurt constantly, but rather means appreciating the diversity amongst friends. This does not mean we should berid anyone that seems slightly irritating, as some of my best friends are individuals who I did not originally click with. However, that only means that active communication is even more important, so both friends understand each other and their wishes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, it can be easier to recognize these qualities within romantic partners. Of course, this does not always mean that a break-up is clean, as sometimes even the most disgusting of partners tend to stick around, whether we like it or not. However, just like how our friends would tell us to break up with a person who is treating us poorly, I am also saying that this break-up, although messy and stressful, can also happen with friends, whether we’ve known them for 10 years or 10 months. At the same time, it is also important to understand that people are capable of change, and sometimes communicating your feelings is the most important step toward mending a broken friendship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking care of others can often be easier than taking care of ourselves. We make excuses for them and tell ourselves that they aren’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bad, that they’ll get better, but then five years later, they’re still eating The Tonight Dough out of your fridge while you glare at them from across the living room. But, as adults now trying to navigate through the complex social scene of UCSB, it is important for us to prioritize our own lives and search for meaningful friendships that make us feel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happy.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We do not have to put up with people who make us feel like shit or people who never put in any effort. We are adults, and it’s time we start having friendships with people who are adult enough to be good friends too. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley is a first year who emphasizes the importance of finding and maintaining genuine friendships within the complex social scene of college. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Can fairies and students don’t really mix: maybe you nod or flash a tight-lipped smile as you bike to class or walk downtown for a bite to eat, or exchange bilingual pleasantries as you stoop under the beer die table to help them collect the day’s haul of empties. However, chances are that’s the extent of most interactions many of us have had with can fairies.

They would clamor over the crinkling, clinking, crashing mountain of salvaged bottles and cans that occasionally spilled out the back of the van and onto the road. At the time their noisy repose signified nothing; it was just a softer accompaniment to the sounds of trap and laughter, wafting over the tops of eucalyptus trees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d like to think of myself as a fairly empathetic and giving person:  If I saw a friend in need, I’d gladly provide whatever help I could. But I didn’t offer any help to the couple in the van — I didn’t even think twice about it. Ignoring their ongoing struggle with extreme poverty right outside my door, while simultaneously maintaining the lifestyle of an affluent college student, is a sort of paradox, and it would have been crippling to see it for what it was and do nothing. Mental gymnastics makes ignoring your neighbor’s suffering much easier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologists call this paradox cognitive dissonance: the implacable discomfort that occurs whenever our thoughts, opinions or actions don’t fall in line with our values. To relieve ourselves of this dissonance, we must change. We commonly alter either our thoughts or actions to fit with our ideals or vice versa. But, there is another way to rid ourselves of dissonance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Leon Festinger — the psychologist who </span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24936719.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first described</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cognitive dissonance — puts it, to reduce cognitive dissonance “a person… can even distort his perception and his information about the world around him.” If we aren’t seeing things for what they are, then we can still keep our morals intact and go on, business as usual. This distortion is the gymnast’s specialty, and morals are his medium. I can see now that, with the help of my gymnast, I was carefully avoiding my neighbors and their struggles. My gymnast and I twisted, flipped and spun around moral obstacles, performing contortions that from a different perspective could appear improbable or astounding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My gymnast helped me look at  my neighbors without seeing them. We interacted fairly regularly. Most mornings I would shuffle around the back of my house to my bike, still sore from lack of sleep the night before and come face to face with the man rifling through my garbage cans, bag in hand. I’d smile and say hello. He’d flash a nervous greeting from under the brim of his sunhat and that would be that. I never made an effort to get to know him </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fter a year of living so close to each other, I never learned his name. To me he was just another can fairy. A part of the backdrop that is life in I.V.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It begins with a conversation, a real one, with the next person who slips into our backyards to collect our empyies or check your bins for misfiled bottles.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m tired of living with my moral gymnast. I’m tired of avoiding eye contact with people I know deep down could really use someone’s acknowledgement. I’m tired of pretending like I don’t know most can fairies likely make around $40 a day, working sunrise to sunset. I’m tired of not knowing my neighbors’ names and I’m tired of feeling guilty and still doing nothing to change that. It’s too late for me to get to know my old neighbors. I’ve gone back to my old street and looked for them, but their van is gone. Maybe they found a more hospitable place to stay — I certainly hope so. And I hope my struggle to get my gymnast out of my head is a personal one, but I’ve seen too many other people in I.V. vault up and get themselves out of the way of seeing their neighbors to believe that’s the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it’s not all doom and gloom. We Isla Vistans are uniquely poised to evict our moral gymnasts once and for all. I.V. is now a sort of Neverland, toeing the line between reality and myth. We live (to paraphrase Lewis Hyde) in a place halfway between a slum and a library — an island of endless shabby apartments where throngs of shoeless idealists are free to let their imaginations run wild. Isla Vista rests on a lengthy volume of history, much of it fairly unpleasant. From wetland to parking lot, Chumash land to bean farm, open pit mine to proving ground for environmental and social activists — we live in a place that has seen a lot of suffering over the decades and centuries. Yet, it is this history that gives us an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of previous residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our gymnast-aided denial of the existence of can fairies represents a chance to bring the myth of Isla Vista closer to its reality. It begins with a conversation, a real one, with the next person who slips into our backyards to collect our empyies or check your bins for misfiled bottles. What we do to reduce dissonance is ultimately a conscious choice: we can continue to distort, obscure, and contort our perception to avoid facing uncomfortable facts, or we can brush up on those two years of high school Spanish quickly fading from memory and change our actions instead.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Lenihan believes fairies are real.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/","id":5631,"author":{"id":817,"name":"Thomas Lenihan"},"related":[5630,5629,5628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Getting A’s and Taking L’s","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=650%2C464&ssl=1","description":"Joshen Mantai examines how academic pressure has negatively impacted her mental health in college.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know when I first realized I had academic anxiety. I remember in middle school breezing through Algebra I and geometry while most others had trouble. After every test was handed back in math, the first reaction from my friend would be, “What’d you make? I bet you got a 100.” The teacher would hand me the test back, my face would turn beat red and my heart would feel like it was about to explode out of my chest. Was it because I was afraid of personal disappointment, or was it because I was wary of not living up to my friend’s expectations?

Coping with academic anxiety is a struggle that I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s something I didn’t see the direct effects of when I was younger, but it gradually built up over time. At a young age, I was placed into the category of “academic talent.” My defining personality trait was decided for me before I could figure it out for myself: she’s the “smart one.” I remember being placed into the gifted student program in elementary school and being confused at what exactly it meant to be academically gifted. It didn’t help that my parents are engineers and that I’m half Indian — two facets which people attributed to my academic success as genetic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87691\" style=\"width: 554px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87691\" data-attachment-id=\"87691\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-24/getting-as-and-taking-ls/academic-anxiety/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=650%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Academic anxiety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87691\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=544%2C388\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"388\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety is not something I’ve ever talked about with anyone or an aspect that anyone in my life has really noticed.

I realized how stupid it was later that I cried over a B, but the anxiety associated with earning a B didn’t go away, just the initial extreme reaction.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/02/03/stress-and-isolation-blamed-for-string-of-suicides-at-columbia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suicide rates at colleges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — especially Ivy League campuses from increasing academic pressure and schoolwork-related stress — indicates the pervasiveness of academic anxiety. These kids are portrayed as students who never left their dorm room or couldn’t cope with the pressure of going to such a competitive school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I feel academically challenged at UCSB, but the pressure of going to an Ivy League would be insurmountable for me. Being surrounded by geniuses and trying to define success for myself in that environment would cause me to reach a mental breaking point. I’ve heard stories about some Ivy League schools where if a student leaves their notes on a desk unattended, other students will trash them in an attempt to eliminate some competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s not just Ivy League schools. I’ve seen my friends’ Snapchat stories where they’re stressed and staying up until 3 a.m. to finish that 30-page paper and got maybe four hours of sleep before their next class. And that’s when I realized that college isn’t just a struggle for me but an cumbersome fight for all of us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. A 10-week course with a few major assignments making up the bulk of your grade is not exactly a framework that is conducive for students to succeed. We’re encouraged to take 15-17 units a quarter, which is a lot to juggle with sports, jobs, clubs and maintaining a social life. I didn’t realize the extremity of this until the end of Winter Quarter.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pride in getting A’s was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter Quarter was a wake-up call for me. It was rainy, I was taking 17 units and it was the perfect condition for me to slack off. I have never felt as much anxiety as I did when I was sick during finals week. I felt as though I couldn’t breathe every time I finished one of my four finals — not just because my nasal passages were blocked, but also because I did the bare minimum to get by that quarter up until then. The intensity of cramming information into my brain was too much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I did get A’s in my classes Winter Quarter, I didn’t feel satisfied. Why? Because the expectation of succeeding was no longer external, it was something ingrained in me. The pride in getting As was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. I convinced myself if I didn’t get an A in one of my classes, I would be a colossal failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Winter Quarter ended up being a wake-up call for my mental health. I know it isn’t reasonable to place these burdensome expectations on myself, but I still don’t know how to alleviate my academic anxiety; I don’t think any of us do. But I do know one thing: Academic success does not define us as students. We all have learning curves. While one of us may have an aptitude for calculus, someone else may have a knack for literature. We as a generation have a naive but admirable tendency to want to achieve greatness and make something of ourselves no matter the cost. After all, that’s what our parents did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But however you define success, you should never put it before your mental health. The anxiety caused by the desire to succeed is probably not going to be absent in our kids and future generations, but we should convince them that it’s more important to prioritize mental health than the anxiety of the burdens we’re facing. It’s not something we can just convince ourselves of, but something we have to instill in each other. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants you to prioritize your mental health and talk about your anxiety with someone else.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

I was just settling into this environment and was finally starting to make friends, but it would all be for nothing if I gave all that up and moved to Melbourne for a semester. I could trade daygers for nights at a classy bar, but there is only so little time I have to be young in I.V. before I graduate and become a “real adult.” Bars and good people are everywhere but staying in I.V. isn’t forever. Someday I will have to move to a big city to eventually find a job or two that can keep me alive, but not just yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who’ve come back from studying abroad say it was the greatest experience of their lives, but most people who go abroad have the rest of their college careers to make up for lost time, while I’ll be missing an entire Fall Quarter and summer of my second and last year here due to being a transfer student. Spring Quarter is already here and before I know it I’ll be graduating with at least a few regrets on my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had some of my earliest thoughts about wanting to travel while sitting on the carpet of my grandparents’ house looking at souvenirs from places all around the world, from South Africa to China and from Italy to Ireland. I would look at postcards of the Coliseum in Rome and dream of going there and exploring the city. I eventually made my way there on a June evening in 2014. The sunset looked exactly how it did on the postcard, and I felt better than I expected to feel because I reached a goal of mine that I never thought I would complete. Whenever I used to think of foreign countries, I would imagine them being completely different than what I’m used to here in America, but walking past the parks in Rome reminded me of sitting under the shaded trees on a hot day in Sacramento as a child, and for a second I was able to comprehend what it was like to feel like I had two homes at once. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear of being lonely abroad still scares me, and it comes from a place of being lonely at UCSB myself. My entire Winter Quarter was one disappointment after the other, and it culminated in me applying to study abroad in order to mitigate those fears of being friendless for another year. What I thought was an escape route from my fears ended up opening more than a few other cans of worms. Proactive homesickness was already starting to take effect for me and almost pushed me to withdraw from my program. I stuck through, however, and listened to the stories of people who came back, knowing that regret is stronger for those who don’t do what they yearn to do. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear of being lonely abroad still scares me, and it comes from a place of being lonely at UCSB myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s also holding me back right now is the cost, and I probably made the worst decision in choosing one of the </span><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/numbeo-finds-sydney-king-of-the-costs-compared-to-melbourne-and-growing-20180117-h0jtvj.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most expensive cities in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Melbourne, Australia — all in the name of being comfortable with speaking my native language and an easy academic and cultural adjustment. What would I have had to gain if I just went to another place so similar to my home country? Would I waste thousands of dollars doing the same tasks like studying and partying in a place that I could always go back to?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t trust myself to keep my word and move abroad by myself on my own terms right after graduation because of how indecisive I am, so why not do it now when people are encouraging me to go? When I go abroad, I’ll still have the comforts of UCSB to look forward to when I come back for Winter Quarter, as well as the support of the EAP program and advisors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I’m going abroad to Australia this fall, even if it scares me. I promised myself I would go to another country during college, and this is probably my only chance to take that step.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up in the Japanese-American community, there were some activities that were simply commonplace. Before picking up our chopsticks, my father and I would always place our palms together and say </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itadakimasu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to express thanks for the savory bowl of somen noodles on our table. After dinner, I’d mount my plastic stool, meet my 5’2” mother at eye level and roll tiny onigiri balls at her side for my school lunch the next day. At my after school program, Nihonmachi Little Friends, we would procrastinate on our homework by debating who had the fanciest three-layer pencil case or the rarest type of Iwako take-apart eraser. After homework time, the musically talented would go to taiko practice, and the athletes to karate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the sun began to set, our senseis would try to calm our undying energy by reading us a story such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momotarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Peach Boy”) or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urishima Tarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Fisher Lad”). After this failed, they would scatter square-shaped papers of various colors and prints over the short-legged craft tables and we students would gather around in stout plastic chairs to fold origami. Within minutes, sparkly purple fish would swim across the table, green polka-dotted butterflies would flutter through the air and orange jumping frogs would hop all over the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folding origami was my favorite activity, simply because it was fun. It was a way for me to make new decorations for my bedroom. It gave me the means to create tiny boxes perfect for holding the rocks, beads and other priceless treasures I collected from the playground floor. Best of all, it gave me an excuse to make ninja stars that I could chuck at my friends without consequence.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Sadako was two years old and living near Hiroshima when the United States dropped its first atomic bomb on the city during World War II. Due to radiation exposure, she fell ill with leukemia in adolescence and began to grow terribly weak. Her distraught father uncovered a Japanese legend that promises anyone who folds </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(one thousand paper cranes) a wish granted by the gods. Sadako’s friends and family gathered as a community to fold the cranes in order to grant their loved one the wish of a return to health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspired by the girls in the story whose ages were near my own, I decided to take a break from the mischievous ninja stars and put my origami skills to the test by folding cranes. At first I had little luck. My first bird bore an enormous beak and resembled a pelican, mouth full of fish. My second bird came out lopsided as if it had fallen from its nest in infancy and broken its wing. I nevertheless kept folding, and, with time, perfected the crisp lines and sharp edges of a perfect origami crane. From then on, cranes remained my origami of choice</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout middle and high school, I used crane-folding as a way to pass time, to upcycle paper that would otherwise be discarded or to calm my mind when I became caught up in boy drama. I folded hundreds of cranes as did Sadako, but for me, it was always just a fun pastime. I never imagined myself in such a situation calling for a serious role of origami.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the summer of 2014, I received terrible news. My mother’s best friend, Beckie, who since my birth had been like a second mother to me, had been in a traumatic bicycle accident. On a sunny weekend ride, she had fallen to the ground and hit her head. The specialists placed her in a medically induced coma, leaving her entirely unconscious for weeks. This woman was my role model, a female, Japanese-American icon, who had devoted her life to helping other women of color less privileged than she was. I felt lost and helpless. As friends and family rallied to raise funds to pay her outrageous hospital bills, I wallowed with frustration in my helplessness. After all, I was only 16 years old with no money to give, no driver’s license to help with transportation, nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night as I lay awake worrying about the future of Beckie’s condition, I decided to fold some origami to stop my mind from circling. I anxiously ripped my old geometry syllabus into a square and began to fold. As I tucked the sides of the paper into its deep pleats, I began to question why I was folding paper at two in the morning. My mind wandered back to the sailing ninja stars and jumping frogs at Nihonmachi, until it stopped at the story of Sadako Sasaki, the girl who folded 1,000 cranes. Dazed and exhausted, inspired yet afraid, I asked myself, “Could cranes like these be used to heal Beckie?” I stared at the tiny paper mass in the palm of my clammy hand, then quickly tossed it aside. It was a senseless idea; even with the help of my mother and a few dedicated friends, there was no way we would be able to fold the 1,000 cranes needed to grant Beckie the wish of revival. I turned over in bed, forced my eyes shut and urged sleep to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning at breakfast, my mother notified me that Beckie’s brain had begun to swell. At risk of oxygen deprivation due to intracranial pressure, she would be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergoing a fluid drainage procedure to help alleviate this pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stunned by the news, I blurted out the 1,000 crane idea I had shot down the night prior, then crumpled with embarrassment at my impulsive absurdity. To my surprise, my mom praised my idea and encouraged me to move forward with it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87576\" style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87576\" data-attachment-id=\"87576\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/nexuspapercranes-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=650%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,338\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"nexuspapercranes copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=888%2C462&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87576\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?resize=579%2C301\" alt=\"\" width=\"579\" height=\"301\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That week, I collected the emails of around 100 of Beckie’s friends, family members, ex-classmates and colleagues. I typed out a message with a short description of the 1,000 cranes legend and a simple explanation of how to fold them. The email was set and ready to go, yet I still questioned my endeavor: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will these people even see the value in origami? They all have busy schedules. Why would they take time out of their day to learn how to fold paper? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought of failure and the humiliation of being the 16 year old girl who thought she could persuade individuals whom she had never met to join her in a paper folding project. Dwelling in apprehension, my mind flashed to the thought of Beckie’s upcoming procedure. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What strength it must take to undergo an operation like that.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If Beckie, my role model, could undergo a brain operation, I should be able to send an email. With the click of a paper airplane, I sent my hopes flying to inboxes all over the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the month, I found my mailbox stuffed daily with origami cranes on papers of assorted colors and patterns sent from Beckie’s loved ones in states I had never before visited; Minnesotans and New Yorkers</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alike were eager to contribute. Multiple packages from the East Coast came with letters expressing gratitude for the project. These individuals felt that cranes enabled them to connect to Beckie despite the fact that they lived thousands of miles away. They had been looking for a way to support, and this project gave them just that. Empowered by the community’s devotion, my mom and I quickly got to work stringing the little birds into strands of 40.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two months of unpacking overstuffed envelopes, sorting the origami by color and carefully running our needles through the birds’ delicate backs, we reached 25 strands. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was complete. Born from the hands of individuals living thousands of miles apart, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 paper cranes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> swayed together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a warm September Saturday afternoon, my mom and I hopped in our silver Prius to deliver the multicolored flock to Beckie. By this time, her recovery had progressed and she was back living at her home in the East Bay. When we pulled into her steep driveway, I felt my heart beating so loudly I wondered if my mom could hear it. I couldn’t decide if it was out of nervousness or excitement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probably a bit of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beckie greeted us at her front door. She looked different. Her hair was short as it had been shaved for her procedures. She looked tired. She walked slowly, taking each step with care. Although no longer hospitalized, she still had a long road to recovery. Yet, despite all the progress to be made, she bore the same kind-eyed smile that has never ceased to shine for as long as I’ve known her. When we revealed the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Beckie, she accepted it with reverence, calling it a “life-saving gift.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87572\" style=\"width: 518px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87572\" data-attachment-id=\"87572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/cranemail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=2048%2C1275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cranemail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=508%2C316\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, four and a half years later, Beckie has fully recovered from her brain trauma. She hikes on the weekends, cooks delicious </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chawanmushi </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(savory egg custard) and continues her work in social justice. One thousand cranes hang in her living room, a reminder of hope and healing, compassion and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these tiny paper birds give the gift of life, their sheer existence depends on generations passing down the knowledge of their creation. Hence, they serve as reminders of the Japanese cultural history, passed down through generations. They serve as agents of hope for the future yet to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, I felt young, useless and incapable of making a difference. I doubted my worth as a meager 16 year old with nothing but empty pockets and a passion for folding paper. But after seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s often assumed that donating money is the most effective way of supporting a cause. Political candidates solicit monetary contributions to fund their campaigns, nonprofits asks for donations to enable their efforts, crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe set clear-cut financial goals that can only be met with money. Those lacking financial means unfortunately fall outside the scope of individuals deemed capable of enacting change. Yet, these penniless souls may possess creative and alternative talents, which hold a transformative potential of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to imply that people should not give money to the causes they endorse. After all, Beckie’s recovery would not have been possible had she not been able to pay her hospital bills. However, this is to say that money is not everything. If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages others to rethink their change-making capability.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.
