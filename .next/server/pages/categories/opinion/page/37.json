More than 10 years since the initial attack on the twin towers, I watched President Obama’s address to the nation confirming bin Laden’s death as my body was emotionally overwhelmed with shock, pride for my nation and a feeling that justice had been served. His death has avenged the roughly 3,000 that perished in the assault on our country and provided some closure to the families that suffered a loss and a city who felt vulnerable after the tragedies of 9/11.</p>\n<p>However, after the initial elation had withdrawn from my body, I was left with emptiness and harsh reality of the situation. Eliminating the leader of al-Qaeda has not and will not defeat the deep-rooted and extensive network of al-Qaeda. I believe the deceased leader will only be glorified as a martyr and will serve as a catalyst for more violence and attacks from the extremists who followed him. I think of it much like a starfish: You can sever every appendage, but it will always regenerate. America’s efforts to track and kill bin Laden have proved to be more of a trophy for bragging rights than a productive step toward eliminating terrorism. At the least, America has displayed to the world something that has been proven countless times before: Our nation holds an aggressive foreign policy with a very superior, efficient and violent military machine to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p>The only concluding thoughts I have pulled from bin Laden’s assassination is that our nation and leaders have been fooled into thinking we as a country can erase terrorism from the world. By the mouths of officials and the talking heads in media, terror has been put into a neatly packaged and nicely labeled entity called al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, terror is far beyond an organization of extremists and its essence transcends the realm of tangibility. Rather, it is an idea and a philosophy which will be used forever by those who sense a polarity in ideals, culture and religion. As long as homogeneity exists within the world, there will be conflict and thus terrorism.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/","id":6200,"author":{"id":566,"name":"Cameron Jones"},"related":[6199,6198,6197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chalk Slogans Create Straw Man","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I call attention to the various chalk protests we see on our campus walkways.

Some decry an unjust imbalance between defense spending and spending on education. These chalk slogans are classic examples of the logical fallacy, the “straw man.” In a classic straw man fallacy, attention is drawn away from the real issue by a dramatic rhetorical distraction. In this case, the authors of these claims are misleading their readers by diverting attention from real spending numbers.</p>\n<p>The budget figures in the chalk displays are claimed to be about 85 on defense and 5 percent on education. Sometimes (on the more honest displays) it indicates that these are percentages of federal “discretionary spending.” Mandatory federal payments include pensions, Medicare, welfare and state and local transfers. These make up more than half of federal government spending. Discretionary spending, including defense, highways and education, make up the rest.</p>\n<p>In the United States, almost all education spending is done at the state and local level. If one counts state and local spending on educational programs, as one must, then we find education spending is in fact higher than defense spending. For example, during the height of the war in Iraq in 2006, the total spending on education in the United States was $788 billion, while $622 billion was spent on defense. In terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), that is about 6 percent GDP on education and 5 percent on defense.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is the University of California suffering from a funding crisis?

What we need is a way to “go green” without consequently going broke. One student group has taken care to notice our growing concern and now labors in our stead to get us what we want.<br>\nFamiliarize yourself with them now. The conscientious members of the Student Food Collective, an Office of Student Life group, dedicate themselves to providing us with healthy, ecologically sustainable and ethically sound food while at the same time reducing our environmental impact and supporting our local agricultural economy. They place as equal an emphasis on educating about sustainable practices as they do in implementing them.<br>\nTheir current brainchild is called the “I.V. Food for Thought” project. Through close work and collaboration with Associated Students, SFC plans to provide us with two new excellent places where we can get our nutritious and affordable grub on. The first is a trendy mobile food cart substantially unlike the ones currently sprinkled about campus. SFC’s cart boasts a technologically superior design, powered via solar panel installations. Not only would it be a sick aesthetic addition to behold on our campus, but also a point of pride in the capability of student initiative and mindfulness. The second place is even more tantalizing. SFC plans to re-purpose the restaurant space at 6521 Pardall Rd. — across from Chino’s — into a lively sit-down café. Think of it as Natural Café meets Backyard Bowls and the Daily Grind. They envision it as a chill place to eat, hang and study while also serving as a venue for live music, group events and film screenings. The café’s menu will feature great tasting food that also emphasizes the importance of locally and ethically sourced ingredients. They expect the average meal to be modestly priced around seven dollars. Additionally, they plan to nourish an organic raised bed garden to use as a food source and as an educational workshop space.<br>\nAgain, SFC is in the business of serving us. What grows out of the “I.V. Food for Thought” project does not aim to seek profit. In collaboration with A.S., their goal is to provide a service to UCSB students akin to the A.S. Bike Shop. Student needs provided by student funds. Our Legislative Council has already collected $250,000 in favor of bringing SFC’s project to fruition.<br>\nFor around the last four years, A.S. has seriously entertained a student-run restaurant service on campus as an alternative to current options. It was natural, then, that they sought the guidance and advice this past Winter Quarter of the Student Food Collective. SFC’s robust vision for healthy and affordable sustainable food sources on campus meshed well with A.S.’s idea of a student run venture. Together, they are now engaging in early contractual stages of a five year lease at the Pardall locale. The bulk of potential Spring 2011 funds will be used for amenities typically associated with a restaurant start up, such as pragmatic and stylistic renovations, lighting, educational materials, furniture, inventory and staff wages.<br>\nWhy should we be excited about this? Why is the arrival of these services worthy of our anticipation? First of all, SFC’s is a rather novel endeavor. Through their efforts, we can come to represent a university whose students seek to boldly empower themselves, taking sensible initiative and control over what we eat and how it impacts us, our community and our environment. Furthermore, SFC’s proclaimed mission stands as one we back wholeheartedly: to foster a coalition of like-minded individuals and organizations co-creating, living, learning and nourishing spaces that embody sustainable practices in all aspects.<br>\nLooking toward our future, the viability of our current environmental practices appears grim. But, we, the most revolutionary generation in human history, can put the world on our backs. The efforts of SFC in collaboration with A.S. aim to “fire the first shots” of environmental sensibility. I, for one, am standing behind them.

If you don’t know where that is, I won’t hold it against you. Being a caseworker in the PR Dept. of the OSA, most of my time is spent taking cases or meeting with students who feel unfairly treated by the university. Though our services are confidential, most involve drinking violations in the dorms or plagiarism allegations in the classroom. However, the office door is usually open for walk-ins.</p>\n<p>A.S. Main is a peculiar place; a wide variety of student groups and elected officials meet there everyday, and as such, I often have the chance to chat with most of them about current events. Elections having just been completed and the candidates chosen (congratulations and good luck guys, you’re going to need it); the major discussions taking place involve next year’s administration. Unfortunately, not all of this talk has been positive.</p>\n<p>In fact, it is extremely disheartening to have heard personal attacks on individual people. Even worse, not all of these comments occur in the office, where at least most people have the courtesy to abide by the slightly ridiculous slogan that “A.S. is a place for everyone.” Instead, they resort to more public places like Facebook to vent their qualms regarding election results. I realize that many of you reading this may not really care about what goes on in A.S. (sadly, only about half of all undergraduates voted), but no matter who you are, you should certainly care that these people regulate over $9 million of your money.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nine million dollars.

There are far more productive uses of our time. The elected officials have an enormous amount of work to do considering our current economic climate. Further, they were chosen by you not because of their political party, but because they campaigned tirelessly, ran a legitimate platform and set themselves apart with their own personal qualifications and experience.</p>\n<p>I’m not affiliated with any campus political party, and I couldn’t really care less about them because I voted based on who had the right experience for the job. However, there are those who feel that based on election results, A.S. is “doomed” next year. If this is you, I implore you to realize just how many opportunities there are on this campus to get involved and make the changes you want to see happen instead of irrationally ranting to your 700 Facebook friends via an ill-thought-out status update.</p>\n<p>Office of the Student Advocate constitutes a prime example of how to make a difference. You now have a fresh start to get involved in the office either as a caseworker or by working with our budding Restorative Justice campaign, which will hopefully be instituted as a part of the regular university judicial process by this time next year.  If you are one of the people who was upset by the way A.S. was run this past year or the way the recent elections turned out, then you have no excuse but to become involved. I’m not an A.S. expert by any means, but I do know several new execs and reps closely, and all of them want to know what you have to say.</p>\n<p>As a graduating senior, I can honestly tell you that working with the OSA was one of the most rewarding experiences of my four years here. The fact that I will leave a legacy in the office, albeit a very small one, means a tremendous amount to me and the experience I’ve gained working there is invaluable.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in the free services OSA provides for students or want to submit an application to work with us, please feel free to stop by our office in the MCC, next to the UCen, on Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Chase Fiedler is head of the Public Relations Office of the Student Advocate and proud of it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/passive-aggression-facebook-stagnates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/passive-aggression-facebook-stagnates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/passive-aggression-facebook-stagnates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/passive-aggression-facebook-stagnates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/passive-aggression-facebook-stagnates/","id":6195,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6194,6193,6192],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Negligent Government Spending Prohibits Prosperity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Recently Standard & Poor’s issued a warning that the U.S. debt rating could be downgraded due to excessive spending, debt and deficits.

The investment community is questioning our government’s ability to maintain sound fiscal and monetary policy and is warning that our long-term rating will be reduced. How has it come to this?</p>\n<p>In 2008, our gross public debt over 230-plus years was about $10 trillion. Over the next three years, our country will amass a new debt of about $4.5 trillion.  World War II cost our country about $4 trillion in 2009 dollars. Our gross national debt is now approaching our gross domestic product which signals a historical turning point of economic and social decline.</p>\n<p>The present generation borrows about 40 cents of every dollar spent by the government from its children, and our Federal Reserve has been purchasing over 70 percent of our newly issued bonds with newly printed dollars. The resulting inflation that results from this expansion of the money supply will dramatically reduce the value of savings for the young, poor and aged.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It’s now clear that we cannot continue spending money that we don’t have and printing money to buy (“monetize”) our own debt. We are on the fast track to a very predictable fiscal trainwreck if we do not make significant changes in our budget, and soon.</p>\n<p>We have a chronic spending problem. We simply can’t afford the government we have, and it will destroy our society if we remain on this present course. Worst of all, young people — college students who are the next generation — will bear the brunt of our government’s irresponsible spending.</p>\n<p>It’s their future earnings we are spending today, and it is simply immoral.</p>\n<p>But it gets worse — our government has made promises that cannot be kept. Between Medicare,  Medicaid and Social Security, our country faces about $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. There is zero chance those commitments can be met, and most people intuitively know this. Almost nobody under the age of 50 believes they will get Social Security or Medicare in its current form.</p>\n<p>The recently passed House budget framework attempts to address the issue for Medicare and Medicaid, the most problematic programs. But Democrats have responded with the predictable “throw grandma under the bus” charges.  Don’t buy into it: In Paul Ryan’s budget plan, people in the system now and 55 or older will face no changes to their entitlements.</p>\n<p>The reality is our entitlement programs are guaranteed to fail if we continue on our current path. The proposed budget tries to save Medicare, not destroy it.  If our politicians continue to demagogue the issue, scare seniors and kick the proverbial can down the road, the fixes will be far more drastic and much more painful. But they will come.</p>\n<p>Allow me to dispel another myth that is impeding our escape from the fiscal abyss: This problem cannot be solved on the back of the “rich.” The President’s solution is to raise taxes on couples making over $250 thousand a year, and make them pay their “fair” share. The reality is that the U.S. already has one of the most progressive tax systems on the planet.</p>\n<p>According to 2008 IRS data, the top 2 percent ($250 thousand and over) of taxpayers pay roughly 50 percent of all income taxes while earning 25 percent of U.S. income. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay zero income tax.</p>\n<p>The government could tax all income over $250 thousand at 100 percent and it still would not close this year’s deficit — in fact, it would destroy our economy in the process. Regardless of top marginal tax rates, we have historically captured about 19 percent of GDP in tax revenues while we are currently spending about 25 percent of GDP.</p>\n<p>More importantly, how does taking money out of the private economy through higher taxes help that private economy grow? It won’t. Spending is the primary impediment to economic recovery that we face today.</p>\n<p>The House budget isn’t perfect, but it is a good start towards dealing with our chronic deficits and long-term fiscal health; at least it has a template for balancing the budget. The President’s budget doesn’t come close.</p>\n<p>It is time to get serious about spending. Investors will not continue to fund our debt if they think we will just devalue their bonds by printing money. We simply cannot tax, spend, borrow and print our way to prosperity: Either we enforce our own spending discipline or the bond markets will enforce it for us, as the warning shot from S&amp;P demonstrated.</p>\n<p>One way or another, the spending party is over. Young Americans should be jumping for joy — you’ll be much better off.</p>\n<p>Tom Watson is a local entrepreneur and former Congressional candidate for the 23rd district.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/","id":6198,"author":{"id":565,"name":"Tom Watson"},"related":[6197,6196,6195],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bag Ban Would Break Corporate Inertia and Beach Pollution","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the past three years, the nonprofits Save the Mermaids, Surfrider, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper and LoaTree have been working to bring the issue of single-use plastic bags in large retail stores b...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the past three years, the nonprofits Save the Mermaids, Surfrider, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper and LoaTree have been working to bring the issue of single-use plastic bags in large retail stores before the city council. Thanks to their efforts, and those of countless community members, the plastic bag ban went before the Santa Barbara City Council April 19. I know those community members who have supported us in the past will continue to do so, for they have already signed petitions, written letters and called their council members. I am not writing this to preach to the choir. My intention now is to create some healthy debate with the members of this community who oppose the bag ban.</p>\n<p>I will first try to convince you that a ban on plastic bags is imminently necessary by appealing to your sense of environmental stewardship and humanity. Plastic bags are the blight of our beautiful beach community, the ocean ecosystem and defenseless animals. In an editorial on June 24, 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that plastic bags are the third most common form of trash found on California beaches. From the beach, these bags make their way into large ocean gyres and accumulate to form something out of a science fiction movie — surreal, submerged landfills called trash gyres.</p>\n<p>There are now trash gyres forming in all five of the major ocean basins, which we know little or nothing about. The California Progress Report noted that plastic bags have contributed to the death or injury of 267 species. How many species is it fair to harm for one species’ benefit?  Animals provide vital ecosystem functions we depend on for our survival. If they go extinct, we go extinct.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Which brings me to my next point: Even if you are not compelled to ban plastic bags for the health and happiness of 267 animal species, maybe you will be convinced to change for your own good. In 2008, researchers of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation found that 35 percent of all fish in the northern Pacific Ocean have ingested plastic. Some fish have ingested as many as 83 pieces. So now consider what happens when a fish ingests this plastic, assimilating it as part of its body, and then we eat that fish.</p>\n<p>Among the chemicals contained in plastic bags that we consume in seafood are lead, cadmium, mercury and the carcinogen diethylhexyl phthalate. Charles Moore, the founder of Algalita, described this phenomenon as “the entire food web being contaminated by plastic.” The long-term effects of this level of plastic pollution in the food chain could lead to global epidemics of cancer and other illnesses if no action is taken and plastic continues to invade our environment.</p>\n<p>I know what you’re thinking now: You want to change, you really do, but banning plastic bags is not economically sound. But I am here to reassure you the economy will be fine with a few less plastic bags. It certainly hasn’t ruined the entire country of China, which banned plastic bags in 2008. Try reusing cereal bags, turkey oven bags, Ziplocs, bread bags and bags from retail stores instead of plastic grocery bags. You will realize you do not need that many bags in your life.</p>\n<p>When technology, consumer demand or resource availability changes in any industry, competitive companies must adapt and progress to stay relevant, which is the only way to remain economically viable. The plastic-bag makers want our money, so if we ban their product they will have to hire more engineers and scientists and get more creative. In an effort to stay relevant they may develop a whole new material — an alternative to plastic. Maybe they will discover that you can make bags out of trash or old bottles.</p>\n<p>Therefore, more jobs are created, not lost; science and human knowledge will advance and fewer plastic bags will be put on Earth to begin their thousand-year life cycle. I don’t claim to have the ability to predict the future, but I know when an industry giant as big as the American Chemistry Council — which represents plastic-bag makers like Exxon Mobil Corporation and Dow Chemical Company — is threatened, it will get creative and there will not be a significant loss of jobs.</p>\n<p>Plastic is a great invention. I agree with you on that. I only question the logic in using something that was designed to last forever when you intend to use it only once. I think we should see this bag ban not as a political battle, putting the environment up against economics, but as an opportunity for human progress. I truly believe that we can reconcile the environment and the economy by finding ways to do things that benefit both.</p>\n<p>Jackson Browne recently made an album about pollution in which he captured my emotion best: “If I could be anywhere in time and change the outcome, it would have to be now.”</p>\n<p>Robin Fisher is a third-year communication major.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36945\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/bag-ban-break-corporate-inertia-beach-pollution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36945\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/bag-ban-break-corporate-inertia-beach-pollution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/bag-ban-break-corporate-inertia-beach-pollution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/bag-ban-break-corporate-inertia-beach-pollution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/bag-ban-break-corporate-inertia-beach-pollution/","id":6194,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6193,6192,6191],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Human Logic Incapable of Disproving the Existence of God","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The “Ask an Atheist” column in last Friday’s edition of the Nexus featured Connor Oakes, Tyler Santander and Cameron Moody, who put forth a variety of arguments positing that suffering in the wo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The “Ask an Atheist” column in last Friday’s edition of the Nexus featured Connor Oakes, Tyler Santander and Cameron Moody, who put forth a variety of arguments positing that suffering in the world disproves the existence of God as an omnipotent — or at least loving — entity. </p>\n<p>It’s true that a continuing conundrum for western monotheists is the question put forth by last week’s column: If God is loving and omnipotent, why does he allow for suffering in the world? As was acknowledged in Friday’s column, the conventional answer by religious types is essentially some variant of the idea that suffering is the result of human sin, which is an inescapable consequence of human free will. </p>\n<p>Therefore, the religious apologist answers, in order for humanity to have free will, God must also allow for suffering. The opinion pieces in Friday’s issue variously attacked this line of logic, noting that if God is omnipotent, he should not be constrained on any level, and thus could have chosen to create a world where both freedom from suffering and free will could coexist. Even if this were a logical impossibility for the human mind, an omnipotent God would not be constrained even by this apparent contradiction. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because there is suffering in the world, the writers appeared to arrive at the conclusion that religious apologists must either accept that there is no omnipotent God — as he would not allow for suffering if he had the power to prevent it — or else that God is not loving, which would contradict a core tenant of the major monotheistic faiths. I think this argument disproves itself. If God is omnipotent, it is implied in Friday’s column that He can allow for supposedly illogical impossibilities — a world where there is free will, but that nonetheless has no suffering (and presumably no “wrong” choices). </p>\n<p>However, when Friday’s writers implied that the existence of suffering in the world must mean that God can be either omnipotent or loving, but not both, suddenly it is being reasoned that God’s nature is constrained by the very same logic the writers implied that He was freed of by his omnipotence in the former example. Essentially, if God’s omnipotence allows him to contradict reason itself, such that He could create a world with free will that is also without suffering, by the same token his omnipotence frees him from the constraints of logic to the extent that He could also create a world with suffering, such as ours, and yet be absolutely loving at the same time. </p>\n<p>On a side note, I think there’s a larger flaw in using logic to argue against the existence of God as understood by monotheists. Essentially, as Decartes noted with his use of the “evil daemon” concept, even human reason is not certain to the absolutely skeptical rationalist. To attempt to skewer faith in God — who is supposedly beyond human experience, and thus reason — by appealing to the limited experiences of the limited, and thus rational, human mind is as futile as applying a finite measuring stick to an infinite distance. Using reason, there is no way to create a compelling framework of “necessary” or “sufficient” circumstances to disprove, or prove, God’s existence. </p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-22/human-logic-incapable-disproving-existence-god/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-22/human-logic-incapable-disproving-existence-god/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-22/human-logic-incapable-disproving-existence-god/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-22/human-logic-incapable-disproving-existence-god/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-22/human-logic-incapable-disproving-existence-god/","id":6186,"author":{"id":563,"name":"Paul Jones"},"related":[6185,6184,6183],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stereotypes of Sexual Abstinence Harm Healthy Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My name is SF and I am celibate.

It has been a ridiculously long time since my last penetration, and I am here to defend my choice of abstinence.<br>\nI would first like to clarify that I am in no way claiming any kind of born-again virtuosity. I am merely confronting my lack-of-sack and presenting an argument in my defense. To be entirely honest, the thing is, I am sick of being treated like shit and then being expected to get on my knees and suck it up just so I can get laid.<br>\nYes, sex is amazing. But it definitely hasn’t been amazing with some of the people I have been with, and I’m starting to realize that I have no interest in reliving past mistakes. In order to have no regrets, one must wash, rinse and never repeat.<br>\nPopular, hypersexualized culture would have me believe that this humping hiatus I’m experiencing is a “dry spell” — as if I have become some kind of barren landscape victim to Mother Nature’s withholding of fertilization. When we choose to abstain until marriage, we are labeled virgins-in-waiting, but when we choose to abstain from sex post-cherry pop, we are cursed as victims of a drought. So I’m supposed to feel ashamed when I’m having “too much” sex and even more embarrassed when I’m not having any?<br>\nAs much as I hate giving in to gender stereotypes, this situation is so different for women than it is for men. I’m not saying that men are slaves to their animal urges and have no coital filter. What I am suggesting is that women are usually presented with more situations where saying no and fighting off sex with someone they aren’t down to sleep with is necessary.<br>\nAt risk of sounding like a bitter old maid, how the hell do guys expect intercourse to be the end result of these horrible, offensive “moves” they’re putting on? Mind you, I live in Europe, which means the men I deal with on a day-to-night basis are instantly creepier. Last weekend I literally had a guy applaud, whistle and say “bravo” to me in passing. If you are wearing skin-tight women’s pants and enough gel in your hair to lubricate Andre the Giant’s penis, you are not allowed to up the ante on your sliminess by being a douchebag.<br>\nOK, so I.V. boys don’t necessarily spank your ass in place of shaking your hand like Euro-men do. I’ll give you that. But enough of the cause and back to the not-so-erect effect.<br>\nFor whatever reason, many people choose not to fornicate, and these people are called prudes. I hooked up with a guy my friend introduced me to last week, chose not to have sex with him and was called a prude for that decision. Me? A prude? This is crazy!<br>\nSo I’m either a slut or a prude. Are these my only choices? I feel like Goldilocks. I can be too hot and too cold, but how much sex is just right for a woman to have?<br>\nThis is not a ‘dry spell’ or a ‘slow season.’ I could go home with some loser tonight and get laid. The point is that right now, I’m actually enjoying not having meaningless, respectless sex. And when I decide that no-strings-attached arrangements are what I want again, I’ll do that. Just stop labeling me, because I’m never going to find the perfect sexual formula.<br>\nOne of my best friends is a virgin, and she is one of the hottest, sexiest chicks I know. She’s not waiting for marriage or Prince Charming. She’s going to have sex when it happens and feels right, and I think that is absolutely wonderful. And even though she’s never been penetrated, she is an extremely sexual person. The number of dicks you’ve hosted for the night has nothing to do with how in tune you are with your sexual self.<br>\nThere may be some prudes who exist out there, but I sure as hell have never met one. Sexuality is so much more than whether your daiquiri is virgin or not. I know some olive oil bottles that have got it going on but are denounced because of their ‘extra virgin’ labels.<br>\nSo until someone decides what amount of sex is the perfect amount, and until someone treats me like a human being rather than a set of fleshy holes, I’ll be standing by and waiting. And yes, I’m as horny as a housecat in heat; but in retrospect, sometimes it feels really good to wake up alone.</p>\n<p><em></em><em><br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/","id":6444,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6443,6442,6441],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Facts, Not Faith","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dear Editor Begakis, While it is true that students should stop being apathetic about troubling issues they have the ability to change — but seem to think they cannot change — there is a problem w...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div>Dear Editor Begakis,</div>\n<div>While it is true that students should stop being apathetic</div>\n<div>about troubling issues they have the ability to change — but</div>\n<div>seem to think they cannot change — there is a problem with</div>\n<div>the rest of your column.

Dialogue must be opened between student and administrator to actively express our grievances. Student representatives need to understand, respect and know us, so they might influence a generally positive shift in the system, as opposed to looking after and supporting the bias of a select few. We need to defend our education by ensuring those we elect to represent our interests do just that.  Whether fighting for free and available parking or making sure we have access to Wi-Fi and a seat in every class, student leaders must act as guardians of our collective future, never succumbing to pressures that seem daunting or insurmountable. We are students all working toward the same goal, by remaining vigilant and united.

Just under one year ago, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted to pass the Social Host Ordinance, but only a few affected Isla Vista student residents were in attendance. More recently the county decided, with little student consultation, to spend tens of thousands of dollars of its limited resources to prohibit beach access during what would have potentially been Floatopia. Despite some valiant reactive efforts from affected communities, our campus maintains a climate where instances of hate can occur and remain improperly addressed. All the while, crucial student services, such as Student Mental Health Services, are losing funding, often to the point of being cut altogether. These are just a few issues that affect Isla Vista and our collective campus community.\t</p>\n<p>What first must be recognized is none of these issues can be fully and effectively addressed by a single student or group — even a single community. These issues require the cooperative collaboration of stakeholders across the campus, in addition to the support and energy of students who may not be directly affected. While some may consider these students to be apathetic, the Open People’s Party (OPP) believes those who are not involved in fighting the issues affecting our campus have been simply overlooked. Over 85 percent of our students are involved in something other than going to class, twice the national average of universities across the country.\t</p>\n<p>Student apathy can often be explained beyond students not caring about these issues. Either a) students are simply unaware of their ability to make a difference, b) with an increased pressure to take on extra units and find employment to mitigate the rising cost of tuition, students feel they simply do not have time to get involved and take action and/or c) students feel that because the issue does not directly affect their everyday lives, the issue does not warrant their attention.\t</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To overcome these hurdles, OPP candidates will take steps to inform every facet of the student body about these issues and the relevant organizations working toward tangible solutions. OPP’s executive and legislative slate consists of a rich diversity of students, from those heavily involved in Associated Students and other campus groups, to students who have never before had a realistic opportunity to become involved. Our slate has also been chosen based on our candidates’ ability to collaborate, both within and beyond our own ranks. By using our vast personal networks and modes of mass communication (including social networking mediums), we will ensure our campus is well-informed.\t</p>\n<p>But being informed isn’t enough. Many students must be pragmatic when faced with the difficult choice of either: Get a part-time job to make end’s meet, take on extra units to graduate earlier or get involved and take action. We believe there is room for a creative solution. Our candidates will work toward designing a program to award academic units to those whose hard work extends beyond the classroom. This will not require any funds (which our campus doesn’t have and we as students shouldn’t pay) and will serve to mitigate the ever-present issue of crashing classes.\t</p>\n<p>After student knowledge and personal circumstances allow for increased involvement, we as the student government will encourage every facet of the campus to take on the causes that affect students. Those in all communities must work toward our common goals. Our party is called the Open People’s Party because we are open to everyone and welcome as many ideas and perspectives as possible.\tAbove all, involvement starts with your own personal interest to become informed. When these next two weeks bring a storm of campus enthusiasm, please take the time to read about the candidates and participate in our campus democracy.\t</p>\n<p>Harrison Weber is the presidential candidate for Open People’s Party (OPP).</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36032\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36032\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/","id":6192,"author":{"id":558,"name":"Harrison Weber"},"related":[6191,6190,6189],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Disciplined Religious Chastity Captivates the Promiscuous","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The life of an exchange student is a constant influx of new experiences, knowledge, food, ideas and people — basically whatever you can put into your mouth, grab by the hand or both.

Indeed, my classmate is a strictly adhering Muslim from northern Morocco whose religious beliefs forbid him to indulge in any form of sexual gratification until marriage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>Personally, I have always considered myself to be much more spiritual than religious, favoring general morality over the specificities of organized religion. Although I have chosen this particular spiritual path, I am of course aware that credence in religion is the foundation of many people’s lives. Likewise, sexuality, either the performance or restraint thereof, is as important in personality determination. The choice this young man has made about his sexuality is a determining factor of who he is, and this is all rooted in his faith.</p>\n<p>If religion plays a major role in one’s sexuality, and sexuality is a key component to one’s lifestyle, where does that leave the body’s desire to seek pleasure in the eyes of religion? Sex, kissing, touching or at the very least flirtation is how we mingle. It’s our way to break the ice and test compatibility. Could my perfect sexual match pass me by because he’s waiting and I’m not pure enough? How can we ever find someone to marry and have all this ‘sinless’ sex with if we are taught to be ashamed of that desire in the first place? Could faith and the learned avoidance of earthly pleasures be keeping us from finding love?</p>\n<p>In the book of Genesis, before Adam’s rib-baby gives into temptation and fucks up any chance we future generations may have had at sexuality free of remorse or disdain, a fascinating sentiment felt by both Eve and her male counterpart is highlighted. To quote the Old Testament following the creation of Eve, “And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed” (Genesis 1.2-25). It is not until paradise is lost that any shame is felt between the two unclothed individuals. Thus, there is a moment when bodily sexuality and spiritual sensuality are completely at one, and neither is something to be embarrassed about.</p>\n<p>I admire the steadfast devotion many of my friends have for their faiths, so I truly mean no disrespect when I say that if I were religious, I would like to believe in a higher power that would want me to be proud of the body I have been given and not feel ashamed about the way I consent to use it. I do not choose to see my sexuality as inherently evil. Perhaps this is why I could not imagine subjecting myself to the life of self-restraint my colleague and so many others have chosen.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I am utterly captivated by such discipline. The fact that someone can feel so strongly about what he/she believes as to completely cut out a part of human nature is pretty incredible. So I’m thinking it’s time for secular and devout communities to come to a major compromise, because if there’s one thing I do believe, it’s that a religious debate between believer and nonbeliever cannot be won.</p>\n<p>When it comes to sexuality and religion, it’s as simple as this: withhold judgment. My promiscuity should be of as much concern to you as your repression is to me — none at all. The majority of the population isn’t making sexual decisions to personally offend another party. Just be who you are and let everyone else do the same.<br>\nAnd if there is a God, I can tell you that he’s getting a whole lot of ironic attention from my orgasms. Now, do climax screaming fits count as prayer?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/","id":6443,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6442,6441,6440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex Columnist Kisses a Girl and Likes It: The Beauty of Exploration","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Doctor, here are my symptoms: I am confused, I’m questioning my identity and ability to reason and my genitals are swelling up like an ocean wave at the sight of a hot chick.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Doctor, here are my symptoms: I am confused, I’m questioning my identity and ability to reason and my genitals are swelling up like an ocean wave at the sight of a hot chick.

Why does it feel so natural to redirect my flirtation toward a woman at the slightest hint of curiosity? Maybe it’s because I write this column and want to prove to myself that I am as progressive and experimental as I urge all of you to be. Or perhaps, and this seems clearer to me every time I broach the subject, assigning a title to my sexuality no longer makes sense. If I am heterosexual and yet lust after women, even bisexuality doesn’t feel like the right fit. Now where’s the receipt for that Robert Pattinson blow-up love doll?</p>\n<p>I used to think bisexuality was like a gateway drug. Surely swinging both ways could only be a temporary distraction on the way to the gay train. But this assumption also discriminated by gender. Swapping a beer-soaked kiss with my best friend to rev up some guy’s engine didn’t make me lesbian, but a guy who dabbles in dick was clear as gay. Though a man’s hairy asshole doesn’t seem like something I would think a straight-shooter would crave on the weekends after a few sake bombs too many, who am I to say that scoping out the playing field isn’t part of the heterosexual experience? Why are we constantly being told to come out of closets we were never trapped in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For those of you who have never been acquainted, I’d like to introduce you to Dr. Alfred Kinsey, a scientist who studied human sexuality in the 1940s and ‘50s. One of his most well-known contributions is the Kinsey scale, which rates sexual orientation from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual). What Kinsey suggested — which I firmly believe to be true — is that sexuality is not as black and white as the survey categories we’re used to squeezing ourselves into. I may be heterosexual with a rare tendency toward incidental homosexuality, or a homosexual who is almost equally attracted to partners of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p>Ok, I’m boring myself just writing this. The point I’m trying to get across is that I would classify myself as a two and I think you should consider opening your mind to a new way of viewing your own sexuality. Maybe your straight road has a few more windy kinks in it than you thought.</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve stripped our brains bare of limitations and conventions, maybe it’s time to remind all you swingers out there that with the rejection of borders comes the possible negligence of necessary boundaries. Just because you’re breaking free of your prescribed sexual identity doesn’t mean you can forget that when it comes to relationships, infidelity is infidelity, no matter what brand of genitalia your flavor of the week may possess. Unless your partner is involved, which is probably his fucking dream come true, a taste of twat is as potent as the scent of another man’s cologne on your dress.</p>\n<p>So if you feel imprisoned by your supposed sexual identity and want to explore, ease into it. I’m sure vagina is an acquired taste, just like a fine wine or a conservative’s sense of humor. Just stay true to yourself and spit out anything you don’t like. You can’t dislike something you’ve never tried.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, saying I’m straight somehow implies that any experimentation I indulge in is crooked. If I don’t feel heterosexual, homosexual or even bisexual (since my tendencies toward each sex are hardly equal), maybe I’ll just settle with being, well, ambidextrous.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/","id":6442,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6441,6440,6439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Secretary of Labor Defends Healthcare Reform Provisions","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act a year ago this week.

The law enacts significant health insurance reforms that will take effect over the next several years. But one very important piece of that law is already in place, and it may directly benefit you.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act ensures that college students and young adults can stay on their parents’ employer-provided health care plans until age 26. In years prior, many health plans and issuers dropped young adults from their parents’ policies because of their age. That left countless college students, recent college graduates and other young people with little recourse — and worse: no health insurance. Historically, some 30 percent of young adults have been uninsured, a rate far higher than that of any other age group.</p>\n<p>But young people don’t need health insurance, right? The statistics say otherwise: One in six young adults today is faced with a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma, and nearly half of uninsured young adults report problems paying medical bills.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The new law ensures you have an option when it comes to your health care. This is important as you continue through school, as well as when you transition into the job market, since you may find that health care coverage is not immediately available through your employer. Or you may work part time. You may choose to continue your education and go to graduate school, or take time off to travel and pursue volunteer opportunities.</p>\n<p>It allows you to remain on your parents’ plan, or rejoin it until age 26, even if you no longer live with your parents, are not a dependent on their tax return or are no longer a student. This new flexibility even applies if you are married. You are guaranteed the same benefits and at the same price that is available to other dependents.</p>\n<p>More health care improvements are on the way and many may also directly benefit you. Already, coverage cannot be denied for those under age 19 because of a pre-existing condition. By 2014, denying coverage to anyone based on a pre-existing condition will be banned; annual dollar caps on care, which are already limited, will be prohibited; state-based health insurance exchanges will create a new marketplace, giving more employers and millions of Americans the ability to purchase affordable coverage.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act is based on the simple belief that every American — and that includes college students — deserves access to high-quality, affordable health care. Only one year after it was signed into law, that belief is becoming reality.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/","id":6227,"author":{"id":592,"name":"Hilda L.
