Hyperproductivity can lead to burnout and emotional fatigue in a time when both physical and mental health should be our number one priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am of the opinion that relying on fictional media is a healthy coping strategy, especially during times of globally shared trauma. Fiction evokes strong emotions that help us process our tumultuous reality in a physically and emotionally safe environment, as well as offers an escape from our anxiety-ridden reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As psychology professors Raymond A. Mar and Keith Oatley </span><a href=\"http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2010_01.dir/pdfc8vBXO7Maa.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write in their study on “the function of fiction,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> narrative fiction “[offers] models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simplification, and compression…[creating] a deep immersive simulative experience of social interactions for [the audience].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is slightly depressing to consider, absorbing Netflix’s character-driven teen dramedies like “Never Have I Ever” and “The Half of It” may help us to subconsciously practice social interaction in a time when our in-person conversations are entirely limited to mealtime chats with family members or housemates. In its own way, Netflix’s original content is preparing us for a post-isolation world, when we will have to relearn how to interact with people other than the members of our household in order to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/4/16/21213635/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-legacy-quarantine-state-of-mind-frugality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break out of the “quarantine state of mind.”</span></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn down the lights, brew some tea and grab your favorite snack, because if there’s one curve we don’t need to worry about flattening in these trying times, it’s Netflix usage.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this “immersive simulative experience” to the extreme, Dan Olson of the YouTube channel Folding Ideas revealed in </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsSzrVhdVuw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his March 31 video “I Can’t Stop Watching Contagion”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has watched the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contagion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “over fifteen times in the last few weeks.” He is not alone in this grim fascination, for he reports that “according to Netflix, at the time of writing, it is the second most-watched thing in Canada.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem like a self-destructive plot to amplify anxiety, but as Olson puts it, “watching a disaster film in a disaster [exposes us] to what we’re already experiencing. Amplifying existing emotional states, it works as a form of emotional inoculation. I am scared and anxious and uncertain, and so I will make myself more scared and more anxious and more uncertain, because it’s still fiction. It’s still safe. It still has an end. It is bounded.”  There is a certain comfort in witnessing the resolution of a large-scale pandemic, the real-world equivalent of which still has no end in sight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps to explain the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan/status/1249803779794296832?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sudden attention in the Twitter meme-iverse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the oblivious beachgoers and irresponsible mayor of 1975’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaws.” While the parallels to our current reality are amusing at best and disturbingly uncanny at worst, we have something to learn from movies like “Jaws”: how to deal with a disaster or, perhaps more informatively, how local institutions, federal governments and even individual citizens can mishandle their response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond fiction’s practically and emotionally instructive qualities, it also provides the core psychological necessity for a society seemingly in freefall: escapism.

But Animal Crossing has reached </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/tech/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-quarantine/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its special kind of monumental success</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a two-fold reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that it’s creators have mastered the </span><a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/kawaii-art-japanese-culture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawaii aesthetic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Animal Crossing’s  endearing graphics and overall satisfying gameplay. Nintendo has long been a revolutionary titan in the video game industry, and Animal Crossing is just one of its exceptional successes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is timing. Quarantine has the world flipped upside down. Nothing makes sense, and nearly everyone and their mothers are coping with the newfound anxiety of doing simple tasks (like going to the grocery store and spending sleepless nights wondering if they have enough Lysol wipes). This is an unprecedented time. Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The melody of a wind chime plays. Your friends are fishing, catching butterflies and hunting for fossils. There’s not a single care in the world. There are bonfires on the beach, coconuts in the trees and the sunsets are colored in dreamy pastels. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Crossing today is what Bob Ross paintings were to the 80’s. Or maybe what Mr. Rogers was to the 70’s: singularly calming, serene and carefree. It’s the nonmedical treatment to the chaos that is our current cultural moment: a global pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first downloaded Pocket Camp, Animal Crossing’s smartphone app equivalent to the real game, I hoped it would cure my addiction to Solitaire and prove to be more interesting than Sudoku. Now, at Level 101 with a pimped-out campsite and tons of smartly dressed anthropomorphic friends, I think I can confidently say that I get the hype </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it’s real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve logged a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of time on this app. When I say scary, I mean it’s too embarrassing to admit aloud. Let’s just say I’ve set alarms in the middle of the night to make sure my </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animal friends have enough lychee fruits and horned dynastids. I don’t even know what a dynastid is, but you can bet I’ll be tapping my phone like a psychopath at three in the morning to catch them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stigma around “gamers” is real, though. But the judgment that used to plague the idea of spending hours staring at a screen seems to be temporarily lifted thanks to the quarantine. There’s only so many Alexis Ren ab workouts I can attempt and whipped coffee one can make in a day. I’m on TikTok, applying to summer jobs on Handshake and becoming a real Martha Stewart in the kitchen, but nothing feels more satisfying or relaxing than playing Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Camp is a judgement-free, Zoom-free, CNN-free zone. I don’t have to listen to the daily litany of lies our president rants about, I don’t have to read about the rise of death tolls without an end in sight, and I don’t feel guilty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarantine is a uniquely strange time to begin new things, like learn a hobby, level up on Duolingo, save your GPA, go on virtual Bumble dates and an endless amount of self-care. But, most importantly, it’s a time to stop thinking that the things that give you pleasure are indulgent and unproductive. No one that’s alive has ever lived through anything like this. So use this time the way you want to, do the things that make you genuinely happy and add me on Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson wants you to remember to have compassion for yourself.

Nowadays, I just sleep big-spoon style with my laptop, flip the screen onto a Zoom meeting, garnish my webcam with a Minecraft virtual background and learn the exact same concepts the professor would have been explaining in a lecture hall — except I’m at home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the creativity of many students has sparked support, laughter, shock and several memes as Zoom experiences become ubiquitous across the internet. Although there are many advantages and disadvantages of the digital switch, I found about three of each category that encapsulate the polarity of short-term effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new system allows for maximum flexibility; a student can study anytime and anywhere, such as inside their home obviously, and review recorded lectures as many times as they want. Another advantage is more individual attention and confidence. Have you ever felt like your question might be too dumb to blurt out in front of your peers? Well, since all interactions are now conducted through screens, that fear is much less of a deterrent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, online classes help you meet interesting people. The number of personalities that a single Zoom meeting projects is staggering. I have seen backgrounds that show a favorite Nickelodeon show setting, I have seen pets of all shapes and sizes (one student had a pet parasitic flatworm named Gary), but most importantly, I see you. I see individuals who probably shared a class with me in Phelps or Campbell Hall, and yet I never knew they existed. What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, online learning also presents certain challenges. At first, I thought, “How could there be any disadvantage to staying at home and learning when I want to?” Well, believe it or not, online classes require more time than on-campus courses. Since typing can be much slower than speaking, typing out questions for your professor and/or TA might take up more of your time. Also, many students are now reading significantly more than they were during standard class instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disadvantage is the sense of isolation. I know a handful of people who need to be in a social setting to study, who cannot focus without the subtle whispers in the library or giggles in a study room. Also, there isn’t much external support in an online environment. In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the most significant disadvantage of online education from home is procrastination. Procrastination has become a practical skill in the minds of many college students. Despite many working on fixing this bad habit of waiting to start assignments until the final hour, the new online environment makes it doubly challenging to overcome this habit and get stuff done without a set schedule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are mixed reviews related to the change from in-person lectures to online classes. However, the short-term effects are manageable and as time progresses students become more accustomed to the new norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what will happen as lectures linger in the online realm, and students begin to realize that in-person conferences weren’t as necessary as they seemed to be?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could potentially cause an increase in dropout rates. A 2011 </span><a href=\"https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study from Columbia University’s Community College Research Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CCRC) showed that community college students from Washington were more likely to drop from online courses than traditional ones. In fact, the completion rate of conventional classes was 90%, while online classes saw a rate of 82%. Furthermore, the study also showed that students who took online courses were less likely to transfer to another college or complete a degree altogether. By just taking one online class during the fall, the students from the CCRC study were 34% more likely to drop out after a single year, compared to 26% taking traditional courses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just one online class, the chances of dropping out increased by 8%. Can you imagine how an entirely online curriculum will affect the higher educational system?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering all of this, I believe that the greatest effect of the switch to online education will be adjustments to student tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The realization that I can learn the same amount of information from my bed as in a lecture hall makes me wonder if I really need to be paying so much to earn my degree from a prestigious university, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/16/college-students-are-rebelling-against-full-tuition-after-classes-move-online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I’m not the only one</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students across the world have the same concerns about the lack of a tuition adjustment in the wake of the complete change in curriculum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On its own, the price to attend a UC is gobsmacking compared to a community college. Of course, the large price tag assumes you are receiving an estimable education at one of the top research institutions in the nation. However, nobody is on campus anymore! And we won’t be there anytime soon, as </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2020-04-13-covid-19-update-summer-sessions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Yang has already informed students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that summer courses beginning in June and July will be online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quite frankly, I feel bad for those paying out-of-state tuition; non-residents who are paying over 15 grand to have online classes. No amount of Zoom is worth that much. Something has to be done with the current state of tuition. </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A petition was formed in response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to adjusting the spring 2020 tuition here at UCSB with the hope that Chancellor Yang would take notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving over 6,000 signatures on the petition, and despite having to lock myself indoors, watch Zoom lectures throughout the week and learn from a laptop, the tuition I pay is precisely the same. I genuinely believe that in the long run, students will realize that their experience with online classes was relatively close to learning face to face with a professor and that paying the same price for Zoom lectures at home instead of an actual learning environment (on campus) is inequitable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sooner or later, the changes caused by the online transition will start to mold the fabric of higher education.

We also love how attendees are able to annotate directly on the shared screen for everyone to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not know how to use our resources, don’t worry! Spend an hour or two with friends, exploring our platform. Play with virtual backgrounds. A quick search on our website can answer your queries. You can also reach out to your instructors for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your instructors will arrive a second before class starts, so don’t worry about leaving your place to arrive on time. Our instructors have excellent interpersonal skills. They like to wait a few minutes before officially starting a lecture: greeting students, oversharing or sitting in charming silence. I also certainly respect how our instructors have transitioned their lectures to be Zoom-friendly. No more iClicker questions. No more class readers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe in freedom of expression, allowing our students to demonstrate their individuality through their nicknames and chat room conversations. However, if a neighbor’s lawn mower roars, if your sister decides to blast reggae music or if your dog demonstrates their yearn for your attention through intense barking in the middle of a lecture, we expect you to mute yourself. Effective communication is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to turn on your camera, so the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawthorne effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensures that you are not goofing off.

We support well-rounded students who participate in extracurriculars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also understand that everyone has different personalities. If you are a little bit shy or you have just woken up from a fat nap, or are in the process of diving back into a fat nap, nobody will be offended if you turn off your camera. But imagine your professor speaking to named black screens. Think of how lonely and awkward they must feel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We trust that you are capable of taking care of your own wellness. If you are hungry, bring a snack to your back-to-back Zoom meetings or bring your device to the kitchen. Meditate in between classes.

Gone are the days of being bombarded in the Arbor, struggling to find a seat in the crowded lib or trying to make it out of a rush-hour bike lane. Quarantining makes it difficult to feel connected to others and even easier to feel alone. Being cut off from people and resources for such extended periods of time can be hard on your mental health. The constant influx of news updates surrounding the pandemic is overwhelming and anxiety producing, and there is a plethora of false information being spread across online platforms. Despite this, social media is more necessary now than ever before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is often portrayed as useless and a killer of productivity, amounting to nothing but mindless scrolling through feeds. It’s been criticized for causing </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/is-social-media-contributing-to-the-stigma-around-depression-and-anxiety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feelings of social isolation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fear of missing out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Now, in a time of physical isolation, there’s nothing to miss out on. Social media has become invaluable as a tool that can help us feel a more intimate connection to others and restore a sense of normalcy to the chaos uprooting our lives. Without the physical markers of everyday life that we have come to depend on, many of us may be losing track of time, our responsibilities and our lives in general. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I witness my Twitter timeline collectively descend into insanity every few hours, I am consoled by the knowledge that I am not alone in these feelings. We might all be scared, but at least we can know that we’re all in this together. Being able to make fun of our nervousness and unease with others who share these sentiments is an immense source of comfort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sudden shift to online courses, taken in isolation, has proven itself to be a difficult adjustment. Seeing memes shared on Facebook about other students’ complete lack of a sleep schedule or motivation to do any assignments is reassuring in that the experiences we are struggling with are shared. We can’t share these experiences in person, but this makes it all the more essential that we can share them online. That is, for those of us fortunate enough to be able to be bored and concerned by these challenges alone, social media has taken on an even more critical role in our lives.</span></p>\n<p>With the possibility for spontaneous social interaction removed from our daily lives, social media is now the only way we can stay in touch with others on a large scale. Many of us have started feeling the need to communicate with and be perceived by our peers in a way reminiscent of in-person interaction. This is evident on social media in the surge of viral challenges: from posting unflattering pictures just to take them down the next day, doing push-ups in a video chain, filling out oddly specific bingos or just finding excuses to tag 10 friends.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us have started feeling the need to communicate with and be perceived by our peers in a way reminiscent of in-person interaction.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, there might not be anybody listening to each and every song from your 30-day song challenge, but what matters is that you feel like you’re staying connected. Illusory or not, this sense of connectivity and community is so important in preserving our sanity and preventing us from feeling isolated. Social media has also supported the rise of quarantine hobbies, and every Dalgona coffee made or TikTok dance learned brings us one step closer together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending too much time online is usually never a good thing, but the digital world is quickly becoming the social reality for us for a substantial part of the near future. The pandemic has brought with it a social crisis, and social media is helping us ease this loneliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the days spent alone blur together, videoconferencing sites like Zoom are helping us redefine and reconstruct our social lives. The past feels a lifetime away, the future is scarily uncertain, so we’re left trying to share as much of the present as possible. Social media allows us to feel connected to those whose presence we miss, creating a virtual community from wherever we are. Even though we think of what life was like before we were thrust into isolation, this time spent apart from loved ones will make the days together more valuable. We may feel lonely, but social media reminds us that we are far from alone. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo hopes this article finds you well in these strange and uncertain times.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Veronica Vo</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Veronica Vo is an opinion staff writer and a second year psychology major.

I, too, find myself criticizing every photo I take in an attempt to make it “Insta-perfect” — or at least adequately edited and appropriately captioned.  However, when it comes down to it, I would much rather scroll through Facebook or pin recipes on Pinterest. Call me old fashioned, but I find myself missing the olden days of social media when we weren’t so focused on aesthetics and unattainable ideals. It was a time that produced real and intimate content.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scrolling through my Instagram profile — including the archive section, where my most embarrassing posts continue to haunt me — I noticed apparent shifts in the aesthetics of my profile. Looking back, I remember just snapping a photo and uploading it to my Instagram profile right away, writing whatever caption came to mind at that moment and not editing anything. My oldest posts include a photo with my parents at my middle school graduation and a photo documenting the moment I found out I got into my first-choice high school. However, these innocent and intimate photos changed as I got older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who remembers the infamous white-border Instagram trend? This was the trend that started the obsession with curating an “aesthetic” profile. I remember furiously downloading the Squaready app that my friends told me about and learning about the different filters that would lighten your photo to match the “white aesthetic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon enough, other editing conventions replaced white borders. Facetune launched alongside a torrent of other airbrushing apps. Now I find myself scrolling through overly edited photos of popular Instagram models and influencers, many of whom look the same because they all see Dr. Nassif in Beverly Hills or schedule monthly visits with aesthetician and lip-filler connoisseur Joanna “the Nurse” Yoo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After scrolling through repetitive, overly curated content on platforms like Instagram, I find myself seeking refuge in Facebook’s feel-good content. I can’t even tell you how many times I have teared up watching videos of soldiers coming home to surprise their families or how many Tasty cooking videos I have saved on my profile. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook is the mother of social media platforms — a long-lost gem among social media platforms in an age centered around unrealistic expectations and overly curated content.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Facebook </span><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remains the most popular social media platform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with over </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.45 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> active monthly users, its user demographics have drastically shifted in recent years. Once </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/12/is-facebook-for-old-people-over-55s-flock-in-as-the-young-leave\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">named</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the “spring chicken of the internet,” Facebook has become the preferred platform of our parents and grandparents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, Facebook changed its home feed algorithm to lessen content from businesses and give priority to posts coming from family and friends. As such, photos posted on Facebook are generally more “authentic” than those posted on platforms such as Instagram. While in 2018 Facebook changed its algorithm to prioritize consumers, Instagram </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/technology/instagram-algorithm-change.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wanted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its feed to “feel more fresh” and changed its algorithm to boost newer posts to the top of users’ feeds. To me, it’s very clear that on Facebook users are more concerned about sharing their genuine lives with their friends and families than impressing the masses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t believe me, just open up your Facebook and Instagram feeds and compare the two. I guarantee that countless beautiful, nearly naked Instagram models populate your Explore page, promoting various brands that you’ve probably never heard of. Looking at your Facebook home page, you might see your cousin who lives out of state post photos from her baby shower, or you may see a status update that one of your friends got the job they’ve been hoping for. This here is the difference between their respective contents: commercial versus real. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram is mainly used for flaunting aesthetic photos, Twitter is primarily for snarky commentary and TikTok is for short quirky videos. Facebook combines them all: It can be used for keeping up with old friends, reading the news and professional networking. It is also a direct feeder for other social media platforms. For example, you can find a lot of content from Twitter on your Instagram feed. You can also connect your Instagram posts to your Facebook profile, share your Pins and repost your Tweets on your Facebook Timeline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook is the mother of social media platforms — a long-lost gem among social media platforms in an age centered around unrealistic expectations and overly curated content. When you find yourself feeling insecure after scrolling through your Instagram feed or spending way too much time stalking Chrissy Teigen’s Twitter profile, check in with your long-lost friend, Facebook.

Of course you have; you’re a human living in the 21st century. Have you ever caught yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media and been jealous of something that someone is doing? You are not alone; I tend to follow people who are way cooler than myself. Most importantly, have you ever caught yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media and felt sad that you aren’t as “happy” or “fulfilled” as someone on social media?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have never been someone who gets crazy insecure from looking at other people’s social media profiles. Sure, I wish I could travel the world like those influencers, or get paid for selling “miracle” tea, but I’ve always been pretty good about taking things with a grain of salt. However, coming into my second year at UCSB, I began seeing all these people doing so many cool things on social media, and it made me question if I was missing out. All the sorority girls looked so happy together with all their 400 friends! All the Adventure Program kids seemed so freakin’ peaceful and content with their outdoorsy lives. All the people who like playing die and chilling with their homies seemed fulfilled, like they couldn’t ask for anything more. Seeing all these people on social media who seemed so adult, I questioned if I should be doing more to get on that level of happiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With school starting, I pushed myself to get involved in more things in order to find more places that made me feel comfortable, fulfilled and just genuinely happy like the people I follow seemed to be. I joined a sorority, started surfing with Excursion Club and felt that amazing freedom that comes with living in Isla Vista in a house with all new people.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next week, I met a bunch of new people in these activities, through my new housemates and in classes. Many of these people looked like those I had seen on social media. Talking to them, though, I learned how much of a struggle it was to find friends. How difficult it was to branch out. How overwhelming school was, and how homesick they were. How lonely, stressed and worn out they felt. These people that had seemed so satisfied with their lives on their social media suddenly seemed … normal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let me get something straight. Everyone has their problems and of course social media cannot hide the fact that we are young adults in college. But social media does have the ability to hide all of the daily insecurities and worries that all people experience. When scrolling through Instagram or Snapchat stories, sometimes we forget that no one constantly feels secure in who they are. Everyone has bad days. Everyone feels lonely and sad sometimes. Everyone gets stressed at some point, whether about school, friends or life. Everyone wants to fit in and feel included.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up is about figuring out what you want from yourself and your life. Living in a one-mile radius with thousands of other people who are looking for the same thing as we are only exacerbates the idea of fitting in on social media. We want to know that we are making the most out of our experience. We want to feel loved, included and to not feel like we are missing out as we see those around us doing so many amazing things. However, we have to realize that everyone has the same insecurities as we do, and that it is human nature to feel this way. That girl who goes on vacations constantly is not all sunshine and rainbows on the inside 24/7. That guy who seems to just have so many damn friends faces the same times of loneliness many of us feel sometimes. Those people who seem so put together are close to falling apart at the seams, just like us. The important thing to understand is that social media never shows these things because who likes to expose their insecurities that they too try to forget about?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, let’s stop scrolling and scrolling when we are bored. Let’s work to limit our time that we spend looking at thousands of people on social media. Let’s catch ourselves when we begin to notice that we are comparing ourselves to incomplete identities. Behind the scenes of those photos lie a list of insecurities and problems that would never be seen on Instagram. I have friends who seemed to be having the time of their lives, but ultimately have transferred schools, started therapy or are just as stressed as the rest of us. You probably know people too! So, it’s time we stop comparing ourselves to these partial images we constantly subject ourselves to, and realize that happiness simply does not look the same for everyone. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley is a second-year Isla Vistan who may or may not be scrolling through social media right now.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdf73e8bd5e8251c5cdf749f032f20a2?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdf73e8bd5e8251c5cdf749f032f20a2?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/grace-wiley/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Grace Wiley</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Grace Wiley is a Global Studies and Spanish double major who is incredibly excited to be writing for the Opinion section of the Daily Nexus!</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:gracewiley@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/a-social-media-awakening/","id":6282,"author":{"id":796,"name":"Grace Wiley"},"related":[6281,6280,6279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Fault in Our Star Signs","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2019-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zodiac.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zodiac.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Does astrology have all the answers?

From </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/books/astro-poets-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dedicated to posting daily horoscopes with half a million followers to </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drunkstrology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pages that relate the signs to viral memes, astrology has long since graduated from the back pages of printed newspapers and taken on a life — and cult following — of its own. From Urban Outfitters graphic tees to dating apps, it has infiltrated nearly all domains of social life — I recently came across a Tinder bio that read, “Add me on Co-Star.” It seems as though the astrology obsession has become a cultural norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the initial weeks after I downloaded the app, I let the daily horoscope notifications pile up.

On the day Co-Star sent me, “If you want people to communicate with your heart, you have to teach them the language it speaks in,” my sister and I had just resolved a week-long fight. When I received, “It’s time to grow past your fundamental injuries from when your primary caregivers failed to understand you,” it reminded me to stop wallowing and pull my head out of my ass. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instantly, I was hooked. I gave myself to the trusting hands of the cosmos. Doubts of “this is literally just a company who pays people to write these” and “it’s all about perception” got squashed by the immediate rush of validation and satisfaction I got from reading and confirming for the first time what a true Sagittarius I apparently was: headstrong, stubborn and spontaneous to a fault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself. That I didn’t need unique passions or interests because everybody seemed to already have their own ideas of who a Sagittarius was. It was more comforting than I cared to admit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, I would screenshot my horoscope and send it my friends, exclaiming, “That’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> me!” while hundreds of thousands of other Co-Star users did the same thing, claiming the generic platitude as their own. Still, it would give me an extra boost of confidence that would stay with me throughout the day.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-Star allows you to lean into a list of traits that the Internet says makes you a “total Virgo” and base your identity, quirks and strengths on a personality that has already been curated for you. For a time, it made being 20 seem simple. These accurate (or what coincidentally happened to be accurate) horoscopes gave me a sense of control over my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world. It asserts itself as a philosophy without room for doubt and provides a self-assured confidence that is extremely attractive. The 12 sun signs — based on birth month — are taken not as suggestions or fortunes, but as permanent and reliable fixtures in our society, each with their own set of “individualized” principles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stopped being a die-hard believer in astrology when I started to notice discrepancies between myself and what my sign was supposed to be. </span><a href=\"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagittariuses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are generous, idealistic, extroverted, cursed with an insatiable case of wanderlust and truth-seeking. They are “independent and strong-willed,” “natural born leaders,” “seductive” and “trailblazing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are wildly broad claims that feel more descriptive of a video game character than a real person. I don’t know anyone, let alone myself, who embodies </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of these statements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a defense for these blanket statements: the generalized qualities of the sun signs only scratch the surface of astrology. Apparently, your moon sign explains it all. And to figure out your moon sign you need to know what time you were born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what time I was born because I’m adopted, so I tried to deduce my moon sign by process of elimination. Each day, I read the horoscopes of all the moon signs and took note on which felt the most accurate. By the end of my two-week trial, 168 horoscopes later, I came to the conclusion that a Gemini moon seemed a likely fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this pseudo-experiment, I discovered I still had the same nagging feeling of incompleteness that I had when I first started. I didn’t feel a loyalty to any of the signs and was even beginning to doubt whether my Sagittarius-ness held any value. The fact that a Leo moon tended to gravitate to the spotlight more than a Cancer felt like arbitrary information, even silly. I didn’t possess the authority to claim I belonged to one over the other because I still didn’t have anything to prove it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d spent too much of my time and energy in the world of astrology to come out feeling just as confused as I had at the beginning. It felt like I was promised clarity on the condition that I figured out my birth time, and only then would I be able to access this wealth of knowledge about myself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A part of me knew that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. This piece of myself I’d attached so much value to and made myself feel guilty for not knowing was trivial. What was more revealing than anything was how far I had let myself spiral into an astrology obsession. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My faith was based on insecurity. I wanted (and still want) to fast-forward through my bumbling 20s and college years to this fully developed version of myself that doesn’t exist. I wanted it to be as easy as picking an avatar in a game, complete with attractive, likeable traits I didn’t have to work for or even think about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I could use astrology as a cure-all for my doubts and anxieties about the future. For reconciling the contradictions in my personality, justifying habits of self-sabotage, for not feeling like I was not 100% any one quality. Surely one day I would develop into the full-blown Sagittarius I was if I just believed a little more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me, I tried. I based entire relationships on whether our signs were compatible or not. Even worse, I judged other people for not believing in it too, this dogma based on fear and escapism posing as cute personality traits and trendy finger tattoos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of this summer, I realized I was cheating myself. I had avoided engaging and actually thinking about my choices and beliefs for an embarrassingly long time. Where I had once felt confident claiming all the ways I was “such a Sagittarius,” this persona began to feel meaningless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I did see clearly was how quickly I blindly attached myself to this belief in astrology. It was something to grasp onto, something that promised answers and truths that I became convinced I would never find without it. It assuaged feelings of self-doubt and social anxiety. I was learning to love the provided answers; I was learning to love not being me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little by little, I am learning how to relinquish my grip on astrology. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff astrologer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/broadly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Annabel Gat, puts it simply: “It’s a tool for self-reflection, it’s not a religion or a science. It’s just a way to look at the world and a way to think about things.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize that for most people, astrology doesn’t evolve into this type of unhealthy obsession and codependency. But I do question the underlying and often subconscious motivations of its young target audience. I do question its ability to influence its followers into a kind of group-think that poses as innocent, harmless fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying into astrology meant being content living my life like a game of Sims on autopilot. A choose-your-own-adventure, but even lazier because someone else had already chosen all the adventures for me. And that’s what astrology became for me: a way to escape my own life by stepping into an already-lived one. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After overcoming her astrology obsession, Pei Ja Anderson is spearheading an unpopular Co-Star cessation campaign.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b07cd1f42eb556b5b4d03ef08fe63e16?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b07cd1f42eb556b5b4d03ef08fe63e16?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/pei-ja-anderson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Pei Ja Anderson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Pei Ja Anderson is an opinion staff writer. She loves fighting the patriarchy as much as she loves bagel bites.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:peijaanderson@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/fault-in-star-signs-horoscopes-costar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/fault-in-star-signs-horoscopes-costar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/fault-in-star-signs-horoscopes-costar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/fault-in-star-signs-horoscopes-costar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/fault-in-star-signs-horoscopes-costar/","id":6318,"author":{"id":787,"name":"Pei Ja Anderson"},"related":[6317,6316,6315],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Should Past Mistakes Define a Person’s Future?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2019-06-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mistakes-e1561668804712.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mistakes-e1561668804712.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Social media posts are often perceived as private and impermanent.

While adults are quick to jump to the conclusion that we teenagers are solely to blame for sharing these thoughts on our social media platforms in the first place, some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the creation of social media is not the only aspect to which blame can be attributed.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kashuv has since apologized on his social media, </span><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">informing Harvard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has “grown” since the incident and that the comments were made “in private among equally immature high school students.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s defensive attitude does demonstrate an important point that many adults in our society fail to recognize: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging adults’ brains <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neuroscience-of-20-somethings-brain-young-adults_n_1840495\">continue to develop well into their 20s</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many members of our generation willingly recognize our mistakes and grow from them, but Kashuv misses the bigger picture in his apology: Racism is not something that can be simply brushed off as a mistake — it’s a form of serious bigotry. Kashuv’s claim that he has grown from comments made just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years ago is not the best defense. His statement not only ignorantly assumes that most high school students hold the same “immature” views as he did, but it also unfairly equates immaturity to acts of discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, comparing the opinions and mindsets of my 17-year-old self to those of my 19-year-old self does not reveal much variation — I still hold the same values of acceptance, environmental advocacy, etcetera as I did before. Sure, I have </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">matured </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over the last two years, but I have maintained the same core values of human decency in recognizing that we’re all humans regardless of the color of our skin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where I think some young adults of our generation go wrong: They brush off problematic dispositions as easily forgivable because others around us shared the same opinions or because these comments were made in “private,” when we are all aware of the traceability of our social media footprint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, it may seem like most young adults share the view that our past mistakes should not define our future chances at success, as we all have flaws. But this view should depend not only on the severity of our past mistakes but also on how we go about explaining them to the stakeholders who have the power to decide our futures. Kyle Kashuv failed in both of these areas. Harvard made the right move by standing its ground on rescinding Kashuv’s acceptance. It sends a message to all young adults to wake up and be conscious of the public display of their opinions and conveys that students with racist attitudes should not be accepted into universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is only prevalently displayed in our media today because Kashuv has such a wide platform, past mistakes can define any student. </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/18/what-leads-harvard-rescind-admission-racism-plagiarism-killing-your-mom/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2eb09e2ca060\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard has dropped numerous students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accused of sexual misconduct, those who have plagiarized and others who have made sexist and racist comments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Harvard’s revealment of students’ true moral character is honorable, not all students who have exhibited these behaviors have been caught. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my time at UCSB, I’ve heard of students writing notes on their Scantrons prior to exams, seen students using Google on their phones at the end of exams and witnessed racist exchanges and unwanted sexual advances, among other behaviors.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This brings up the issue of fairness. If students who have been caught cheating have had their admission revoked, what about the rest of the students who are admitted and cheat their whole way through college? Will future employers be able to see through these candidates in a short interview, or will they hire said candidates in the place of someone more deserving? This unfortunately seems like an issue that can only punish those who get caught and serve as a cautious warning to others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard’s policy on revoking admission also dangerously assumes that issues of plagiarism should be equated to much more serious issues of racism and sexual assault. Cheating on a quiz should not result in the same expulsory punishment as sexual harassment and discrimination. While cheating results in inhibiting one’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">own</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> personal success, harrassment and discrimination unequivocally affect </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in damaging ways. Therefore, it is not just up to us to hold ourselves accountable. It’s also the job of these institutions to mold a system that ensures fairness and a more in-depth evaluation of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s mistake was a very specific incident that does not shed light on all the problems our generation is tasked with fixing. Recently, more women and female stars have been facing criticism for taking private photos which have leaked, negatively affecting their public image. This is most evident in the case of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/21/18693604/bella-thorne-nude-photos-whoopi-goldberg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bella Thorne.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When hackers stole and threatened to release her nude photos, she released the photos herself before the blackmailers could. Whoopi Goldberg’s public disapproval of Thorne taking nude photos in the first place created a media storm when Goldberg said, “If you’re famous, I don’t care how old you are. You don’t take nude pictures of yourself.” While many agreed with Goldberg’s reaction, Thorne argued that Goldberg was unfairly shaming young women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Goldberg importantly points out the necessity of being aware of what follows us on our “cloud,” her comments shaming Thorne are problematic because they take the attention away from the bigger problem at hand: the objectification of women’s bodies and how they are consistently used against them. Women are encouraged to be more confident about their bodies — yet are shamed when they embrace them. In this and many other situations, women have been painted as the perpetrators of their own downfall, instead of the victims of these situations. Thorne doesn’t deserve to be shamed in the media because she was the victim of a photo hack that didn’t harm anyone, in sharp contrast to the damaging comments made by Kashuv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the bigger question is how to ensure women’s privacy is no longer violated instead of scapegoating them. The issue of leaked photos reveals the intricacy of young adults’ past mistakes — and how it is crucial to consider the complexity of those mistakes when determining whether or not they should affect someone’s future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants you to be aware of how your actions could affect your future or someone else’s.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

The idea of the public being interested in the products and activities of celebs is nothing new, but YouTube is a media outlet that is banking on this concept through vlogs. Some viewers who watch these videos may try to copy the beauty regimes of their favorite celebrities, but this could max out their credit card and/or distract them from the specific beauty and skin routine that’s best for them. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think there is anything wrong with watching these videos. YouTube is a great social media platform, especially when you’re a busy college student and don’t have enough time to watch a whole episode of TV. However, I don’t think it’s good if it becomes an obsession to imitate a celebrity or influencer’s lifestyle. When viewers copy influencer’s habits, it puts a lot of pressure on the individual. For example, Victoria’s Secret models have a lot of videos sharing their diet and exercises leading up to the annual fashion show, but these kinds of regiments can be unhealthy if the average person overdoes it in terms of exercising and dieting. Trying to be or look like someone else can enforce unhealthy expectations and a desire for unrealistic beauty goals. I know there are times when I have overworked my body, and it’s always good to take a step back and realize that I should be eating and working out to feel good instead of obsessing about looking a certain way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily routine videos just aren’t that interesting after a while. There are different channels I follow based on YouTubers that I think are funny or topics that I am fascinated by. But, there are only so many morning or nighttime routine videos I can watch. All of us have different routines, and seeing other people get ready in the morning just is not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exciting.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that it’s important to form healthy habits and regimens, and it’s always fun to get tips from others that you admire, but that doesn’t mean you have to copy everything they do. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is no shame in watching or liking these daily routine videos. Although, I do think it’s good to ask yourself why you watch them. Do you want to follow someone else’s lifestyle? I believe that it’s important to form healthy habits and regimens, and it’s always fun to get tips from others that you admire, but that doesn’t mean you have to copy everything they do. Trying Alexis Ren’s salad showed me that I am better off creating my own meal plan. There’s no harm in trying new foods and not liking them, as I did, but I realized that I’m happier preparing meals that I’ve grown up eating. I don’t need to copy anyone else’s diet, and I think it’s better to discover what you’re interested in on your own. Would you rather live someone else’s life or create your own?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this day and age, social media has created an environment of constantly comparing yourself to others or trying to follow trends. Why not just take a step back and find what makes you happy without basing it on other people’s choices? On social media, influencers show the kind of life that they choose to share with the world, and it’s important to realize that this lens might not be authentic or give the whole picture. I’d rather spend my early 20s discovering who I am as an individual rather than following the habits of celebrities and influencers who lead seemingly perfect lives. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala wants YouTube users to make healthy choices that fit their individual needs.</span></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/","id":6280,"author":{"id":681,"name":"Morgan Wiitala"},"related":[6279,6278,6277],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Social Media is Messing with our Memories","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2019-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FB-e1558652270410.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FB-e1558652270410.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jordan Curiel raises questions about the \"Memory\" tool featured on social media platforms.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At age 14, I fractured part of my hip at a dance competition.

Some people might find themselves smiling at the screen, remembering the gorgeous dresses, the snazzy suits and the good friends they danced the night away with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others might be greeted by a visual reminder of someone they wish they’d never met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A graduation photo could weigh like a rock in the pit of your stomach if you’re homesick, but the person sitting next to you in class might see an image of themselves in a cap and gown as a glowing reminder of how far they’ve come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every experience is subjective, so each person’s responses to these photos are going to be different. Memories are instant gateways to a flood of emotions, and sometimes what triggers a memory comes out of nowhere: a song, a place, a picture. Remembering is neither inherently good nor bad; it’s just a bunch of chemical reactions in the brain that make us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good or bad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For that reason, I’m constantly conflicted about these “Memories” functions that are beginning to pop up on many popular social media outlets. Sure, I get a kick out of them sometimes; when I come across a happy “memory,” I’ll feel nostalgic and send the picture to a best friend or my sister with a little heart and the caption “miss you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once in a while, frankly, these memories just suck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, a flashback to the group photo from my high school’s senior picnic might look perfectly fine to anyone who wasn’t there. They wouldn’t know that I spent the whole night before and much of that morning sobbing over my first breakup. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mostly remember pulling myself together just long enough to smile for the camera before calling my mom to pick me up because I was in no condition to drive home. When I look back at that photo of my smiling senior class squished together on a bus, I feel a visceral twinge in my stomach that makes me want to crawl into bed and hide all over again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I also vividly remember how frantic I was when I realized that the only picture I had of an old friend, whom I haven’t spoken to in years but who meant the world to me, had accidentally been thrown away while I was cleaning out a desk drawer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those treasured “Memories” on Snapchat was a snapshot of the glowing lights lining Santa Monica’s crowded streets. Seconds after capturing that moment, I had turned around and taken another snap of my best friend as he walked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the only time I ever got away with taking his picture.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If remembering those moments is so important, why rely on an app to keep them alive?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s not my best friend anymore; he’s not my anything anymore. But thinking about not having that one photo as evidence, as proof of what we used to be, nearly broke my heart in two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither of these instances have convinced me whether it’s better to hold on to memories or leave them in the past, but they make me question the concept of logging onto a social media platform and being forced to remember something that otherwise may never have crossed my mind. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to hold on or let go says something about what each of us values and holds dear. In deciding which memories to keep alive, we have to prioritize certain memories over other ones. We shouldn’t have to rely on an app to pick out which ones are important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes my sentimental side comes out and other times my “leave it all behind” side takes over.

These tech industries thought the cord of the standard earphones were essential to keeping them safe. Despite conflicting beliefs, AirPods have taken flight on our campus and have grown into a prominent status symbol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are much more expensive than other headphones, but they still have a special, attractive quality that elevates them above alternatives. With a price tag of $159, AirPods are a little more expensive than Powerbeats3, which cost around $100. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, </span><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/airpods-upgrade-2019-all-new-design-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16 million AirPods were sold in 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and approximately 55 million AirPods will have been sold by the end of 2019. This upward trend proves that AirPods will continue to be a desirable product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are becoming a cultural phenomenon and gaining widespread support. But are people buying AirPods just to gain elite status or for the convenience factor? With AirPods all around us, it’s difficult to distinguish the real reasons why people choose to own them. But I think social pressure and social status are a big part of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are still some who have not given in to the pressure, like Audrey Francis, a first-year communication major at UCSB. Francis says that AirPods are “expensive and unnecessary” and does not enjoy “the way the plastic Apple [headphones] feel.” She believes that on campus, AirPods “give you some kind of clout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, they mean a lot to people because they are an investment and allow them to listen to music. AirPods are a polarizing piece of technology and there is a continuous debate about whether or not they are even worth the hype.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, there is controversy surrounding Apple products versus non-Apple products. Some may say that Apple products are desirable solely due to their popularity. On the other hand, some argue that non-Apple products are of higher quality, and that the power of brand recognition means Apple doesn’t need to place as much emphasis on quality.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There tends to be a lot of backlash against people who choose to stick with the “inferior” technology, and many even consider Android phones to be lesser than their Apple competitors. Have you ever been put in a group chat with someone who has an Android? That person gets so much hate for the little green text bubbles that pop up on everyone’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">glorious </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone screens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tiny green text bubbles shouldn’t be linked to lower status but in reality, they are. There is always a small assumption that not having the most popular technology is due to one’s low economic status. Yet many fail to consider that even if someone is able to afford an iPhone, they may choose to go with another option due to personal preference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our society has advanced immensely in terms of technology. A phone itself is no longer a status symbol, even though it should be. In other countries, owning a phone — regardless of the brand — is a symbol of good economic standing. Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major factor that influences people to buy AirPods is social status, just as much as function or convenience.

In the last year, we’ve seen celebrities accused of sexual assault be “canceled” and all their work invalidated and boycotted. But it doesn’t stop there: celebrities that make just about any mistake fall into the same category of “canceled” as these accused celebrities. Although the boycott is sometimes completely justified, people seem to often take it too far or too seriously, not realizing that there is a difference between an artist and their art.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86440\" style=\"width: 296px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86440\" data-attachment-id=\"86440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/art-v-artist/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,1011\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"art v artist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist-185x250.jpg?resize=286%2C386\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow me to drop a mind-blowing fact real quick: celebrities are human too.

Twitter didn’t take a second to breathe and do background research before exploding on Hart for his mistakes. This is where the debate of whether or not art should be viewed as separate from the artist comes in: should Kevin Hart be allowed to perform given his problematic past?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the internet fad of canceling celebrities at the snap of a finger, it was much easier for consumers to draw a line between an artist and their art. In modern society, however, that line is blurred and sometimes nonexistent. Picasso was misogynistic, yet his art is still considered some of the best in the world. William Golding was an attempted rapist, but his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lord of the Flies </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is still taught in high schools across the nation. J.D. Salinger was a pedophile, yet he is considered one of the greatest American authors of all time, and his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Catcher in the Rye </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the most widely-read novels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, consumers of entertainment have decided to take more responsibility for holding celebrities accountable for their actions, but it has gotten to the point where celebrities can’t take a single step out of place without risking everything. I’m in no way condoning the previously mentioned artists’ behavior; I’m just stating that these artists are different from their art and their work, and that their personalities should be considered separately. Supporting an artist’s work is not equivalent to supporting their actions, to a certain extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This line gets a little hazy with artists who haven’t just made small mistakes. On one end of the spectrum of #canceled celebrities are celebrities like Kevin Hart and on the other end are celebrities like Tekashi 6ix9ine, R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. For the latter artists mentioned, it becomes harder to support their work without feeling like you’re condoning their actions. Although there is an extreme difference between Kevin Hart’s eight-year-old homophobic tweets and Bill Cosby’s </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple sexual assault charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both have fallen victim to canceled culture. Making the separation between an artist and their art was definitely easier before the Internet, and although I believe it’s still important, it becomes more difficult with celebrities on the extreme end of the spectrum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a wide range of actions that can make a celebrity fall victim to the hashtag, and what irks me is that no matter where you fall on this spectrum, you get sentenced to #canceled for life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a good middle ground that society can take on this issue is to be more accepting and lenient towards work from artists who have made active efforts to learn from their mistakes and move forward. Let me be clear: this doesn’t apply to the Bill Cosbys or R. Kellys of the world, but it does apply to the Kevin Harts. Kevin Hart has made a public and conscious effort to right his wrongs and move on with his life, and we should not judge his comedy in light of his personal mistakes. We’re putting too much pressure on ourselves as consumers to evaluate what should and shouldn’t be appreciated due to the actions of their creators. Instead, we should appreciate art for what it is, rather than blaming ourselves for “supporting” an artist’s slightly problematic past.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alysha Agarwal urges people to discern between an artist’s actions and their work.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/","id":6281,"author":{"id":383,"name":"Alysha Agarwal"},"related":[6280,6279,6278],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/opinion/virtual-reality","highestPage":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
