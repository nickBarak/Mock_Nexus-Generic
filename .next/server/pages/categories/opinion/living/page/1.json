Unlike most kids running carefree through toy stores, panic paralyzed me as dinnertime, my cue to leave the store, inched closer. Sitting beside me, my dad put his hand on my back as I sat between stuffed animals. Each one had their own backstory, name and future adventure brimming on the horizon, but I could only take one home. For 30 whole minutes, my brain rattled with indecision. My fear of making the wrong choice ignited my anxiety, giving it a life force off of which to feed. Now, in a world flipped upside down by a pandemic, I continue to face tough choices as if I had never left that toy store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, instead of having to choose between two equally cute stuffed animals, now I find myself having to choose between an apartment and my parents’ house. Locked in contracts after what turned out to be a brief flirtation with independence, many college students are continuing to pay their leases while regressing on their parents’ couches. When faced with today’s housing conundrum, having to choose between remaining here or going “home,” I was confronted by the seemingly easy question of how to live. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running through my daydreams, both while I’m in Isla Vista and away, I wonder what really is the right decision. Is it right or selfish to stay in I.V.? At home, my body sinks when I picture the money I’m wasting, but at school, I imagine myself craving family. In truth, neither answer is what’s “right.” After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone all too familiar with indecision, I came up with this list of factors to help me figure out where it’s healthiest for me to live. And most importantly, a way to remember that there is no generic answer for knowing how to live happily and well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is first paramount to prioritize your own mental and physical safety. Families can stick together in a crisis, but that’s not necessarily true for everyone. There are many people who can’t go home because their loved ones are on the front lines, home is unwelcoming or because they have already settled in Santa Barbara. If you have an unstable relationship with your former guardians, going home can hurt more than it can help. In these already difficult times, think about yourself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it’s not selfish to live out your lease if leaving is better for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not for you. In times of trouble, there’s an expectation to gravitate homeward, but deciding to stay in your Isla Vista home, with your Isla Vista family, can be the best choice. Everyone should be with their preferred support system. Your priority should be to get through your assignments without compromising your mental health. Conversely, if staying in Isla Vista would do you more harm than good, then don’t think of leaving as “wasting money.” If your family home is where it’s safest, then don’t hesitate to go. While it’s difficult, carrying guilt over seemingly wasted money shouldn’t be your responsibility right now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also important to remember that money isn’t everything. None of us could have seen this coming. So while it’s easier said than done, don’t beat yourself up about whatever decision you make. The impact of COVID-19 will reshape how all future rent contracts work, but today, we’re already locked into pre-virus clauses. If that money is lost, remember that if the world wasn’t upside down, your I.V. home would be housing you. If the only reason you’re in I.V. is to justify your rent, please know that going home isn’t a defeat. Money will always matter, especially to those without much of it, but you matter as well. It’s better to prioritize your comfort, safety and sanity over saving on rent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing in that vein, trust yourself, no matter what your decision is. Amid this chaos, our lives remain our own. I compare myself to others all of the time. I look at people working more, in different fields or who are learning new skills, and wonder if my differences and lack of success make me less than. Have I made the wrong decisions? Where did I go wrong? Hearing about other people’s living choices during this pandemic has also left me in a state of fear. What do they know that I don’t? I haven’t shut down these thoughts, but I’ve learned to push them to the side, allowing them only to linger softly in the background of my mind like elevator music. We coexist, and in searching for my own confidence, I’ve learned to accept that I’ll never know if what I’m doing is right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being told what to do feels horrible, as if I’ve been deemed incapable. In the end, we are the only people who know, or can guess, what’s best for ourselves. And as such, no one should judge others for whatever living situation they choose. It’s difficult, but after sitting down and thinking about what </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need, listen to what that little voice inside you says. In retrospect, I may regret what I choose, but like with the stuffed animal I left behind, it’s best to remember that we’re all only acting with the information that we have. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Morley is one confused third-year student who wishes everyone the best of health (especially to those on the front lines).</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/","id":5634,"author":{"id":801,"name":"Hannah Morley"},"related":[5633,5632,5631],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"An East Coaster’s Guide To California Winter","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Living","publish_date":"2019-12-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Xmas-in-Ca-e1576061449231.png?resize=650%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Dreaming of a white Christmas, Anabel Costa writes about how East Coast transplants can tap into the holiday spirit.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of year: the local Starbucks is playing Pandora’s Michael Bubl</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> radio station on repeat, Tastemade is coming out with cookie decorating hacks that will inevitably leave you feeling incompetent and a third “A Christmas Prince”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movie has just been released.

So for anyone else who has known the joys of an East Coast winter and is feeling a bit apprehensive about the prospect of a California holiday, here’s a quick guide to help you cope:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While snow is what really makes winter beautiful, it can also be the stuff of nightmares. First of all, shoveling is the absolute worst. It’s genuinely hard work, and sometimes you might find yourself shoveling in the dark and racing against the clock to clear the driveway before the snow freezes. There’s also the dreaded slush, when the snow turns various shades of brown or grey. Even the coveted snow day can turn against you. For instance, one year, for my sixth birthday, there was so much snow that no one could come to my party. So when I find myself biking to class in 75 degree weather in the middle of November, I try to remind myself that not getting to wear a scarf is a small price to pay for not having to deal with these horrors.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, baking is an essential part of winter. When the temperatures outside approached freezing and my parents refused to turn up the thermostat, baking helped warm me up. These days, even if I don’t need to bake to stay warm, a fresh batch of cookies, brownies or apple crisp takes me back to those winter days of yore. If you need a little holiday cheer, throw a cookie decorating party or a gingerbread house-making competition!\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My least favorite part of winter is how early the sun sets. Here in California, we’re still dealing with short days but at least we get sun until close to 5:30 pm. Where I grew up in Massachusetts, the sun sets as early as 4 pm during this time of year. It might not seem like much, but that extra hour certainly makes a difference, and if there’s one thing I can be thankful for this Thanksgiving, it’s that I have one more hour of sunshine every day.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the month of December, keep an eye out for fun and festive events happening nearby. For example, in Santa Barbara, there is an annual </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/waterfront/events/light_parade.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parade of Lights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There will be up to 30 boats this year decorated to the theme of “Deep Space Holidays,” sailing the Santa Barbara coastline. Apparently there will even be 10 tons of snow! There is also the </span><a href=\"https://santabarbaraca.com/events/solvang-julefest/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solvang Julefest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which takes place throughout the entire month of December. There are many other holiday events happening in the area, so if finals week is getting you down, check out some local events for a festive pick-me-up.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to remember during the winter holidays is that it’s about spending time with the ones you love </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whether that means family, friends or the neighbor’s dog. It doesn’t matter whether there’s snow on the ground or what the thermostat says, as long as it’s spent with the people we love. Since moving to California when I was 14, I have been lucky enough to only spend one winter break here. Though I still prefer heading east for the holidays, even though it wasn’t the Christmas I was used to, it was still a fun and happy time because I spent it with family.    </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there you have it: these are some of the things that have helped me through the season until I get to return to my icy home for winter break. Of course, there is nothing wrong with California winters (most probably prefer it); I just can’t seem to get used to the palm trees and snow-less landscapes come November. But wherever you are this holiday season, I hope it delivers on the promise of being the most wonderful time of the year. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes everyone a frosty winter and a happy holidays.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Don’t sit on the curb. </span>I literally can’t repeat this enough.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to avoid walking through Anisq’Oyo Park (the big park in the middle of the loop) by yourself in the dark as there are very few lights along the paths and it is not a very populated area. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of the fact that you go to school in literal paradise; take a walk down to Sands Beach for the most spectacular sunsets or look out for the many public gardens and orchards throughout Isla Vista.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t try fitting more than two people on the electric scooters or try doing any funny stunts — you’ll just look like an idiot. There is also the distinct possibility of one of you cracking your head open as well. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that it’s one mile from one end of Del Playa to the other, so don’t skip leg day in the weeks leading up to Deltopia.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living in I.V. is the best, but only when you are picking the right roommates. There is no need to rush into signing a lease this early in the year. A lot of people will encourage you to sign leases as early as October, but worry not, things always work out. Also, sometimes living with strangers can be one of the best decisions you make!</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Co-op and I.V. Market are great places to swing by in a hangry emergency but don’t rely on them for your everyday grocery shopping. Your college budget will not accommodate it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CAJÉ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is great for grabbing a coffee, smoothie or acai bowl, but if you want a bagel definitely skip and go to Bagel Cafe instead. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s fun to wander around I.V. looking for something to do at night, but most of the time this leads to frustration and/or in-group quarrelling. Save your makeup for an evening with an address. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take care of your fellow Gauchos.

I also knew it would come with some changes — but that was the point. I wanted change. I wanted exposure to new people and new experiences. I had a serious lack of Vitamin D, and I was sick of having conversations with people who thought building the wall was the solution to all of America’s problems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Despite there being too many conservatives, having to scrape ice off of my car everyday before school in the winter and OSU fans dedicating their lives to football (because, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do), I still love Ohio. No matter how much I wanted to leave, and how happy I am to be in sunny and liberal California, nothing ever compares to home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It has also made me turn my head and laugh quite a few times when I see t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he accuracy in my preconceived notions and stereotypes of Californian culture before I moved here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my first day of school, I rode my bike to campus and saw more bikes and skateboards than I’ve ever seen in one place at a time. People don’t skate where I’m from because it’s too cold or rainy, and people don’t bike because there aren’t enough bike paths. We love to drive everywhere — so environmentally conscious! I was a little nervous seeing so many bikes in one place — I even crashed into another bike while attempting to turn into the HSSB — but that’s beside the point. Everyone was in good shape, peddling or skating and making their way to class. Wow — environmentally friendly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> active. Check that off the unconscious list of stereotypes I keep in my head about Californians.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I walked into one of my first lectures, a feminist studies class. My professor started out by asking us what is making us mad in this world where climate change, income inequality, religious conflict and so many other pressing issues drown our hopes for the future. For almost two hours, people raised their hands expressing their fury about our president and the inequalities millions of disadvantaged people face in this wack system that we call America. People are woke here. Another check off of my mental list of Californian stereotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another class, my professor came to lecture with wet hair from a surf sesh he hit right before class and drank green juice. Check. My TA for another class skated to section and wore backwards hats and muscle tees a little too often.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely would not find this in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another new concept that I’ve gotten acquainted with since moving here is astrology. An overwhelming amount of people that I’ve met at UCSB believe in it wholeheartedly. My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.” Or: “You should look at careers that fit your astrological sign. I’m a Gemini and we’re supposed to be really good communicators, so I’m majoring in communication.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time, I even had a Lyft driver who, within the span of 10 minutes, described how his planetary alignment was off because “Mercury was in retrograde,” and because of this, he had been microdosing on shrooms all weekend. This was my ride back to the dorms after going home for winter break. It was the perfect paradoxical transition to being back in California from Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting adjusted to new faces, classes, neighborhoods and scenery, California has become hard not to love. Although my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clichéd </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">image of everyone being a free-spirited hippie and having a good time lounging in the sun has been proven true at times, I can’t dismiss the actual issues that surround millions of people in the state of California</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Wildfires, an infeasible cost of living and racial and income inequality engross the lives of California natives everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is easy to recognize and laugh at all of the stereotypical images people at UCSB have done a wonderful job portraying, it is important to acknowledge what goes on beyond the fantasized idea of living in California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, moving to California has been an eye opening experience, not just in self-discovery, but a deeper look into the world and lives that surround me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Maybe the EDM music, overpriced avocado toast and hot yoga obsession is a little over the top at times, but overall the progressive atmosphere and unique people that I have met has made it easy to adjust to my new home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler thinks that California and UCSB live up to the stereotypes.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/","id":5626,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5625,5624,5623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The “Can Fairies” of Isla Vista","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Living","publish_date":"2019-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0384-e1556160392691.jpg?resize=650%2C412&ssl=1","description":"Thomas Lenihan implores his fellow I.V. residents to face uncomfortable facts.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since last spring I’ve become increasingly convinced that an invisible gymnast has been controlling much of what I see.

Can fairies and students don’t really mix: maybe you nod or flash a tight-lipped smile as you bike to class or walk downtown for a bite to eat, or exchange bilingual pleasantries as you stoop under the beer die table to help them collect the day’s haul of empties. However, chances are that’s the extent of most interactions many of us have had with can fairies.

They would clamor over the crinkling, clinking, crashing mountain of salvaged bottles and cans that occasionally spilled out the back of the van and onto the road. At the time their noisy repose signified nothing; it was just a softer accompaniment to the sounds of trap and laughter, wafting over the tops of eucalyptus trees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d like to think of myself as a fairly empathetic and giving person:  If I saw a friend in need, I’d gladly provide whatever help I could. But I didn’t offer any help to the couple in the van — I didn’t even think twice about it. Ignoring their ongoing struggle with extreme poverty right outside my door, while simultaneously maintaining the lifestyle of an affluent college student, is a sort of paradox, and it would have been crippling to see it for what it was and do nothing. Mental gymnastics makes ignoring your neighbor’s suffering much easier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologists call this paradox cognitive dissonance: the implacable discomfort that occurs whenever our thoughts, opinions or actions don’t fall in line with our values. To relieve ourselves of this dissonance, we must change. We commonly alter either our thoughts or actions to fit with our ideals or vice versa. But, there is another way to rid ourselves of dissonance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Leon Festinger — the psychologist who </span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24936719.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first described</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cognitive dissonance — puts it, to reduce cognitive dissonance “a person… can even distort his perception and his information about the world around him.” If we aren’t seeing things for what they are, then we can still keep our morals intact and go on, business as usual. This distortion is the gymnast’s specialty, and morals are his medium. I can see now that, with the help of my gymnast, I was carefully avoiding my neighbors and their struggles. My gymnast and I twisted, flipped and spun around moral obstacles, performing contortions that from a different perspective could appear improbable or astounding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My gymnast helped me look at  my neighbors without seeing them. We interacted fairly regularly. Most mornings I would shuffle around the back of my house to my bike, still sore from lack of sleep the night before and come face to face with the man rifling through my garbage cans, bag in hand. I’d smile and say hello. He’d flash a nervous greeting from under the brim of his sunhat and that would be that. I never made an effort to get to know him </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fter a year of living so close to each other, I never learned his name. To me he was just another can fairy. A part of the backdrop that is life in I.V.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It begins with a conversation, a real one, with the next person who slips into our backyards to collect our empyies or check your bins for misfiled bottles.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m tired of living with my moral gymnast. I’m tired of avoiding eye contact with people I know deep down could really use someone’s acknowledgement. I’m tired of pretending like I don’t know most can fairies likely make around $40 a day, working sunrise to sunset. I’m tired of not knowing my neighbors’ names and I’m tired of feeling guilty and still doing nothing to change that. It’s too late for me to get to know my old neighbors. I’ve gone back to my old street and looked for them, but their van is gone. Maybe they found a more hospitable place to stay — I certainly hope so. And I hope my struggle to get my gymnast out of my head is a personal one, but I’ve seen too many other people in I.V. vault up and get themselves out of the way of seeing their neighbors to believe that’s the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it’s not all doom and gloom. We Isla Vistans are uniquely poised to evict our moral gymnasts once and for all. I.V. is now a sort of Neverland, toeing the line between reality and myth. We live (to paraphrase Lewis Hyde) in a place halfway between a slum and a library — an island of endless shabby apartments where throngs of shoeless idealists are free to let their imaginations run wild. Isla Vista rests on a lengthy volume of history, much of it fairly unpleasant. From wetland to parking lot, Chumash land to bean farm, open pit mine to proving ground for environmental and social activists — we live in a place that has seen a lot of suffering over the decades and centuries. Yet, it is this history that gives us an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of previous residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our gymnast-aided denial of the existence of can fairies represents a chance to bring the myth of Isla Vista closer to its reality. It begins with a conversation, a real one, with the next person who slips into our backyards to collect our empyies or check your bins for misfiled bottles. What we do to reduce dissonance is ultimately a conscious choice: we can continue to distort, obscure, and contort our perception to avoid facing uncomfortable facts, or we can brush up on those two years of high school Spanish quickly fading from memory and change our actions instead.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Lenihan believes fairies are real.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/the-can-fairies-of-isla-vista/","id":5631,"author":{"id":817,"name":"Thomas Lenihan"},"related":[5630,5629,5628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who Can Partake in Party Culture?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Living","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Laurel Rinehart challenges the assumption that UCSB's party scene is inclusive to all.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos pride themselves on many things, such as having access to the beach at any time, being able to navigate chaotic bike paths and the recent announcement of our spot as the No. 5 public school in the nation.

As opposed to other schools where the parties are exclusively put on by fraternities or athletic organizations, Isla Vista offers a plethora of house parties along the ocean every weekend that are hosted by students in private, unaffiliated residences. This creates a party culture in which anyone, regardless of their involvement with Greek life or athletics, can find a location on a Friday or Saturday night where they will be able to drink and dance the night away. What makes UCSB party culture stand out is not the size or frequency of the gatherings, but its open and inclusive nature.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84100\" style=\"width: 398px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84100\" data-attachment-id=\"84100\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/who-can-partake-in-party-culture/image_123986672-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=1633%2C1563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1633,1563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=888%2C850&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-84100\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=388%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?w=1633&amp;ssl=1 1633w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=768%2C735&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C980&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But is this narrative really true?

Almost every girl wears a full face of makeup and a variation of the standard uniform of high-waisted shorts and a crop top. There is nothing wrong with dressing this way — I myself have a closet full of “hoe clothes” from which I select my outfits every weekend — but it creates a pressure to conform for girls who wish to partake in the party scene but may not be comfortable putting their bodies on display for any number of reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the dress code, the rules for getting into parties are strict and largely based on gender. Conventionally attractive girls are almost guaranteed entry at every door; for male students, however, passage is much more complicated. In accordance with the norms at most other universities, fraternity parties are essentially off-limits for non-members. However, even the supposedly open house parties on DP are very exclusive and typically do not allow male students to enter unless they know the host of the party or are accompanied by a large group of girls. Residents of private homes have the right to allow or deny entry to whomever they choose, and I’m not suggesting that there should be some sort of requirement for parties to be open to every single student. I simply wish to bring attention to the underlying problematic message in the choice of who can and cannot enter: if you are not an attractive, sexually available female, there is no place for you in one of these gatherings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overtly sexual dynamic within parties is another aspect that isolates people who do not wish to partake in the “hookup culture” that has become synonymous with college life. While sexual comments and unwanted groping are the most prevalent at fraternity parties — at least in my experience — these behaviors are still the norm at any party you attend. While partygoers obviously have the option of simply hanging out with their friends and saying “no” to any sexual advances, there is an overwhelming feeling that if you are not open to advances or directly engaging in sexual dancing, you are in the wrong place.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the hookup culture of UCSB parties is overwhelmingly heterosexual. Look around and you will see numerous straight couples grinding or making out on the dance floor, but there do not seem to be spaces where LGBTQ students can express their sexuality so easily. The heteronormative aspect of college party life is often blamed on fraternity culture in think-pieces about American colleges in general; however, this exclusive norm extends beyond Greek life where UCSB is concerned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whiteness is another unspoken requirement for students to feel that they fit in at most house parties. Though I am white and cannot speak personally about minority students’ experiences, I have had conversations with several students of color who expressed feeling uncomfortable in the mostly white party crowd. For whatever reason, the percentage of people of color inside a typical party is even lower than that within UCSB’s predominantly white student body. There is no way of measuring whether this is due to non-white students being turned away at the door or if the dominant culture causes them to avoid parties altogether. Whatever the reason, there is unfortunately a normative racial pattern that makes people of color feel unwelcome or out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all these critiques, I am not saying that parties in Isla Vista should stop altogether or that students should boycott them. It is inevitable that partying will occur as part of the college experience, and no aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality. All I’m asking is for people to direct a more critical eye at the assumption that UCSB is an exception to the typical exclusivity at party schools solely because our parties are not controlled by Greek organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB party culture is the land where everyone is welcome. That is, everyone who fits the standards of both appearance and behavior for the perfect partygoer: white, in impeccable shape, heterosexual and willing to flirt and dance with strangers. We need to promote a new paradigm in which the diversity that UCSB claims to celebrate is actually present within its famous party scene.</span></p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart wants you to question your perceptions of the party scene.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

The privacy of Facebook Messenger provides an interaction not unlike a silent auction: anonymous bids that push the limit to an object’s worth. A community like ours has a diverse range of socioeconomic brackets and OBO is, theoretically, a wonderful way to engage many potential buyers of varying willingness to pay with an enticing low starting price. In a stroke of serendipity, OBO works brilliantly for the online flea market that is Free &amp; For Sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While OBO has proven its practicality for Brandy Melville tube tops and seven-year-old IKEA night stands, it is inherently unethical to surge pricing on Rideshare. To me, Rideshare is about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (surprise). It’s a relatively safe way of offering your neighbor a much-appreciated seat, it’s a kind nod to the environment as you switch left to the carpool lane, but most of all, it’s a conscious act of empathy. One could have driven alone and enjoyed a few hours of mindless podcasting, but instead chose the extra hassle of picking up and dropping off people who were on their way to music festivals, long distance relationships or families. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for a ride, people chip in for gas money (although not always required), light conversation and sometimes snacks. Gas money is a fair expectation for the driver, and I support this system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a recent trip home, my roommate came back to report that a trip from Isla Vista to Los Altos could cost up to $35, with some drivers auctioning off the seats to the best offer. It was no longer a first-come, first-serve basis that operated without a discriminatory barrier to entry. Drivers who see the opportunity to make the same type of ticket sales will follow in suit. Some people simply could not afford such a ride with those drivers, and in this particular example of broken capitalism, personal gain again trumps social responsibility.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Rideshare is not a tank top, it is not a coffee table, it is not a discounted eyelash extension service. It is a helping hand, a generous deed that is returned graciously with a thankful Venmo payment or a couple of crumpled tens. I’ve had pleasant experiences with Rideshare: incredibly kind people who didn’t make me sit in the middle seat, who charged at most $25 and told me about their art project for Art 7A. They take extra precaution to drive without alarming their passengers and either already know the way or have a navigation system in place. Sometimes gum will be offered; occasionally an aux cord will be tossed into your lap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my friend Jessica said in a moment of reflection, “Rideshare drivers are the unregulated oligopolists of the Free &amp; For Sale world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a girl picked me up in her seven-seater on my way home to the East Bay, she arranged the seating meticulously. He sits here, she sits there. It finally made sense when the girl who “agreed to sit in the seat without the seatbelt” showed up for her spot in the middle row. We paid $35 one way regardless of drop-off location as she made her way to Sacramento. The driver drove at 90 miles per hour while she navigated from an iPad in the middle console, checked texts and even picked up a phone call with one hand on the way there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, it was my decision to opt for a five-hour ride in her van instead of a 10-hour journey on Amtrak, but was it fair to ask for gas money when you could not ensure the safety of your passengers? Using GasBuddy, I calculated that her 2002 Chevy Suburban, driving 388 miles from Isla Vista to Sacramento, would cost around $78.44 for 31 gallons. I’m using GasBuddy, which gives idealistically low gas prices, so let’s say that she got unlucky with some gas station on the way, and that it cost her an even Benjamin Franklin.
