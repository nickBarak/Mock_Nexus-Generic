I had thought I could use my voice to incite change regarding this issue. Now, only two days later, 17 more kids exactly like me, high school students filled with optimism for the future, had lost their lives to a senseless act of gun violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The epidemic of gun violence is no secret to the community of Isla Vista, as four years prior, the Isla Vista tragedy left an enormous mark on our college town. The United States has had </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">57 times as many school shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as other industrial nations combined and in 2017, had the 28th highest rate of death from gun violence </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/11/09/666209430/deaths-from-gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-with-the-rest-of-the-world\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. American students of all ages live in rational fear of gun violence, and yet very little has changed to protect them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2020 was the </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-first-march-without-school-shooting-since-2002-united-states/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first March in nearly two decades without a school shooting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the United States, not because of groundbreaking gun control legislation, but assumedly because of campus closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Simply shutting down schools seems to be the only way to prevent further shootings, as government regulation of firearms has been historically inefficient in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the rate of mass public shootings have fallen, the pandemic has brought on its own host of gun-related problems. Recent state-wide lockdowns have required the closure of all nonessential businesses. Those businesses that are allowed to stay open provide essential items such as groceries, gasoline and medical care. Recently, businesses that sell firearms have manipulated their way onto that list. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many states originally ordered firearms businesses to close but immediately reversed their initial orders after being slapped with </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/buckling-pressure-many-states-deem-gun-stores-essential-allow-them-n1177706\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple lawsuits by gun rights advocates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The threat of widespread litigation combined with </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-stores-ruled-essential-businesses-during-coronavirus-shutdowns-11585601189\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense lobbying by gun-industry groups</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> led the federal government to officially advise states to categorize gun stores, gun manufacturers, and shooting ranges as critical businesses allowed to remain open during the stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, allowing firearm businesses to remain open has only exacerbated an environment of fear-mongering and violence during an already stressful time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of pandemic panic, firearm and ammunition sales have skyrocketed. Over the past few weeks, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjjohnsonjr/status/1238868541689880576\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long lines of customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could even be seen stretching out of the doors of some Los Angeles gun stores. Store owners are attributing this </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-gun-buyers.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 to 40% spike in sales</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entirely to the virus scare and are now typically selling as many as 300 firearms a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But guns will not make Americans any safer in the face of COVID-19. In fact, these panic-fueled purchases are just inciting more violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overall crime has declined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the pandemic, </span><a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2020/05/21/pandemic-quieted-public-shootings-but-not-gun-violence-arizona-westgate/5238089002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gun violence has not</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Gun violence has disproportionately impacted communities of color due to historic racism surrounding housing, education and employment. These are now some of the communities </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-us-surgeon-general-jerome-adams-covid-19-disproportionate-impact-black-america/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hit hardest by the coronavirus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, creating an feasible environment for responsive gun violence to occur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Chicago, the police department has reported </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a double-digit increase in gun incidents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to this time last year. Similarly, Philadelphia is seeing a </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-gun-violence-double-public-health-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% increase in homicide shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to last year. Many city leaders fear that, with increased possession of firearms and ammunition, the number of shootings may only increase further once lockdowns are lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidental shootings due to new possession of firearms are also on the rise. In Albuquerque, a man was arrested for </span><a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1434623/man-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-13-yr-old-cousin.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accidentally shooting and killing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his 13-year-old cousin. He told detectives that he was arming himself for protection amidst the coronavirus scare and hadn’t realized that his shotgun was loaded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, this influx in gun sales may be contributing to a decline in home safety. In Houston, </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-domestic-violence-victims-stay-at-home-orders-do-not-offer-safety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">domestic violence calls have increased by 6%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the month of March and were up by 21% percent in Phoenix. This trend is reverberating throughout the nation, as </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay-at-home orders are proving to be a danger for domestic violence victims, which is only exacerbated by the presence of a gun in the home. In Pennsylvania, a man reportedly </span><a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-latest-roderick-bliss-shoots-longtime-girlfriend-kills-self-after-being-extremely-upset-about-pandemic-losing-job-wilson-police-say/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot his girlfriend and then himself</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after losing his job due to the pandemic. Incidents like these, in which family members are the target of gun violence, are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, firearms have become a symbol of apocalyptic panic in this pandemic. Gun-toting protesters have flocked to state legislatures, in clear defiance of stay-at-home orders. It didn’t take long for </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michigan-capitol-protests-lockdown-stay-at-home-vote-armed-bulletproof-vest-a9493306.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pictures of these angry demonstrators</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> armed with assault rifles and screaming at politicians in bulletproof vests to circulate through social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing firearm businesses to remain open during this already high-strung period has ultimately produced more panic and fueled more violence than what previously existed. The fact that Americans believe that buying guns is a logical form of protection from this pandemic clearly indicates the growth of this mass hysteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increase in violence, if anything, should highlight the importance of gun control legislation. Now, exactly six years since the Isla Vista tragedy sparked activism in our own Santa Barbara community, gun violence remains as prevalent an issue as ever. For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Kocis rejects the labeling of firearms businesses as essential and pushes for greater gun control legislation.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

When Sanders ended his campaign, it was unlikely that he could have taken the nomination, being that he was so far behind Biden in the vote count. Sanders has maintained similar stances through both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, which many considered far too “radical.” Undoubtedly, many Democrats were fearful that in the general election, voters would be hesitant to embrace his ideas. On the other hand, Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is a far more moderate candidate, making him an appealing choice for a wider range of voters and the Democratic National Committee itself. Consequently, some Sanders supporters are reluctant to grant their vote to Biden. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders’ demographic is primarily young people, many of whom have taken to the internet to express their frustration in the wake of his decision. They have coined the phrase “Bernie or Bust” to express their refusal to vote for Biden in the general presidential election. Some of these supporters have stated that they will not be voting in the election at all, or that they will be writing Sanders on the ballot instead.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I stand for Sanders’ positions, this is an irresponsible use of one’s right to vote. Once again, we find ourselves set to watch a battle between two nonoptimal old white men. The position we have been put in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> forced to choose the lesser of two evils </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far from ideal.

This is not a swing state, and because of the electoral college, it can be assumed that California will go to whoever the Democratic nominee is. However, your vote is still needed. Safe states haven’t always been safe states: The position of the state either changes or stays the same through the votes of individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2016 election, we saw a battle between the popular vote and the electoral college. The people chose Clinton, and the system chose Donald Trump. This is definitely a testament to the corruption inherent in our system. Without the quantity of individual voters, this corruption wouldn’t have been exposed. More so, if you don’t go to the polls in November, your vote for local positions and propositions will also go unconsidered. If anything, you should feel a stronger desire to vote in local elections, as the outcome of these elections will impact you more directly. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Sanders’ announcement, Biden took to the stage and addressed Sanders supporters. </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He assured us,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.” This may seem unconvincing to many of us, but Sanders himself has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-endorsement.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his former competitor. In a joint livestream appearance, he said to Biden, “We need you in the White House. And I will do all that I can to see that that happens.” Following Sanders’ endorsement came the endorsements of former President Barack Obama and previous candidate Elizabeth Warren. The fact that these figures have turned their support toward Biden enhances the importance of our support to Biden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, I find a “blue no matter who” mindset to be an ignorant one. There is much more to consider about a candidate than simply the political party they identify with. It is important to research candidates and be clear about their stance on different issues. Just because someone identifies with a certain party doesn’t mean that their views or voting record align with said party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what I</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want to stress is the importance of your vote. A vote for Biden is not only that, but it is also a vote against Trump. Many of us believe that Trump’s position in the White House has been a major step in the wrong direction for our country. Sanders’ proposals of Medicare for All, cancellation of college debt and the Green New Deal gave us hope for the future. We must continue to fight for these progressive causes. While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biden’s campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prioritizes healthcare, environmental issues and the economy. He proposes to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower the age of eligibility for Medicare. As for the environmental crisis, Biden promises that he will lead our country toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Biden favors an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and an overall strengthening of support for the middle working class. Comparatively, </span><a href=\"https://www.promiseskept.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been working to repeal Obamacare, leading to an increasing number of uninsured Americans. He has pulled our country out of the Paris Climate Agreement, with the intent to continue drilling and rescind the Clean Power Plan. Trump has decreased unemployment, which still stands high, but tax cuts for the upper class have affected the country elsewhere </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example, bringing about the increase in uninsured Americans. Trump has prioritized the 1%. Biden’s policies are not as progressive as Sanders’. They are, however, monumentally better than Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We needn’t give up on the things that Sanders promised us; we can continue to strive for the implementation of those policies.

changed from an abstract entity to our new national reality. With the public health crisis gaining status as a pandemic, and more and more cases of those infected with the virus emerging both in the U.S. and abroad, this is a catastrophe that no one has ever experienced in their lifetime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such bleak times, it is natural that a nation would look towards its leader for guidance. Unfortunately for the U.S., Donald Trump has mismanaged this crisis from the outset. Although it appears that he is finally starting to grasp the severity of it, his initial denial and spread of misinformation has only made things worse. His poor leadership abilities have failed the U.S. in a time when it needs a strong president most. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus was on anyone’s radar, Trump’s history as president has been problematic in terms of his efforts to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21150574/trump-coronavirus-cdc-cuts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">curb preemptive measures</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> designed to deal with pandemics such as this one. In 2005, the U.S. Agency for International Development </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created a program </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">called “Predict” to help identify and research emerging infectious diseases in animals so that the nation could be better prepared for an outbreak. This program continued through both the Bush and Obama administrations, but the Trump administration shut it down in October 2019. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, the Trump administration fired </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5806558/administration-officials-fight-criticism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the entire pandemic response team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that would have greatly aided the nation during this crisis.

He has referred to the coronavirus as </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“fake news,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his trademark dismissal for all events that don’t align with his agenda. Trump has also </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Democrats’ criticism of his response to coronavirus is a“hoax” that was created to hurt Trump’s 2020 political campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s utter dismissal of the threat of coronavirus demonstrates his thorough lack of preparation and education on the subject. Even when he was later asked if he regretted his word choice, Trump said no. He claimed that he was proving he was capable of handling the Democratic “hoax” because his administration is doing </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“such a good job” </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of handling the virus. This is simply not true, as the Trump administration has consistently fumbled its attempts to contain the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late February 2020, the U.S. government had to decide if 14 individuals from the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who had tested positive for coronavirus should be flown home from Japan with a group of over 300 healthy individuals. The CDC strongly advised against this explaining that the infected individuals could easily spread the disease to healthy passengers. The US government decided to ignore this warning. Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-was-not-told-coronavirus-infected-americans-would-be-flown-home-from-cruise-ship/2020/02/21/ae58b24c-54be-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the fact that he was not aware of the government’s decision to do so, which is hard to believe. Even if that were true, that he would be so unaware of such an important decision is a blaring display of his incompetence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s portrayal of coronavirus as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-200323102618665.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“China Virus”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is racist. Trump is so worried about getting blamed for mismanaging the virus that he has resorted to pointing fingers elsewhere, carelessly fueling racial tensions in the process. We as a nation have unfortunately gotten used to Trump’s nonsensical rants, but this is especially unacceptable when time is of the essence and the country is in a state of full-fledged panic. We need a leader, not someone who is out to serve his own interests. Instead of guiding the U.S. through these trying times, Trump is putting Asian Americans at risk for hate crimes because he is so intent on deflecting blame. At the end of the day, this is an egotistical and self-serving approach because it does little to address the real problem and will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can truly see the extent of Trump’s failings by looking at how other leaders are handling the situation. For example, South Korea has also experienced a significant number of outbreaks, but their </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/17/south-koreas-coronavirus-success-story-underscores-how-us-initially-failed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was prompt and aggressive, unlike that of the US. The South Korean government made testing readily available in order to determine the number of cases and isolate those who were infected for treatment. The South Korean government was also more transparent with the information they presented to the public, with the effect of decreasing feelings of panic. As a result of these measures, South Korea has managed to </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow the rate of infection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Testing in the U.S., on the other hand, has been more of a reactionary measure than the preventative one it should be and is </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still not widely available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by any means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, Trump’s ineffectiveness in dealing with the coronavirus is having — and will continue to have — dire consequences. The worst-case scenario for the US is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-projections-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.2 million deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an overwhelming amount of people lacking medical care due to a shortage of  hospital beds and doctors being forced to make heartbreaking decisions in terms of who to provide treatment to. The need for all these restrictions, including school closures and lockdowns, is to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“flatten the curve”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible. Our healthcare system does not have infinite resources and we need to be careful not to overload it. It’s also necessary that we try to make supplies last longer, even if that results in a longer battle against the virus. We need only buy as many resources as necessary while making sure that our neighbors also have equal access to them. Now is not the time to let panic take control and for us to hoard essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is easy to get distracted by the problematic nature of Trump’s leadership, we as citizens must do our part to prevent the virus from spreading. These restrictions are a hassle. Being asked to abruptly move out of Isla Vista and transition into online classes are huge disappointments, especially for graduating seniors. Unfortunately, this is a developing situation and one we must adapt to by practicing effective social distancing and good hygiene. Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election. It will provide an opportunity for the American people to condemn Trump for the despicable way he is handling this crisis while using their vote to select a better leader for the future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop is dismayed by Trump’s ineffectual and racist handling of coronavirus and urges individuals to do their best to help contain it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

Bob Nelson, a candidate for the Fourth District seat on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and former chief of staff for the current Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam, </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has also received funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from oil interests. This district includes Orcutt, Lompoc, a southern segment of Santa Maria and part of the Los Alamos Valley. Currently running unopposed, Nelson has also been </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Porter’s benefactors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In turn, Porter for 2020 has </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributed money and lawn signs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Nelson’s campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though he has received comparatively less contributions than Porter, Nelson has also received funding from multiple smaller, local oil figureheads. Most of </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come from real estate or housing development LLCs but many of these have ties to the oil industry. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Los-Angeles/burton-mesa-holdings-llc/67194667.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burton Mesa Holdings, LLC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has contributed $5000 to Nelson’s campaign, is led by Kenneth Hunter, who is also the president of </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0703841D:US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaquero Energy Inc.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a local oil and gas company. Kenai Drilling, another donor to Nelson’s 2020 campaign, is a local drilling company based locally in Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The company is owned by Tim Crist, who donated to Nelson’s campaign in his own name. Kenai is one of the</span><a href=\"http://www.kenaidrilling.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> largest drilling contractors in the state of California</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rigs available to conduct oil, gas and geothermal drilling on land as well as offshore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 3 we have a choice: to vote for a candidate whose policies are inextricable from the interests of the oil companies or vote for a Board of Supervisors that will stand up to Big Oil. Regardless of political orientation or party membership, a candidate’s funding says a lot about their values and so these facts matter. Afterall, climate change is a bipartisan issue and will affect us all. Here in </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are already experiencing the effects of the climate crisis. This is why it is critical that we take action to elect local representatives who take the climate crisis seriously. Electing officials who are not influenced by oil money is one big step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheina Crystal, Kayla Gorman and Miranda O’Brien encourage students to look into where candidates are receiving their funding.

I scan the menu, knowing what I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> order, but I’m nevertheless tempted by the forbidden fruit: beef. “Don’t get the meat,” I say to myself. “You know it takes 660 gallons of water to produce one hamburger.” Sometimes, I stay strong and get a grilled cheese sandwich. But other times I think </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the hamburger has already been made, so what does it matter whether or not I eat it?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This voice in my head is the voice of cynicism.

Many people can’t help but be plagued by the idea that they are just one person, and, in the grand scheme of things, it’s hard to believe that one person can make a difference. And that’s exactly it: One person can’t make a difference. That’s why it has to be all of us. If everyone thinks, “I’m just one person, I can’t make a difference,” then nothing will ever get done. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everyone thinks, “I’m just one person, I can’t make a difference,” then nothing will ever get done. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the thing: It’s not completely our fault that we feel this way. Most news and media outlets aren’t reporting politics in a cut-and-dry way. Instead, they use something called </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=186&amp;v=UpqFaf8vQfk&amp;feature=emb_title\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tactical framing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An example of this is the coverage of the Green New Deal. Essentially, it is the practice of framing news stories around how the Green New Deal divides the Democratic party or how Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump feel about it. What the news doesn’t say is what the Green New Deal actually is, or why we need it. </span><a href=\"https://networks.h-net.org/node/11470/reviews/11612/bateman-cappella-and-jamieson-spiral-cynicism-press-and-public-good\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has written an entire book on how this type of news framing makes the public cynical. When the news focuses on strategy over substance, people are less informed on the facts. I didn’t even know what the Green New Deal was for a while. What I did know was that the GOP hated it and that it would never pass. Tactical framing often produces a negative effect by pitting people against each other and encouraging partisanship.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of action. When we feel like what we do doesn’t matter, we don’t bother taking action. I know so many people who don’t care to vote because “one vote won’t make a difference.” One vote does make a difference, because one individual vote becomes 10 votes, and 10 votes becomes 100, which becomes 1,000, which becomes 10,000 and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of progress. If everyone decides not to act because their vote doesn’t matter, or that abstaining from eating a hamburger won’t make a difference, then we can never move forward as a society. Take the climate crisis as an example. This might be the biggest issue facing our generation. The climate crisis means I might not be able to have children with the knowledge that they won’t live through an extinction. What types of things do we have to do to mitigate this crisis? Drive less, fly less, shop less, eat less meat and have fewer kids, among other things. But who cares if I drive downtown instead of taking the bus when everyone else is driving too?  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things can get better, but we need to act now.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s true </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to make a real difference, everyone has to take these steps individually, and there’s no time to be cynical.

I don’t want these facts to scare anyone into submission: Things can get better, but we need to act now.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most important things we can do as citizens is be politically active. Super Tuesday is on March 3 this year, and the participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. It is the single most important voting day in the presidential primary. On Super Tuesday, the greatest number of delegates will be voting, meaning that more delegates can be won on March 3 than on any other day in the primary.

sides of the same coin due to their similar policy stances. While these two candidates may seem one and the same, certain defining values play an important role in distinguishing between them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upholds the ideals of a democratic socialist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while Warren </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-vows-to-remake-capitalism-businesses-are-bracing-11570643931\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands by capitalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a well-regulated economy. Sanders defends the notion that the current economic structure is “rigged” and must be abolished completely in order to establish a government that reinvents justice. Senator Warren embraces policies of change to the current system, and offers a remedy in her economic patriotism agenda. She pledges a commitment to fundamentally change the government’s approach to the economy, by placing American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of large corporations and Wall Street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As exhibited by their policies, Sanders and Warren represent two vastly different approaches to changing the injustices present in the American system of government. The leftist stance that Sanders presents is founded on the notion that the United States must abolish the system that enables economic disparities, while Warren seeks to reform the system from the inside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One issue that is at the forefront of this election is the student debt crisis affecting 44.7 million Americans, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/student-loan-statistics-2019-n997836\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $1.5 trillion dollars of student debt in the United States is an issue that the Democratic party pledges to eradicate. However, Senators Sanders and Warren offer varying remedies that demonstrate the divisions between their idealistic and realistic approaches, respectively.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Sanders </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/24/bernie-sanders-student-loan-debt-proposal/1544864001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to relieve all student debt by raising money through a Wall Street tax that would add fees to the sale and trade of bonds and stocks. This ambitious effort benefits people of all classes, but asks the government to raise vast amounts of money through means of taxation. This unrealistic plan fails to earn enough revenue to support this initiative, and stands to affect middle class workers. While the tax is aimed at Wall Street investor offices, the debt would fall upon investors themselves when making a transaction. This would discourage trading and hinder the capitalist opportunities that this country is powered by. Senator Sanders proposes high aspirations that in theory would help shape the country. However, these methods of funding fail to meet the demands his programs call for. A sensible candidate such as Warren recognizes the practical approach that must be taken in order to enact real change in the government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Warren, on the other hand, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/elizabeth-warrens-student-debt-bill-would-help-45-million-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presents an initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to focus on students who come from lower income households. Her plan proposes to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for every individual with an income under $100,000. For those with an annual income between $100,000 and $250,000, she promises substantial debt reduction. Warren plans to fund her program with a “wealth tax,” which levies a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, and a 3% tax on individuals who have more than $50 million. Her objective allows for a more affordable plan than the one Senator Sanders advocates for. The Vermont senator’s bill would </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost the government $2.2 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the course of 10 years, while Warren’s would only </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/06/27/how-do-warrens-and-sanders-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-compare/#4a1150de18c4%5D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost $1.25 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the same timespan. This approach to the higher education crisis in the United States demonstrates the dream-like idealism characterizing Senator Sanders’ policies. Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren not only seeks a more practical approach to politics, but she has demonstrated with her extensive track record the effort it takes to successfully implement one’s policies in a bipartisan government. A good indicator of a politician’s potential for presidential success is their </span><a href=\"https://qz.com/1560188/what-the-2020-democratic-candidates-did-in-congress/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ability to pass bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while serving in the House or Senate. During the 2017-2019 congressional terms, when both the House and Senate were controlled by the Republican party for a year, Warren introduced five bills that passed in both houses. Senator Sanders was unable to pass any bills. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren embodies a candidate that can decisively enact her policy reforms and bring about change to the political system. She </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands by</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> abolishing capital punishment and private prisons; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour; free college education and Medicare For All. She is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/31/warrens-agenda-break-up-monopolies-give-workers-control-over-corporations-fight-big-pharma/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">committed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to investigating large corporations and their leaders, and taxing the wealthy to support welfare programs for all.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. Issues in governmental law cannot be solved by just one bill or proposal of change. In order to eradicate the major crises affecting the country today, the United States needs a leader with a clear head who possesses the ability to negotiate with the opposition. Radicalism only goes so far as its opponents will allow, and with a Republican majority still existing in the Senate, it is difficult for mass reform movements to mobilize. Slow and steady wins the race, and Senator Warren plans to enact reform through the strategy of cooperation in order to avoid facing large roadblocks that will result in political gridlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both politicians are leaders of progressive reform; however, Warren has not embraced Democratic socialism to the extent that Senator Sanders has. She promises to stand for compromise and uphold the values of a free market in the United States. It is time for a woman to fulfill the role of the President of the United States and carry her message to the White House.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Rubin strongly advocates the election of Elizabeth Warren to the White House. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BC6701CC-F449-4582-8D3F-5D62CB407529-Sara-Rubin.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sara Rubin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sara Rubin is an Opinion staff writer and Political Science major.

Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years in prison, combining to a total possible sentence of 170 years. The information to which these charges refer is related to the Afghanistan War, the Iraq War and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, as well as U.S. diplomatic cables dating from 1966 to 2011.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/julian-assange-indicted-on-18-federal-charges-related-to-wikileaks-release-of-chelsea-manning-docs-today-2019-05-23/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to G. Zachary Terwilliger</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the U.S. attorney serving as supervisor of the prosecution, the espionage charges are rooted in Assange’s “alleged complicity in illegal acts to obtain or receive voluminous databases of classified information.” He explained, “The United States has not charged Assange for passively obtaining or receiving classified information.” While this may seem innocuous, “complicity” as used here refers to the willfully illegal solicitation and distribution of classified information. This use of “complicity” effectively criminalizes investigative journalists for investigating national security issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prosecution intends to use the first charge  — conspiracy to receive national defense information — to evade this criticism. If this charge sticks, it will open the door for conviction on the other 16.

If they had, they may have been compelled to charge co-publishers of the classified material, like the New York Times, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">El País</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, The Guardian, Le Monde and Der Spiegel for consistency’s sake. The Trump administration has apparently drawn this line and decided to call it conspiracy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To argue that seeking out relevant classified documents constitutes conspiratorial espionage would violate the First Amendment. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspiracy is </span><a href=\"https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=310\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when people work together by agreement to commit an illegal act.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thus, the prosecution must argue for the illegality of </span><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/julian-assange-chelsea-manning-intertwined/story?id=62344376\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assange’s interactions with Chelsea Manning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while maintaining the legality of traditional journalist-whistleblower relationships. The crux of the case is Assange and WikiLeaks’ public and private solicitation of classified material. The idea is that this solicitation encouraged Manning to illegally disclose material, making both culpable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crucially, the prosecution fails to provide a clear definition of solicitation. Might a page on a news organization’s site dedicated to whistleblowers, like that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/tips\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/source/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Intercept</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be considered solicitation? One of the references the prosecutors cite is</span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091104212937/http:/wikileaks.org/wiki/Draft:The_Most_Wanted_Leaks_of_2009\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WikiLeaks’ “Most Wanted Leaks of 2009”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> list, an open-source document which lists specific files of interest. Some of these files are classified. The prosecutors might then consider criminal solicitation to include the listing of specific classified documents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this is still concerning. Suppose there was reason to suspect illicit activity in a government program. The responsibility of a free press is to seek out this material. Publishers do, and should, solicit and publish material of interest, whether it is classified or not. To argue that seeking out relevant classified documents constitutes conspiratorial espionage would violate the First Amendment. </span></p>\n<p>Beyond public solicitation, the prosecutors cite private communications between Assange and Manning where Assange expressed interest in further leaks. By emphasizing his awareness that Manning’s sharing was illegal, the prosecutors intend to indicate his complicity. However, calling this conspiratorial solicitation is problematic for the same reasons as above. The press isn’t legally obligated to respect a document’s confidentiality, particularly when the document concerns the public interest. Sometimes, confidentiality is appropriate and the content shouldn’t be communicated. Other times, there might be a moral obligation to do the opposite. In this instance, one of the things Assange and Manning communicated to the public was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1582304895038000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhnQCGIut-Ryya9Zg670L_Co-54A\">15,000 unreported civilian deaths in Iraq</a>. Perhaps in exposing such information, Assange and Manning were fulfilling an important social function as journalist and whistleblower.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This use of “complicity” effectively criminalizes investigative journalists for investigating national security issues.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WikiLeaks’ solicitation only differs from that of other media organizations by its degree. Criminalizing its actions criminalizes constitutionally protected speech and endangers other publishers, as they operate within the same category. If the prosecution fails to convict Assange on the conspiracy charge, they cannot convict him on the obtaining and disclosing charges either. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may reject my arguments here by stating that Assange isn’t a journalist or politically neutral. This is a good point because the First Amendment only applies to impartial, licensed journalists. John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/1131663755161591808/photo/1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">elaborates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “Julian Assange is no journalist. This is made plain by the totality of his conduct as alleged in the indictment. His conspiring with and assisting a security clearance holder to acquire classified information, and his publishing the names of human sources.” With “conspiring” understood as solicitation and “assisting a security clearance holder” understood as attempting to support someone who is concerned for her own safety, the reference to Assange’s lack of redaction does raise an important issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">In publishing some of the Iraq and Afghanistan War documents, Assange’s transparency led to the release of the names of civilian informants, endangering them to possible retribution.

To examine the limitations of the First Amendment, inspecting the concept of freedom of speech is a good place to start. The First Amendment does not allow individuals to say whatever they want, whenever they want. The classic example that is often taught in high school settings is the metaphor of “shouting fire in a crowded theater.” Originating from the 1919 Supreme Court case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schenck v. United States</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “clear and present danger” test prohibits the </span><a href=\"https://lawshelf.com/videos/entry/freedom-of-speech-exceptions-categories-of-speech-not-protected\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incitement of “imminent lawless action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” Additionally, there are </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight other</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> types of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, including obscenity, solicitations to commit crimes, blackmail, true threats, perjury, child pornography, fighting words and defamation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the First Amendment does prevent Congress from limiting one’s freedom of speech, it doesn’t guarantee freedom from consequences — especially from private entities. In the ever-growing age of social media, employers can easily monitor an employee’s behavior off the clock. There have been </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">numerous instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of employees being fired for tweets or public comments they have made. In 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16110696/firing-google-ceo-employee-penned-controversial-memo-on-women-has-violated-its-code-of-conduct\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google fired an employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made a controversial memo that claimed “women had biological issues that prevented them from being as successful as men in tech.” This event demonstrates how the First Amendment’s freedom of speech does not protect citizens from the consequences of expressing their views. </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lata Nott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the executive director of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, makes the point that “it’s the company’s right to discipline their employees’ speech.” This right only applies to private companies, such as in the Google case above. While it may seem like firing an employee over their views infringes on their freedom of speech, the First Amendment has no jurisdiction here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the concept of freedom under the First Amendment may sound universally appealing, its power has been misconstrued, used to discriminate and infringe on the rights of others. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the First Amendment does not protect against being banned on a social media platform. In 2018, Alex Jones, host of the infamous InfoWars, had </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645352618/twitter-bans-alex-jones-and-infowars-cites-abusive-behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his Twitter account permanently suspended</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This led to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, that tech companies were attempting to suppress conservatives online. Despite Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yelling that the United States has freedom of speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment does not protect against this type of action by private companies. The First Amendment prohibits censorship by the government </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— but</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not by private organizations. To be clear, I am not arguing about the ethics of censorship; I am making the argument that these companies have a right to bar and add consequences to certain speech. Proclaiming that such actions violate the First Amendment and one’s freedom of speech are inaccurate statements that misconstrue the actual meaning of the amendment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect of the First Amendment is the freedom of religion. The amendment states that the government cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/your-right-religious-freedom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Civil Liberties Union</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment prevents the government from establishing or promoting religion in any way and gives individuals the right to worship or not worship as they choose, without punishment. Although this clause in the First Amendment is important, its intent and actual protections have been misconstrued. Religious freedom does not protect one from infringing on others’ rights. Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place. Prior to the civil rights era, racial segregationists justified their actions through scripture and religion. Segregationists argued that black people were inferior to white people, referring to their interpretations of the Bible. This appropriation of the Bible thus legally allowed segregationists to claim that hiring black people would violate their religious beliefs. These legal arguments based on religion would not hold today; however, back then, there were no legal protections for marginalized groups. With the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is now official legal framework that denies discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In more recent events, the First Amendment’s assurance of religious freedom has been misconstrued by individuals to justify discrimination against marginalized groups; these actions often go against different pieces of federal legislation, turning the words “religious freedom” into a buzzword. For example, in 2015, Kim Davis garnered national notoriety for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even after the legalization of gay marriage through </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obergefell v. Hodges</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite the legalization, Davis refused to comply and claimed her right to religious freedom by saying that she made the decision “</span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/01/436557085/despite-high-court-ruling-kentucky-clerk-denies-gay-marriage-licences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under God’s authority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This claim is not only misrepresentative of what religious freedom actually is but also uses the buzzword to discriminate.

The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is an important amendment to pass because it establishes a crucial precedent that will firmly state in the Constitution that discrimination on the basis of sex is not allowed. As of now, the only aspect of the Constitution that even moderately represents an argument for equal rights is the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment. However, the clause does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. The ERA also goes beyond women’s rights because it also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity. Adding the ERA to the Constitution would be meaningful for both women and the LGBTQ+ community. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92125\" style=\"width: 468px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92125\" data-attachment-id=\"92125\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/there-should-be-no-expiration-date-on-ending-sex-discrimination/era-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=650%2C770&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ERA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=864%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-92125\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?resize=458%2C543\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"543\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virginia ultimately ratified the Amendment last </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2020/01/15/0475d51a-36f1-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Jan. 15, and became the 38th and final state needed for the ERA to achieve the approval it needs in order to become an addition to the Constitution.

Unfortunately, over the years, the issue of combatting sex discrimination has become more of a partisan issue.

His appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was perceived by many as Trump’s approval of the despicable manner in which Kavanaugh took advantage of and abused women. Additionally, Trump has attacked women’s reproductive rights through the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/communities/planned-parenthood-global/end-global-gag-rule\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Gag Rule,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is a measure that prohibits any government-funded women’s health clinic from discussing safe abortion practices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women deserve to be seen as equal rather than inferior. The United States needs to move away from its history of outdated social hierarchy and address the lack of equality plaguing its society. On a purely ethical level, it is deplorable that a woman in 2020 is still paid less than a man, does not have the ability to make her own decisions about her reproductive health, and is subject to blatant sex discrimination through no fault of her own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ERA is by no means a magic button that will automatically erase the systemic discrimination that has become a centuries-old practice in this country.

And of course, there is no doubt that our dog is very well-loved by our house. However, I never really considered the ethics of having a dog in student </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housing before this incident. Initially, I was disgusted and irritated at the dog for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">daring to do his business in the house. But as the initial horror faded, I realized that this act was symbolic of a broader question. The poo became a metaphor for all the things that our dog was being denied: unlimited exercise, freedom and the outdoors. However, I don’t know if the dog, or my housemates, saw it like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owning a pet requires committed emotional, physical and even economic support, which seems out of depth for most college students.

Is owning a dog ethically acceptable when most places in Isla Vista don’t have a garden for their pupper to roam free? While the beach and the parks are options, how often do these dogs actually get to go out? The daily responsibilities of having a dog means that you can’t afford to sleep in until 2 p.m. It can restrict students’ ability to travel and work during and after college. While a dog can stay at a friend’s house, the reality is that it’s just being deposited at another student’s house, which is quite likely furnished with empty cans of Natty Ice, chips and takeaway boxes. Not the ideal habitat for a dog.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are we a dog’s best friend if we keep it locked inside all day?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also worth mentioning that </span><a href=\"https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/animal-madness/amp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dogs suffer from anxiety.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I wonder if the constant music on DP, the crowded parties and the irregular walking hours could damage a pup’s mental health. Being locked up in a house with 14 people is a lot to handle for any person. At least students have the opportunity to leave — their dogs don’t. There are long-term implications to consider as well: who will take your dog if you decide to travel after college? What if your dog doesn’t like its new owners? These are all valid questions that are easy to ignore when one is being offered an adorable husky-labrador puppy free of charge. The sad reality remains that all dogs need constant care and attention. A pet shouldn’t be reduced to an accessory or a conversation starter at Sands (we’ve all done it). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other ways to get your doggy dosage besides owning a pup. UCSB counselling even </span><a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/services/frequently-asked-questions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offers resources</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allow students to engage with animals more humanely. This dog-owning debate is not limited to students either. Many</span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41178699.pdf?casa_token=ugXNQHir3gsAAAAA:7NADWjw3w9FH39YYrTH8oR8nt4tbVGB7cwQF3H08SjqwH8wILNiBMSkRpUjB_OW5-OSy7LCVKgh6t08YL-Zi12aXibyOCuD9My31aAZNzIQMc6hDMBE\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">academics</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have questioned the ethics of having a dog at all. The increased demand for emotional support animals is also greatly contested as becoming </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/pets-allowed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exploitative.</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, the same conclusions seem to resurface: if the dog is happy, healthy and well cared for, it’s a mutually positive experience for both parties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no definitive answer to this ethical dilemma, it is certainly worth thinking about before one decides to impulsively adopt a puppy. Are we a dog’s best friend if we keep it locked inside all day? The life of a student is busy, and even the most responsible of us have class, internships and a job to deal with. But that is the modern world, and maybe the reality for most dogs nowadays. It certainly is for many city dogs. Of course, numerous dogs in I.V. have been rescued or are genuinely needed for emotional support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing else, this ordeal has taught me that while dog poo does not cause long-term damage to carpets, it is symbolic of the potentially lasting effects that student dog ownership can have on a pup.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

opioids</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for his back pain after the accident. He started taking more and more pills, eventually increasing his dosage from one pill to 25 pills a day. His mother described her opioid-addicted son as a completely different person from who he was before. He was withdrawn,  hostile and refused to seek treatment leading up to his death from an overdose only two years after the accident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie’s mother June has </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rxawareness/stories/katie.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">struggled with addiction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ever since Katie was a young girl. June was always in and out of Katie’s life, creating a troubling environment for her to grow up in. Upon reflection, Katie understands this had less to do with who her mother was and far more to do with the terrible effects opioids can have on a person. Her mother felt like she needed the drugs and would do almost anything to continue taking them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cases of Christopher and June are simply two out of hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from opioid addiction in this country. The opioid crisis has sent shockwaves through the country as horrifying numbers of people have died from overdoses and many continue to battle their addictions. In the past few weeks, there have been </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/opioid-epidemic-companies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the people closest to the proliferation of this tragic trend — the executives of the pharmaceutical companies. By no means are these companies innocent bystanders to everything that has occurred. While talks of settlement mark some progress in achieving justice for the victims and ameliorating the damage done, it is simply not enough. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pharmaceutical companies were directly involved in </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggressive marketing strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that resulted in doctors overprescribing dangerous and addictive painkillers.

Several candidates are unhappy with the fact that the executives seem to be getting away more or less scot-free because, even if they end up paying financially, they will still come out as billionaires.

She called for “an America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don’t get museum wings named after them; they go to jail.” The wealthy have been able to buy their way out of punishment for blatantly committing crimes in this country for too long. They should not be considered above the law simply because of the amount of money they have. Senator Kamala Harris </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also touched upon this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referring to the ramifications of the opioid crisis as a “matter of justice and accountability.” Pharmaceutical executives need to be held accountable for their actions — actions which have resulted in more than </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/opioid-epidemic-companies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200,000 deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call for criminal prosecution against those most directly involved in the opioid crisis is by no means unprecedented. A few months ago, top executives of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/3/18528123/insys-fentanyl-trial-verdict-john-kapoor-opioid-epidemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insys Therapeutics </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were convicted of criminal racketeering for their role in the crisis. They were found to have been paying doctors to overprescribe opioids and falsely advertise its pain management capabilities. There is </span><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2089370/effectiveness-risks-long-term-opioid-therapy-chronic-pain-systematic-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barely any evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> correlating the effectiveness of opioids with treating chronic pain and there is certainly not enough for them to have been prescribed at such a high rate. While it is an important step that the Insys executives were convicted on criminal charges, it is important to note that their founder, John Kapoor, whose net worth before this was </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/02/insys-therapeutics-john-kapoor-found-guilty-fentanyl-bribery-case/3561518002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is a person of color. It does not sit right that he is one of the few executives who has been prosecuted while no member of the Sackler family, all white, has been subjected to the criminal justice system. This only furthers the notion that being a rich, white male in this country is considered an appropriate exemption from receiving the same treatment as anyone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This begs the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered a criminal act to kill a person in a car accident. It is considered a criminal act to kill a person through an armed robbery. This raises the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans. They have lied and cheated their way through the medical system only to receive more profit in the process. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/10/20881636/sacklers-purdue-opioid-epidemic-prison-prosecution-criminal-investigation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Sackler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently stated that “we have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are the reckless criminals.” Not only is this is a completely inaccurate deflection of blame, but it also shows how pharmaceutical executives will do anything to deny their role in the crisis. Our criminal justice system needs to treat everyone the same way. It needs to play a more active role in fixing the opioid epidemic and punishing those most involved. How else will this country establish that its notions of justice are not contingent upon socioeconomic status?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop believes that all pharmaceutical executives involved in the opioid crisis should face criminal prosecution and serious prison time for the countless deaths they have caused.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

Last month, they removed a large stone bench following reports that it was being </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/flintstone-bench-removed-donated-to-ivrpd/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“monopolized”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by particular individuals. While this may or may not count as defensive architecture and was ostensibly removed for the well-being of the community, the insidiousness of this action is hard to ignore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to remove the bench draws attention to the allotment (and restriction) of public space, as well as the enforced invisibility of certain demographics. If a supposed “monopoly” of the bench prompted its removal, then who is the bench being monopolized by? Are only students or the socioeconomically advantaged permitted to take up space? When is an area simply being used consistently, and when is it being “monopolized?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words: Who gets to take up public space and why? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surely it is no coincidence that the same people who frequently sit there are older men and women who also occasionally ask for a spare dollar and often make use of curbs and outdoor public spaces in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, the houseless population has comprised a substantial part of the Isla Vista community.

It is no surprise then that the people most negatively affected by defensive architecture in Isla Vista are those who are most socially and economically vulnerable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covering the ground with spikes or placing a divider on a bench doesn’t improve the life circumstances of the people who use those spaces; it only deprives them of a space to exist. Cities have been and continue to be hard at work </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to provide more resources for these communities, but rather to transform socioeconomic barriers into physical ones. One might be tempted to dismiss the removal of the bench and other aspects of defensive architecture, as it is easy to dismiss things that don’t affect ourselves personally. Still, this phenomenon reflects the disturbing notion that people don’t want to help other people. People don’t care if others have nowhere else to gather, sit, sleep or even use the bathroom. They just don’t want to see them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the removal of the Flinstone bench is indicative of larger negative trends, this does not discount the good that has been done in recent years in the Santa Barbara and Isla Vista communities. For example, cities such as Santa Barbara are alloting increased funds to aid the houseless population, although problems still arise with </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/01/good-news-and-bad-for-santa-barbara-citys-homeless-people/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how this money is being allocated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Oftentimes, money is spent “dealing with” houselessness, instead of solving issues or helping houseless people. As</span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/01/good-news-and-bad-for-santa-barbara-citys-homeless-people/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, $5 million are spent annually addressing the ‘practical’ repercussions of houselessness, as opposed to the $1 million used to actually remedy the issue itself. This proportion should be flipped: Rather than spending vast amounts of money on after effects such as cleanup, camp sweep-outs and service calls, these resources and time should be aimed at more reparative efforts, like </span><a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/la-homelessness-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increasing available housing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/la-homelessness-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support programs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who gets to take up public space and why?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the city of Santa Barbara continuously prioritizes the ‘established’ community more than that of the houseless, Isla Vista has made hopeful steps in a more productive and more compassionate direction. A positive local development occurred in 2014 with the construction of  Isla Vista houseless shelter, t</span><a href=\"https://localwiki.org/islavista/Houseless_in_IV\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he Pescadero Lofts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I hope those who are, like me, privileged enough to ignore these realities take a step back and notice the ways the public landscape influences real lives. I urge cities to take the more compassionate, humane approach and to stop prioritizing the needs of the city over the needs of the person. As the general public we may not have control over the way our cities are planned, covered and designed. At the same time, we can refute with our own voices the insidious tactics of defensive architecture, increased policing or even the simple removal of a bench and demand that public spaces remain public. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Dager wants cities to do better.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I never thought twice about Biden’s behavior, especially towards women. However, after naively riding the Hillary train in 2016 and living through three years of the Trump administration, I’ve realized that as voters and citizens, we need to start expecting more from our politicians. This might seem obvious, as the people we elect should reflect our own personal beliefs and values. Because this idea speaks loudly to what we Americans truly value, inappropriate behavior towards anybody should not be tolerated, ever, especially from someone in the highest possible position of power in our country. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the allegations against Trump are far more horrific than those against Biden, another major difference between the two is our perceptions of their actions. Across many circles, Trump is known for being a lifelong capitalist and irresponsible businessman; he is not considered a “nice guy,” which is obvious from the way left-wing news sources like </span><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/clinton-trump-led-people-to-be-more-sexist-and-misogynistic-1047128643921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MSNBC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> criticize him. As for me, I have never expected anything from Trump in regard to “niceness” because, well, I never really placed him on a pedestal. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2020. His actions, seen as something that reflects his age or a generational difference, are not treated in the same manner as Trump’s transgressions. Why? Because when it comes down to it, most citizens still see Joe Biden as a “nice guy.” And for these type of men, this behavior is completely acceptable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Biden might come across as a nice old man who is BFFs with Obama, he fails to conduct himself in a way that is up to presidential standards.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is evident in Biden’s handling of the Anita Hill case from his time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1991, Professor Anita Hill alleged that Clarence Thomas </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-was-in-charge-of-the-anita-hill-hearing-even-he-says-it-wasnt-fair/2019/04/26/a9a6f384-6500-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.48f1bf2ab6ec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexually harassed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> her when he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As he was a Supreme Court nominee, the case went to the Senate for a hearing. However, the controversy largely came to revolve around </span><a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/guide-joe-biden-anita-hill-controversy.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biden’s mishandling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the hearings, which ranged from confusing questions to inappropriate comments from other senators. Since then, Biden has failed to apologize for not controlling the hearing and for allowing for the mistreatment of Hill because of the biased opinions of senators. Especially in the midst of the #MeToo movement, do we really want a president that fails to give women an opportunity to share their story? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What many of us fail to realize is that “nice guys” can be creeps too. Being nice to your grandma or your teachers does not give these guys the right to act inappropriately toward others — especially women. Being in a position of power does not give “nice guys” an excuse to touch a woman without her consent. We need to start asking ourselves what we truly want out of our elected officials. Although the characteristics Americans value may differ, many want politicians to practice what they preach. Although Biden might come across as a nice old man who is BFFs with Obama, he fails to conduct himself in a way that is up to presidential standards. For this reason, the public should be more critical of his behavior and the Democratic Party should not endorse him in the 2020 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what party you lean towards, as citizens we should expect more of the candidates we choose. We should not vote for someone because they seem like the best of the worst, like many did with former Secretary Clinton in 2016 or vote for someone who is incapable of keeping his hands off of the women around him. As a Democrat, I expect my party to be as infuriated with Biden’s behavior as they are with Trump’s. Although their actions might be of different calibers, they still reflect their attitudes toward women. It is not about different generations or a difference in perception; it is about 2020 being the year that we students vote for someone who represents the qualities we look for in our friends, peers and within ourselves, because these nice guys?
