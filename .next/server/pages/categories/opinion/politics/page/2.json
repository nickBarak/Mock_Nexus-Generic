These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately one in five women and one in 16 men </span><a href=\"https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be sexually assaulted in college</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only around 10% of survivors report their assaults to law enforcement. This is due to a number of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator/associates/friends and the hesitation to put oneself through the physically and emotionally invasive process of reporting. Now the despicable allegations against the community’s own police force is another contributing factor that survivors must consider before choosing to report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sexual assault is a crime based on power dynamics. As an inherently powerful figment in the community, the UCPD is exacerbating that power imbalance by allegedly exploiting people who have been physically, mentally and emotionally violated. They have allegedly abused their power to prey on and mock people who have sought their aid, people who are hopeful that their power can help serve justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations against officers in our own community are exponentially detrimental to the relationship that the police will have with UCSB students and I.V. residents in the months and years to come. The damage is done; the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-calling-for-disarmament-of-campus-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inherent community distrust of the police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is only heightened by these claims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a society plagued with </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/20-25-reported-rapes-in-isla-vista-over-3-year-period-csd-report-finds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looming statistics of sexual violence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our police should be beacons of support and justice. Instead they allegedly mock victims of assault, joking about the immense suffering and trauma that they endure. These alleged actions minimize and invalidate the experiences of survivors and, in turn, create a toxic environment that discourages reporting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College communities are particularly privy to sexual assault, and if these allegations are true, it is impossible to quantify the number of people that the UCPD has hurt over the years with their callous mockery of people who are courageous enough to come to them seeking help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are not the only people who are left feeling as though they had nowhere to turn (if they even still considered the police worth going to for help). The officers named in the lawsuit also allegedly made derogatory comments against people of color (including students and faculty). Officer Michael Little allegedly spoke of a fantasy in which a Black man attempts to rob him: “Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I passed by the department after the article’s publication I was left with chills down my spine and goosebumps on my arms. When we hear horrific stories of insidious actions carried out by cops, it often feels removed, if we are lucky enough to have that privilege. But now, face to face with the police building, if true, it is disturbing to realize what inexcusable behavior allegedly took place inside its unassuming walls. It is disturbing to realize how many people we know were hurt by the reported comments, stereotyping and mockery made behind those doors. These are the cops we see out on the streets at night after parties. We </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-11/not-your-exotic-babe-navigating-i-v-as-ethnically-ambiguous/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">say nothing when they hit on us</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or when they give us trouble because we know better than to pick a fight with a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some cops in the community seem like they try to relate to the younger-skewing demographic of the I.V. community. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself even had a column from as recent as late 2015 run by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/category/question-authority-opinion/?fbclid=IwAR3qwzs0f31uJvbwKBJh7RW0vsnTX4tH7zqwMBDY8taPJU6PW0-Yqu1T5kM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Mark Signa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against UCPD and frequently negatively mentioned in another. Even if Lt. Signa is unfairly portrayed in these allegations, the alleged “Good Ole Boys’ Club” fostered within the UCPD seems to have contributed heavily to the normalization of this culture of toxicity that has run rampant in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, the reputation of the UCSB UCPD could be irreparably damaged; there’s a chance the community will never look at the UCPD in the same way again. I find it deeply ironic that the department, which has recently contributed to a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/i-v-and-santa-barbara-groups-address-sexual-violence-in-video-series/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series of videos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extolling sentiments of belief and support for survivors, is facing such disturbing allegations regarding the dehumanization of victims of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, these allegations will likely be widely believed by the community. The department should not have tried to bury these allegations that go back several years; instead, they should have made a statement in an effort of transparency. These allegations never would have seen the light of day had members of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not physically gone through court records to find them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations and the effort to hide them from the public eye will alter the UCPD’s relationship with the community for years — if not decades — to come, and that will hurt the students above anyone else.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anonymous thinks that UCSB students deserve a police force

time here: I’ve spent hours studying in the brand-new wing of Davidson, I’ve seen the construction of multiple brand-new housing options, and I’ve seen upgrades to the Rec Cen and the student dining commons. But while this trend has ultimately been positive, it has also revealed some of the university’s greatest growing pains. And as the current chair of the UCen Governance Board, as well as an employee of the UCen for the past 2.5 years, I’ve come to understand one of these pain points firsthand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen, situated in the middle of campus, is one UCSB’s hallmark buildings. Originally built in 1968, the building was intended to be a common ground for students, faculty, and staff to convene and converse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some areas in the UCen haven’t been upgraded since its construction, and over time, it’s become a tarnished and underutilized space. For example, last quarter, leaks caused a ceiling tile to fall to the ground, narrowly missing a student studying for finals. And just last week, one of the building’s main water pipes burst, causing flooding in multiple areas and creating an unpleasant smell throughout the whole facility. At times, it can feel like the building is bursting at the seams; it’s clear the UCen can no longer meet the needs of our current student population. What’s more, when set against the backdrop of UCSB’s growing student body, the building’s shortfalls become even more dire.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why the UCen Governance Board has facilitated a proposal to address this problem, a plan we’re calling “Our NewCen.” The goal of the “NewCen” proposal is to both expand the UCen to increase general-purpose student space such as study space and meeting rooms, but also to re-purpose parts of the UCen to meet student needs that aren’t currently fulfilled by existing campus resources.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we don’t act soon, future Gauchos will be putting money into a building that is potentially hazardous, but also isn’t able to adequately serve their needs.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As news about “Our NewCen” has made its way around campus, I think there’s been some confusion as to what the revenue generated from this fee would be used for. Lots of students have understood the buzz-phrase “UCen renovations” to be limited to cosmetic updates such as carpeting, paint, etc., but in reality, this project goes far beyond that. “Our NewCen” reimagines the UCen to be the central hub on campus, where students can access the services they need most, like the A.S. Food Bank, counseling and mental wellness, and tutoring and 24-hour study space.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fee referendum proposed by “Our NewCen” would begin in 2018 and calls for a $20 per quarter fee for the first four years, during which architects would be hired to collaborate with students, finalize the “NewCen’s” design, and determine how to put the concept into action. Once construction ends in 2022, the fee rises to $96 per quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this project does not begin now, the UCen will continue to be outdated, and UCSB students of the very near future will find themselves in an even more crowded environment than the one we currently find ourselves in. Furthermore, the UCen continues to deteriorate without renovation. Dangerous instances like the broken ceiling tile and burst water pipes will increase in both frequency and cost to students with the passing of time. This means that if we don’t act soon, future Gauchos will be putting money into a building that is potentially hazardous, but also isn’t able to adequately serve their needs. Much like past Gauchos voted for fee increases to fund the Rec Cen and SRB (facilities we all use and enjoy), we have the opportunity to make a similar decision for our future generations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will be graduating in the spring. Though this means I would be unaffected by the potential student fee increase, it also provides me a state of objectivity with regards to the project. Outside of the UCen Governance Board, I am not otherwise involved in student government, and will be leaving academia to pursue a career in a field unrelated to public policy or community projects. With that in mind, I will be voting to affirm this fee increase because I believe it will improve UCSB in a number of ways, and will prevent what would be an inevitable strain on future students and community spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether this year or in years to come, it’s undeniable that the UCen will require a major overhaul at some point. A project of this magnitude will only prove more urgent as the UCen deteriorates, and more expensive as time goes on. Ultimately, it is up to you, the student body, to weigh the costs and benefits and decide whether to fund a project for the future. Above all and most importantly, be sure to vote and participate in AS elections to take part in the democracy that you are a part of, and ensure that your voice is heard.</span></p>\n<p><em>Luke McCrary wants to make sure that the NewCen has a fair chance.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82448\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/a-case-for-the-newcen-it-is-time-for-change/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82448\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/a-case-for-the-newcen-it-is-time-for-change/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/a-case-for-the-newcen-it-is-time-for-change/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/a-case-for-the-newcen-it-is-time-for-change/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/a-case-for-the-newcen-it-is-time-for-change/","id":4852,"author":{"id":815,"name":"Luke McCrary"},"related":[4851,4850,4849],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ole Gaucho’s Gotta Go","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Politics","publish_date":"2018-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mapache2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Aside from simply redressing Ole to resemble a true gaucho, negating this whole mess, we could try something new.

Despite starting in March as a joke, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has quickly blossomed into a movement. Be it our memes, our conversations, or our streets, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, (Spanish for raccoon), has taken UCSB by storm. The now infamous petition started by Infante, demands the retirement of the gaucho in favor of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and UCSB students were quick to agree. Gathering signatures by the bus load, the petition rapidly surpassed 2,400 signees in the span of a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, UCSB, then-known as Santa Barbara State College, championed the Roadrunners as its mascot.

Inspired by Douglas Fairbanks’s performance in the 1927 silent film, “The Gaucho,” students voted to change the mascot from the feeble Roadrunner, to something with a bit more grit, and thus the Gaucho was born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born from good intentions, the Gaucho mascot has been met with increasing scrutiny. Some argue UCSB’s use of the gaucho is cultural appropriation, while others claim the gaucho, or really Ole (sorry Ole), is just plain creepy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural appropriation is a sociological concept that describes a majority power taking elements from a minority power’s culture, and using them sacrilegiously and distastefully, typically in some caricature form. This usually occurs due to ignorance of the correct usage and meaning of the elements in question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, while cultural appropriation is normally some mild racial offense, it shouldn’t be confused with cultural exchange or assimilation. Cultural exchange is defined as one or more cultures sharing and adopting elements as a form of goodwill and understanding. In assimilation, we see the blending and mixing of cultures to form a larger one.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from simply redressing Ole to resemble a true gaucho, negating this whole mess, we could try something new. Retire the old gaucho and let the Mapaches take the reins.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either which way, it’s becoming increasingly evident that critics of the Gaucho mascot may have a point. In UCSB’s use of the gaucho, we find a man, Ole, with an unshaven face, a comically large handlebar mustache, a Zorro like mask and a giant unsettling grin all tucked beneath a sombrero and stuffed into an athletic jersey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the cultural appropriation definition, the sombrero and tacky mustache become difficult to justify when the rest of Ole is encased in modern clothes. This culminates with the failure to resemble even an ounce of a true gaucho at all. At this point it may as well be some mustache guy in a hat, so much so that calling this thing a gaucho is an insult to the true badass nature of the actual gaucho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put this in perspective, imagine USC stripped their famous Trojan down to basically the helmet and put it on some random guy, then earnestly championed him as if he were a member of the same fierce warriors of Troy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make matters worse, the complete disregard for the gaucho is intentional. Looking at UCSB’s athletic site we find everything that went wrong into creating our gaucho mascot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, we learn that Ole dawns his mask solely as a reference to the “Phantom of the Dome,” a masked man that riled UCSB sports crowds during the ’90s, and not as a reference to any kind of gaucho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, Ole doesn’t look up to Fairbank’s character, nor any actual gaucho at all. No, all that Ole personally aspires to be is Gaucho Joe, and the Phantom of the Dome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the icing on the cake comes from Ole’s implication of immigration status, as Ole refuses to state his date of birth, as it’s on the IRS to find out. Such implications are distasteful and insensitive, especially with the uncertain futures many undocumented immigrants face in our current political climate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from simply redressing Ole to resemble a true gaucho, negating this whole mess, we could try something new. Retire the old gaucho and let the Mapaches take the reins.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mere possibility of being a Mapache inspires pride that I didn’t know UCSB students could possess. It gives us a glimmer of hope that one day we wouldn’t have to explain our mascot to anyone else ever again.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raccoons have been an integral part of Isla Vista’s culture, myths and history.

Like UCSB students, the furry critters are creatures of honor, nobility and cleverness. While in droves, they are akin to the swaths of students that wander back and forth through campus each day. In legends, the albino raccoon wanders through the streets of I.V. and is said to be an omen of wisdom and light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s more, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapaches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just seem to connect with UCSB students. Taking a look at UCSB’s meme page, you’d be hard pressed to find many posts that doesn’t have some mention of the mapache. From just this week alone the use of mapache has skyrocketed on both Facebook and Google’s search engine. Even further, the mere mention of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a group of UCSB students excites them. The mere possibility of being a Mapache inspires pride that I didn’t know UCSB students could possess. It gives us a glimmer of hope that one day we wouldn’t have to explain our mascot to anyone else ever again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the adoption of the Mapache mascot doesn’t mean the end of any of UCSB’s time-honored traditions. If anything, it would just justify them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, tortilla throwing, a cherished UCSB tradition, makes no sense from a gaucho’s point of view, (why waste food?) while it does from a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Throwing of the tortillas means more food for our beloved trash pandas. Likewise, the chants that UCSB students stammer don’t have to end either. Substituting “Mapache” in place of “Gaucho” seems to have little to no effect on either the meaning nor the rhyme of the chant. Taking things from a logistics perspective, all things considered, this transition could happen easily, and swiftly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From petitions, to designs, to excitement, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wholeheartedly encapsulates everything that is the fighting spirit of UCSB. So much so, that some students excitedly took the mapache moniker with pride. As such, it is without question, that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mapache</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is of worth to champion UCSB and its students.</span></p>\n<p><em>Kekai ‘O Kalani Akita wants our favorite furry friends to be elevated to the mascot status they deserve.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82172\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/ole-gauchos-gotta-go/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82172\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/ole-gauchos-gotta-go/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/ole-gauchos-gotta-go/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/ole-gauchos-gotta-go/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/ole-gauchos-gotta-go/","id":4842,"author":{"id":810,"name":"Kekai O Kalani Akita"},"related":[4841,4840,4839],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"route":"/categories/opinion/politics","highestPage":2}},"__N_SSG":true}
