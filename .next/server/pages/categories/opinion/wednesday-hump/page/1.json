I know that the issue of double standards between men and women as it pertains to gender is not a new one. What I don’t understand is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it still exists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people come to college excited to gain new and adventurous experiences. For many, this includes exploring their sex lives. It seems as though having many wild sexual encounters is an expectation of the normal male college experience, and men rarely get shamed for their Friday-night decisions. And yet, I see women being shamed all the time for having similar experiences. Words like “hoe,” “thot” and “bitch” are used every day around Isla Vista. The idea of a girl “giving it up easily” and thus being “easy” is seen as an absolute atrocity, yet the more girls a man can bed, the better.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, I don’t believe that the idea of having sex with random strangers multiple times a day on a regular basis should be a celebrated norm for anybody. This is for many reasons, but namely because sex is often such a personal and emotional experience and because of legitimate health risks associated with this activity (namely STIs). However, I also believe that neither my, nor anyone else’s, personal feelings about sex should affect anyone else’s choices. I think that a lot of girls make decisions about sex that they wouldn’t make otherwise because they feel judged or shamed by society. For instance, I know a lot of girls who are concerned about keeping their “number” down in order to avoid having a high “body count,” meaning that they deny themselves the full range of sexual experiences they desire to have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sick of the idea that a girl isn’t the “bring-home-to-mom type” because she makes even a third of the choices that a man might make regarding sex. I am sick of seeing men get high-fives for behavior that would earn a woman a reputation that could follow them around for the rest of their lives. I am sick of hearing horrible stories about the “hoe” or “school bike” of people’s high school classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sick of the fact that the guys that choose to be especially promiscuous often shame the very girls they are involved with. At the very least, they should respect these women who are making the exact same choices as them. Of course, I hope that all women respect themselves and make choices that they are comfortable and content with. Everyone should hold themselves accountable for taking care of themselves and making healthy choices. And yet, we shouldn’t make it our business to tear down those who we see doing things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is entitled to and has a right to their personal preferences and beliefs, but must we always make other people’s business our business? We are all on our own paths, learning from our own decisions. Your body is your choice. All that should matter to other people about your decisions is that they are safe ones.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hazel Siff wishes people would keep their noses out of other people’s sex lives.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/","id":6467,"author":{"id":784,"name":"Hazel Siff"},"related":[6466,6465,6464],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Porn Stars Rise to Fame by Keeping it Real","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2020-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/verified.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Pei Ja Anderson talks with I.V. based PornHub sensation Isla Summer and talks about the new ideals within the influencer community.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the quest for authenticity, influencers are curating a new type of aesthetic. Today, trendiness is no longer measured by the number of likes on your avocado toast pictures and hyper-posed selfies but instead by the relatability of your content. Realism has replaced aspiration. Recently, sites like Instagram and Pornhub champion content creators who’ve managed to perfect this amateur aesthetic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through ad revenue, brand deals and sponsorships, “influencing” has established itself beyond Gen Z speak, garnering attention as a legitimate — and highly lucrative — career. These revenue streams exist not only on YouTube, Instagram and other social media giants but in adult entertainment as well. Being an influencer is equal to being a modern-day entrepreneur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undeniably, one of the titans in the new wave of mainstream pornography is Pornhub. Conservative estimates value the the porn industry at </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/16/mia-khalifa-is-among-worlds-most-watched-women-yet-porn-industry-is-keeping-profits/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around $2 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, due in part to porn’s stigma and the secretiveness surrounding the industry. Less conservative estimates stipulate that porn generates more annual revenue than both the NFL and Netflix. With these monster profits, the porn industry directs the spotlight toward pornography’s creators, who are no longer puppeted by major corporations and studios. Instead, business is created and managed by the film stars themselves. This shift in the porn business model has enabled anyone to become an adult-film star overnight. Welcome to the world of amateur pornography.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

People not only watch porn but feel just as invested in the lives of amateur porn stars as they do with their favorite influencers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Pornhub celebrated the 10th anniversary of their </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2018/11/20/pornhubs-model-program-has-paid-out-millions-defining-a-new-type-of-influencer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Model Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which hosts over a hundred thousand amateurs on their site. </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/islasummer_?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just one of them. The account is run by a young, college-aged couple in the Isla Vista community. After creating their account and posting their first video over spring break this past school year, they’ve become a household name among the community, with their content having been featured on Pornhub’s home page multiple times. To date, their account has received 20.2 million views and counting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer’s popularity is due to the recent demand for amateur porn coupled with their ability to strategize as influencers: They’re curating content that their audience wants to see. Summer, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that “most of them are very absurd concepts and simple, easy-to-follow but absurd storylines,” because “it just catches the eye when you see that type of title online. You just have to click it.” They added that their “most popular video is where me playing 2K is the main focus of it.” The brand they’ve created — young, attractive and, most importantly, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> college students — is not the only reason they’ve been hugely successful; it’s also because they are aware of their brand and viewership and have utilized the amateur aesthetic to their advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring shots of the UCSB Library and local places in Santa Barbara, their content is starkly different from the manufactured look of a studio-produced film. </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444810362853\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the meaning of amateurism in porn, Susanna Paasonen discusses why amateur work’s higher sense of realism is attractive to consumers. It’s because amateurism is about mimicking reality: it’s truthful. While the ring lights of a professional studio and glamorous facades used to dominate the porn industry, it’s now all about the opposite. People want to see representations of sexual acts as truthful and authentic — the imperfect bodies and blemishes that make it feel, as one consumer of porn puts it, “like you’re in that setting or you’re that person.” This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being unfiltered is the new status quo. As Summer puts it: “People expect our lives to be, like, wildly different now, because they view us as porn stars but we’re exactly the same.” It’s this sameness that has launched them into fame. It is this transparency, in a clandestine industry, that blurs the lines between consumer and creator, average joe and porn star, which has established amateurism as culturally significant.<br>\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monetary value of relatability is mirrored in other influencer industries. Take Emma Chamberlain, an 18-year old high school dropout turned multimillionaire business mogul. Her minimalistic, carefree aesthetic sets her apart from the hyper-produced, staged look that is popular among big YouTubers like Jake Paul and Bethany Mota. With 8.53 million YouTube subscribers in just under two years, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and record-setting rise to fame are evidence of how the pendulum of popularity has drastically swung in relability’s favor. Her editing style, filled with frequent jump cuts and superzooms, reflects the “quirky girl” personality that has earned her millions of followers. Her content production’s lack of professionalism and willingness to embrace her suburban American roots are qualities with which fans clearly engage and relate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On social media, Chamberlain frequently pokes fun at herself. Her fans say, “Unlike those other YouTubers living in mansions with perfect hair and expensive clothes, she’s just an average teen.” Identically, Isla Summer’s “average teen-ness” is a huge point of profit. More and more, it seems, the value and impact of an influencer can be measured by how accessible they are to their audience. The commodity is no longer the aspirational value; it is the personality, and most importantly, the person or people behind the camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Kardashian and her family may be the best example of this. Her sex tape — the trailer, a six-minute preview leaked in 2007 — still holds its title as </span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pornhub’s most watched video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all time. It is undeniable that her rise to fame and multibillion dollar empire and influencer career stemmed from the film’s release. Whether it was leaked or not — which is still widely debated — the Kardashian family revolutionized the idea of the celebrity, capitalizing on the transition from the public to private sphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to Kardashian, the idea of a celebrity was no longer an untouchable, aspirational figure, seen on Photoshopped magazine covers and commercials, but a personalized, profitable brand that highlighted the creator’s relatability. The influencers of today owe it to the Kardashians for creating an industry career out of thin air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just feel like I’m hanging out with my friends. My camera is my friend,” said </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM8OI8ySYAoealLy-YRCbg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer McKeen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of Chamberlain’s friends and an influencer in her own right. At the heart of influencing is the connection with a fanbase that pays for the glorified influencer’s career and lifestyle under the guise of realism, as if you too can be friends with Kim — only after paying for her new contour palette. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The popularity of realism in porn, it seems, is not an isolated event: The culture has shifted, the tide has changed and content creators like Chamberlain and Isla Summer are leaders of this creative counterculture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily vlogs, “day in the life”-style videos that are popular on YouTube, can be viewed as parallel to Pornhub’s Model Program, which has the same objective: increase the consumer’s access to the creator. </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/double3xposure/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reese Blutstein</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a 22-year-old influencer with a quarter of a million followers, puts it simply: “For my generation, people are more willing to be who they are and not make up a fake identity,” she said. “We are trying to show a real person doing cool things as a real person, not trying to create a persona that isn’t actually you.” This candidness and creator-to-consumer relationship is then monetized for profit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of Pornhub’s Model Program, creators like Isla Summer can offer exclusive, customizable video and photo content, as well as profit from private conversations and texting via Snapchat. This direct-to-consumer distribution method is the reason why Summer said, “In terms of the ad revenue perspective, you get taken care of pretty well being on one of the biggest websites in the world.” It’s all about “trying to get as many eyeballs to see your link as possible, because the more people that click your link, the more advertisers want to use your link to put up their ads.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple went into further detail regarding the ease with which they started their career on Pornhub, saying, “It was so easy. Literally, all we had to do was send them pictures of our IDs and a couple of pictures to verify that we were actually in possession of this account.” Making porn, to Isla Summer, was not with the intention of becoming the next Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. It was about earning an income, as is the objective of nearly all other content creators. The stigma surrounding porn wasn’t evident at all in Isla Summer’s comments or demeanor. As content creators, the sexual element is removed from their titles, with their focus devoted to reaping the benefits of the cash cow that is amateur porn. “Until the internet as we know it dies, this is gonna keep making us more and more money, so we’re just going to try to keep doing what we’re doing,” Summer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overlaps between mainstream influencer culture and amateur pornography are becoming more and more frequent. In the premier of the new season of the YouTube show “</span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-reality-house-show-trisha-paytas-elijah-daniel-contestants-2019-7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reality House</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” a reality competition show in the same vein as “Big Brother,” </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KianAndJc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian and Jc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two big names in the YouTube world, welcomed internet personality and amateur pornstar </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFuuAUSHlQzHMres7AD38Q\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lena The Plug</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into the new cast. Lena The Plug was also nominated for Top Celebrity at the</span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/awards/nominees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2019 Pornhub Awards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWD8su9Sk6GzZDwy9zs3_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tana Mongeau</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian and Stormy Daniels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the technological revolution came the graduation of porn from magazines and VCRs to our phones, just a finger tap away. Today, porn occupies the public, private and even political domain. However the monetization of realism, while economically lucrative and seemingly innocent, is concerning. Without being critical of our content, it’s easy to be unable to decipher when a photo or video has gone through rounds of editing or seen the desks of producers and managers when it’s posed — and branded — as organic. The amateur aesthetic is dangerous in deceiving its audiences and arguably equally as dangerous as the blatant Photoshop fails and hyper-edited magazine covers. Where professionalism connotes skill and quality, amateurism embodies spontaneity and truthfulness. However, both are representations of reality that have been deliberately manufactured. Who’s to say what lies underneath the facade of an #unfiltered post? Regardless, what is not up for debate is the cultural impact of the amateur. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson supports YouTube influencers, amateur porn stars and Instagram baddies everywhere. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I’ve seen friends agree to threesomes at the insisting of their significant other, only to back out at the last minute because they were never really comfortable with having a threesome to begin with. Even if everyone’s sexual orientations and attractions align, people’s relationship status, gender, sexual orientation or anything else can play a role in the power they have over the other parties. Being conscious of that not only allows everyone to feel respected but also leads to better sex, because everyone is fully into the sexcapades that will take place without even unintentional persuasion.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Threesomes don’t usually go down the way they do in porn</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One hilariously disastrous night, a friend and I met up with an acquaintance and ended up deciding to go back to his place. My friend and I were both quite attracted to each other and to him, so we decided to get down and dirty. Although, admittedly, there were definitely some warning signs we should have picked up on, we were caught off guard when halfway through he asked us to “suck his dick together.” Immediately, my friend and I looked at each other, laughed and said, “Sorry, but we have to go now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, the mechanics of a double-dick sucking seem awkward and not as pleasurable as the fantasy of it is. Secondly, we realized that he had no desire to engage with us in this real, sexy, enjoyable experience, and instead he wanted to recreate his idea of a threesome. I didn’t feel like I was being treated like a person and an active equal participant in this sexual encounter. It’s hard to blame him, however, with flashy porn titles like “Her Boyfriend’s Cock in Another Girl’s Pussy” and “Stepsisters Share Big Dick” shown on the first page of Pornhub.com. Popular culture and movies only reinforce the stereotype that threesomes are an exclusively heterosexual cis-male fantasy. However, they don’t have to be. If you throw out these images and go into the encounter wanting to simply explore and experience being with two bodies, you can see how rewarding the experience can truly be. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Beware of having threesomes with couples*</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This tip comes with an asterisk. I and many others have had great experiences having threesomes with a couple. Some couples view threesomes as a way to feel closer to each other because they’re having a new sexual experience together. I’ve also found being the “unicorn” to be very sexually rewarding, as both members of the couple often focused on my sexual wantings more. Since they had slept together before, exploring my body was newer and more exciting for them, and my body became the center of attention. However, jealousy and cheating are two major issues that can come into play, especially with couples. Several of my friends have had their partners use threesomes as a way to start cheating on them. Even if the power in threesomes isn’t used to hurt people, there is an inherent jealousy that many people feel when they watch their partner enjoy having sex with someone else. Hence the asterisk.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>All three parties involved must be prepared for the emotional consequences</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the dynamics of a romantic relationship don’t come into play, fucking your friends may change the relationships you’ve established. It’s a good idea to have some clarity on what everyone wants to get out of the threesome </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preferably before the sexy time starts. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Threesome:</span></em></p>\n<p><b>COMMUNICATION IS KEY</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with pretty much any time you swap bodily fluids with someone (or several someones), communicating during the act makes everything go more smoothly. There are three bodies involved instead of just two, and that can be pretty awkward unless you’re comfortable communicating what you want to the other two people with you. Properly communicating can also alleviate feelings of performance anxiety, insecurity or jealousy, as it allows everyone to feel on the same page during this intimate act. </span></p>\n<p><b>Threesomes should not just be two people having sex and then switching off</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody wants to feel left out, and especially during a threesome, every partner should feel like they’re playing an active role in the sexual activities. Often people go into their first threesome and expect that it will mirror the way they have sex with one other person. The beauty of threesomes is that it can be a completely new experience than just having sex with one person and then switching to focus on the other person. Lots of sexual positions can facilitate everyone getting involved, depending on which sex acts people agree to participate in. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the Threesome:</span></em></p>\n<p><b>Check in</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the sex itself is amazing and everyone enjoyed it, there are lingering feelings that creep up after the fact. Checking in on the days that follow can help settle those feelings in a constructive way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this guide is nowhere near as comprehensive nor specific as to how a threesome might happen for you, it is a step toward normalizing threesomes and having them seen as a thrilling way to connect with more than one person. Threesomes have been demonized, often for women, as a shameful act that only those who don’t respect themselves would do. For men, they’re seen as the height of sexual prowess — the most sought-after sexual encounter. For queer people, especially non-binary people, threesomes are represented in ways that are heteronormative and cisgendered, which causes people to enter these situations with inaccurate expectations. It doesn’t have to be that way! Now that you have some idea of what to expect, go out there and unabashedly enjoy hooking up with as many consenting partners as your heart desires. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This anonymous Gaucho wants to get real about staying kinky in I.V.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/","id":6390,"author":{"id":785,"name":"Anonymous Gaucho"},"related":[6389,6388,6387],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Don’t Choke Me, Daddy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-06-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Choking-e1559952035350.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Choking-e1559952035350.png?resize=650%2C464&ssl=1","description":"Eloise Scott emphasizes the importance of getting consent before getting kinky.

It’s a Saturday night, and you head over to a DIY band show in your friend’s garage. You meet up with some buds who are all wearing typical indie scene ’fits, complete with flannels and baggy cuffed pants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s this cute guy across the garage, who clearly thinks that making eye contact with you twice counts as shooting his shot. You decide to play along, though, as he makes his way over to you through the crowd. He reaches one of your friends and starts talking to them about the class they had together last quarter. Your friends see the way you’re both ogling each other, so they leave you to get to talking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s cute and funny and charming.

He plays it off as if he simply doesn’t want you to have to walk all the way home. You don’t mind even a little bit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He lives in a house with all male roommates, who look at you with jealousy as their boy brings you back to his room. Everything feels exciting and spontaneous, and you know exactly where this night is headed. It feels good to be intoxicated and sweaty and wanted for the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s this awkward moment, as you both sit on his bed, but he quickly asks if he can kiss you and you say yes. The next moment you’re tangled up in his sheets, while he’s kissing you hot and heavy. Even though he tastes like cigarettes and bad beer, he’s still a good kisser. As the make-out session really ramps up, the clothes come off, and he’s consistently asking if you’re okay at every step.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then all of a sudden, he puts his hand around your neck and starts to squeeze. You open your eyes immediately because you’re so caught off guard. You’re not sure if he can feel the fact that you froze, but he eventually takes his hand off your neck. Throughout the night, he hadn’t given you any reason to think he would be “that guy,” as he asked for consent religiously. But in that moment, you’re rightfully afraid and scared for your safety</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Choking can be a nice form of breath play that really spices up a sexual encounter, but it should happen with clear and informed consent.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I thought encounters like these were one-off experiences and I felt responsible for getting myself into these situations. My internal slut-shaming voice chimed in to remind me that I deserved this for how free and casual I was about going home with this guy. Back in the guy’s room, I dismissed the terror I felt, justifying it by telling myself that it was fine because choking has become such a common kink, and he had been respectful during the lead up to that act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I opened up to my friends about the several times that I have experienced this, and, unfortunately, they echoed my sentiment, saying that they had also experienced people choking them during first-time casual hookups. When I was removed from the heat of the moment, it struck me how truly messed up it is that we’ve had virtual strangers perform such a violent act without any consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond how incredibly violated I felt, choking can also be really dangerous for people with any sort of breathing or heart problems, especially when it’s so unexpectedly coming from some dude you just met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to be clear that I’m not trying to kink shame anyone. I like being choked just as much as the next slightly submissive kinkster. But you’re engaging in a really scary and vulnerable act when you allow yourself to be choked. I’m not going to trust just anyone to physically take away my blood or air supply, especially when I literally just met them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choking can be a nice form of breath play that really spices up a sexual encounter, but it should happen with clear and informed consent. I’ve had much better sexual encounters where a guy has put his hand gently on my neck and asked if that was okay. Although this consent is required, it felt really comfortable and excited for someone to respect me in the way I deserve to be respected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as consent needs to be considered at every level of a sexual escapade, choking should be thought of as an act that requires explicit consent. It’s surprisingly easy to get consent and ensure that everyone leaves feeling safe and sexy. Politely asking for that permission doesn’t ruin the power dynamics inherent to choking. Instead, it shows that you are deserving of having that person submit to you in that way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time you want to get a little kinky with someone you’ve just met remember that choking shouldn’t be taken so lightly and, most importantly, it requires thorough consent. Or better yet, maybe wait for you and your partner to have a little more experience together before pulling the, “Choke me, Daddy” bit.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eloise Scott keeps her standards low but not when it comes to her sexual safety.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/","id":6387,"author":{"id":783,"name":"Eloise Scott"},"related":[6386,6385,6384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Does Birth Control Always Feel Like a Battlefield?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=650%2C621&ssl=1","description":"Cardi Bradshaw sets the record straight on misconceptions about birth control.

Of course there are those educated gems who do rely on condoms for their sexual activities (and to those heroes, we thank you). But when it comes to pregnancy, cisgender men don’t worry about contraceptives the same way that people who can get pregnant do, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s not their fault. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But do they know what we’re up against?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many forms of </span><a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm#what_is_birth_control_and_how_does_it_work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birth control</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and because it’s no longer a taboo conversation hiding in your doctor’s contraceptive pamphlet, let’s talk about it!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the testimonies of my fellow Gaucho comrades, our frontline contraceptive soldiers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— we honor your legacy:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went on birth control when I was 16. Within five minutes of my first pill I started bleeding, and it went on for weeks. I decided to switch to an IUD , which got dislodged, after a year of consistent bleeding. So now I’m back on the pill with the original problems I had. People say to just stick to condoms, but without the pill I still get my period for two weeks every month and major PMS. Also, condoms aren’t as reliable and not always available on hand. I didn’t want the [birth control] shot because it would make me gain weight, and the ring is difficult to manage. I hate it all.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If men could get pregnant, birth control would be as available as your nearest Starbucks.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was 17 and was prescribed the lowest dosage of estrogen to regulate my period. Within the first two weeks, I was crying almost every day for no reason. By the third week my boobs had went from a B to a D and hurt like hell. I felt angry and anxious, and by the fourth week I thought I was going crazy. When I went back to CVS to pick up the next month’s prescription, the pharmacist apologized for ‘giving me the wrong prescription last month’… Instead of getting my low-estrogen pill that my doctor prescribed me, I was given a form that had weekly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases in estrogen </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and literally wrecked my physical and mental state. This was my introduction to birth control.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got the implant last year when I was 19. It made me so depressed for no reason. I was extremely unhappy and I didn’t know why. I actually had to take my Spring Quarter off and go home because of how depressed I was. As soon as I got the implant removed I was fine … same thing happened to my best friend who also had the implant.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birth control is important, and it</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> privilege</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The message behind having free condoms readily available is essentially a reminder to be safe, an acknowledgement that sex will probably take place so it’s best to be prepared for it. At the beginning of  fall quarter, I saw free condoms being put out, along with tampons and pads. I observed that contraceptives and feminine products were being categorized together, implying some degree of transferability regarding their necessity. This is something I disagree with. You cannot will your period to stop, as awesome as that would be, but (in a perfect world) you can choose whether or not you’d like to have sex.  My discomfort, of course, does not translate into support for any sort of regulation, policing or actions that should be taken. I look back now and see the right to participate freely and explore your sexual identity as something that years of sexual liberation, progress and technological innovation has brought to us. I do however, disagree with the conflation of what I see as cultural pressure to participate in casual sex with being liberated, progressive and “woke.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though feminism and the detachment of sex from traditional stigmas may appear to inevitably support casual sex, that does not mean it is necessarily emotionally healthy. According to a study published by the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/moniTor/2013/02/ce-corner\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on undergraduate students, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">78 percent of women and 72 percent of men who had uncommitted sex (including vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex) reported a history of experiencing regret following such an encounter.” This is all well and good because it’s the individual’s personal choice. But what if we zoom out and observe the cultural implications?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first exposure to the idea of casual sex was … an </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/25/552582404/hookup-culture-the-unspoken-rules-of-sex-on-college-campuses\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the distinctive characteristics of hookup culture.

From a young age, my perception of casual sex was colored by this study. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I saw college parties as a setting for these non-inclusive, hyperheterosexual, primal activities. Also, being in a long-term relationship and coming into this campus as a first-year, I observed the active party culture going on around me. Drawing from my preconceptions I felt skeptical and hesitant to embrace that culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to numbers, my caricatured idea of college life may be incorrect. From a </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40-year study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted between 1976 and 2016 on 18 million teenagers, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54% of high school students in 1991 reported having had sex, while only 41% did in the early 2010s.  This study even suggests that “today’s 18-year-old more closely resembles a 15-year-old of the 1970s or ’80s.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So even though it may feel like everyone around me is “doing the deed” 24/7, we are actually participating in less sex than older generations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the reasoning behind this? Perhaps there are more romantics among us today who feel as I do and are more likely to give it some time. Or maybe people are generally less interested in dating earlier on. Or it may be that the definition of sex and intimacy has changed. It ultimately boils down to several factors, the center of it all being technology.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has changed the game. Sexting, snapchat sex, porn and all the resources the internet has to offer have joined forces to </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/6-ways-sex-is-different-between-gen-z-millennials-according-to-a-survey-16924538\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divert teens’ focus from physical sex to online sex.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the same time, technological advances and more resources mean that each generation is living longer, so having sex later on in your life may be a symptom of the “slow-life strategy,” discussed in the </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mentioned above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the study, this phenomenon fits into a larger trend of kids staying kids longer due to lengthened lifespans and </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more present parental supervision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s teens were found to be less likely to drive, work for pay, go on dates, have sex, or go out without their parents.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has affected sex in other ways. With so much to do on social media and streaming services, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more people prefer to stay in and use devices </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">instead of, say, go out to do drugs, drink alcohol and find partners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though statistics support this view of people our age, our campus appears to oppose the general data about Gen Z’s sexual habits. Could the reputation of UCSB’s social life create a concentration of people more interested in sex, alcohol and drugs, thereby exempting this population from a generalized claim? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be an interesting thing to think about, but in the end it should not affect the way you go about your life. I may have had my preconceived notions about casual sex and even taken a moral stance on it back then, but the fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.

Up until this point, the only definition of consent that I had ever heard was always “no means no.” Every conversation about consent seemed to end with this succinct summation.  But as a teenager navigating the complicated process of growing up, I learned that saying “no” is a lot easier said than done. A “no” does not always look or sound like someone simply saying “no.” Sometimes a “no” is silence. Sometimes a “no” is fear. Sometimes a “no” is a series of no’s that ended with a “fine.” I knew what consent was, but it was still hard to know whether or not I was truly giving it, because while I wasn’t saying no, I wasn’t exactly saying “yes” either. What I learned that day in class was that consent isn’t about saying “no,” it’s about saying “yes.” That day had a huge impact on how I view consent even now. And while I was so grateful to have had that education, I couldn’t help but wonder, what took so long? </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86872\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86872\" data-attachment-id=\"86872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/consent-lauren-orris/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=1660%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1660,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"consent : lauren orris\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86872\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris-203x250.jpg?resize=332%2C409\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=768%2C948&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?w=1660&amp;ssl=1 1660w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lauren Orris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, there hasn’t been much legislation surrounding consent. Federally, rape is illegal, and rape is defined as penetration without the consent of the victim. So while we have a definition of rape, we also need a definition of consent. This is where it gets dicey. Consent is defined differently in every U.S. state, but overall, each definition can be summed up as “no means no.” This changed in California in 2014 when </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill No. 967</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (codified as Section 67386 of the California Education Code) was signed into law. This law requires public schools to adopt policies and develop curriculum around affirmative consent in order to receive state funding. It’s affirmative: this law changed the definition of consent. Without affirmative consent there is pressure on the victim to resist, but sex should never involve resistance. The idea is that if someone wants to have sex, they will tell you, and before that happens, keep your hands to yourself. Consent is not the absence of a “no,” but the presence of a “yes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That brings us back to my senior year in a California public high school, and finally feeling like I just might understand what it means to actually say “yes.” But I don’t think we should wait until kids are having sex to talk to them about consent. Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk. Deciding who can touch your body and how does not always have to do with sex—it has do with choice and respect. Consent is not inherently sexual, and we have to stop treating it like it is. If consent was something we taught as early as pre-school, maybe kids would grow up into adults who understand what it means to ask for and to give consent. Luckily, some schools in the United States are doing just that. At </span><a href=\"http://www.lone-tree.k12.ia.us/video\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lone Tree Elementary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Iowa, they teach students consent in one of the simplest of ways: saying hello. Every morning the pre-schoolers greet each other and the kids may choose between a hug, a handshake, a high five, or a fistbump. This practice was originally put in place to encourage positive interactions between the students, but on a larger scale it teaches children to not only seek permission before touching someone, but also that it is okay to be explicit about what they want for themselves as well, even if it’s only the difference between a hug or a handshake. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem intuitive to establish consent between peers or strangers, I’d like to take it a step further and argue that it should be established between family members as well. It is often expected that young children hug or kiss grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. Of course, I think this is wonderful, but it is not uncommon for young children to resist or be uncomfortable with forced contact. I was certainly a stubborn child once who didn’t want to kiss my relatives, but eventually, I learned it was something that you just have to do, even if you don’t always want to. But by forcing even these most innocent interactions, it teaches children that they should do what is asked of them and their bodies, even if it makes them uncomfortable. It’s an act of assumption and it teaches a code of putting other people’s desires before your own. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that kids should never be encouraged to show physical affection to family members, but I am saying that even the small act of asking for consent (and respecting the answer) before hugging a child could have a long-term impact in teaching them what consent looks and feels like.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk.

With movements like </span><a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeToo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is a long overdue dialogue starting about what it means to truly say “yes.” I want to take it further and make it a conversation that isn’t just about sex, and isn’t just for teenagers and college students. Growing up, I found consent complicated, but it shouldn’t be. Perhaps if we grow up learning to respect one another and ourselves—by seeing and practicing affirmative consent in all facets of touch—then “yes means yes” could just be common sense and decency, rather than a complicated piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/college-sexual-assault\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will experience sexual assault in college. Based on the women I know in college, that number is much higher. This number only represents those who report, but think about how many don’t. For their own reasons—whether it’s fear, embarrassment, or not even realizing they were assaulted in the first place—so many stay silent. I have left sexual interactions feeling ashamed or hurt, but I couldn’t understand why. I never said no, after all. Sometimes it takes time (and really good friends) to recognize sexual assault when it happens, and that’s why we need to talk about it.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent wasn’t really a conversation in my life until late into high school, and even then, it was always in classes, and certainly never anything that was talked about within my family. It’s time to start having these conversations, because no one should ever touch or be touched without consent, and only “yes” can mean “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juliet Carter wants to talk about consent.  </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/","id":6386,"author":{"id":780,"name":"Juliet Carter"},"related":[6385,6384,6383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Great Sexpectations","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tinna-lam-sexpectations.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tinna-lam-sexpectations.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Max Hampton issues an important reminder that consent is always sexy!

I found out that many girls did not receive the thorough education I thought was necessary for success. Most girls simply repeated the golden rule: no teeth. But other than that, most advice was to “just kinda go for it.” When they reflected on their experiences, the consensus seemed to be that they didn’t believe this lack of education hindered their ability to perform or caused them any more anxiety than normal during their first experience. Personally, I think hindsight blurs the anxiety they felt preceding the act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued the conversation with my blowjob virgin friends, who all agreed that receiving a thorough how-to walkthrough would significantly decrease their anxiety. Most of these girls told me that they had gleaned what little knowledge they had from brief conversations with friends, or from articles in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the like. We discussed the merits of these articles and they told me how they didn’t feel like they could trust the information between the glossy pages of a national magazine when performing such an intimate act. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant.

Sex is such a popular topic in our culture; it’s used in advertisements to sell products, it’s shown in movies and music videos, it’s discussed in the media, news and politics.

On the other end of the spectrum, four girls had more than 30 partners and experienced orgasm less than 10 percent of the time (1-3 of their partners).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here’s more science to back me up. In the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Survey_of_Sexual_Health_and_Behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than 1000 adults were asked about their most recent sexual experience, and the results showed that 91 percent of the men climaxed during their encounter, compared to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only 62 percent of women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So is climaxing all that important during for women during sex? I asked the focus group, “Is orgasm necessary for you to consider a sexual experience good?” Most of their answers: No. “It’s fun and exciting for me to be intimate in general. I don’t have to reach an orgasm to enjoy the sex,” one participant explained. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is fine!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let’s compare this to how important it is for men to finish. If a guy doesn’t climax during sex, women often feel guilty. A lack of a male orgasm may be perceived as something being “wrong” with you or him. But when the roles are reversed its supposed to be “all good”?</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"86258\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/fuck-yourself-this-valentines-day/sex-toys-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=377%2C471&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"377,471\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sex toys 4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?fit=377%2C471&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-86258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4-200x250.jpg?resize=200%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?resize=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sex-toys-4.jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not going to bore you with the history behind this double standard or waste time right now explaining why women should orgasm just as much as men (they should, but that’s an entirely different article).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this lovey-dovey, card and chocolate crap-filled day, take the time to love yourself!

Sleepovers are riddled with questions like, “When will I lose my virginity?” or, “How did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lose your virginity?” These questions always plagued me, yet at the same time, they brought immense curiosity. As a queer woman, I have a lot of confusion and frustration with the word itself. Over time I’ve come to realize that virginity doesn’t even exist; by definition, it refers to the first time someone has sex, but sex can mean different things to different people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the occasions that I have found myself in a circle of friends, talking about virginity or how we lost it, more than one of the stories always seem to end with some statement like, “It went in and out like three times and then we were done.” Now, there is nothing wrong with this, and if both members felt like it was sex, then it was, because sex should be defined by the individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My issues with this only come in when queer women who have had sex with other women are considered virgins simply because they’ve never been penetrated. My girlfriend has been called a virgin by our friends because they don’t readily accept what we do as sex. So if my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.” Ultimately, sex is culturally defined by the presence of a penis, or at least some form of penetration, and this is just wrong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We often miss out on having those stories about our “first time,” because no one ever talks about what that would even look like. One of the things I heard about while I was growing up was “scissoring,” and I thought, “So, are we just supposed to smash our labia together until we both come in one simultaneous moment of bliss?” No, young Anabel, nobody does that. The next thing you might learn is that lesbians lose their virginity when they are eaten out. This sounds great, except men can eat out girls as well, so why are straight women who have only been eaten out still considered virgins?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s almost as if we’re agreeing that gay women really only get half the experience that straight women get, and as someone who has had sex with both men and women, that just doesn’t feel like the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s next? The strap-on. If you have just been fucked with a strap-on for the first time, most people would argue you have lost your virginity. But what about the person who wore it? I doubt that many people would consider that a loss of virginity for the giver. Truth be told, I don’t know how queer women lose their virginity with the cultural definition we currently hold, and that’s why the definition must change.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stated earlier that losing your virginity is defined by the first time a person has sex. This implies that in order to understand what that means, we must first decide what it means to have sex. My definition of sex is that it must be a consensual, intimate, vulnerable and, of course, sexual act. That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my straight friends, after having sex for the first time, reported that they didn’t feel any different. I myself reported the same thing after having sex with a man. This is probably because we had already had milestone-like experiences that were consensual, intimate, vulnerable and sexual that did make us feel different or changed. At least, I know this is the case for myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can pinpoint a couple times when I actually felt like I lost my virginity that don’t match the classic definition. It wasn’t the first time I had sex with a man, or the first time a girl ate me out, or even the first time I was fucked with a strap-on. I would say I lost my virginity the first time my girlfriend saw me naked and I felt my most vulnerable — but also my most beautiful. I could also say it was the first time I gave my girlfriend an orgasm, even if it was only with my hands. I could even argue that with each new partner I am losing my virginity over and over again, because I am learning to be vulnerable with someone new — just like how every kiss with a new person feels like my first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your moment is, the point is that it doesn’t matter. Sex is whatever it feels like it should be to you and your partner. Plus, virginity is made up anyway, so who really cares?       </span></p>\n<p><em>Anabel Costa wants Gauchos to define their own intimate experiences as they see fit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

I had transferred schools four times before then, and my middle school best friend had transferred to another school district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then this curly-haired, brown-eyed girl sat next to me in my second period Spanish class, and the only reality I had ever known flew out the fucking window. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me seven months to realize I was in love with her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came out to my parents three hours after that life-shattering realization. To my then-love, a year later. Most of my friends, 11 months after that. Slowly, one after another, the people in my life began to learn that I, Evelyn Spence, was attracted to women – even while I was still struggling to learn exactly what that meant. Bisexual? Pansexual? Queer? Lesbian? </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been four years, and I have slowly become comfortable with the blue, purple and pink that accompany the bisexual label. I have the bi colors in hearts in my Twitter bio, a rainbow emoji next to my name on Instagram and a photo of me sprawled out under a giant ass-inflatable rainbow as my Facebook profile photo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here’s the thing: I am 19 years old now, and I am Still. Coming. Out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come out every day: When I walk down the street with my bi-flag sweatshirt on and meet eyes with the stranger crossing the street, I come out. When I call my crush “babe” in front of the Starbucks barista, I come out. When I hold hands with a girl at the mall near my house, when I make gay jokes to those I’ve just met and when I clip my fifth queer pin to my backpack, I come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out is a jumble of emotions and tears and laughter and brings on more awkward conversations than I ever thought were possible. I have come out to many people in my 19 years, but there are still those who remain unaware of my rampant queerness, such as my grandmother, who will finally know after she reads this article, and the coming out will begin again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a huge difference between 15 and 19 – now, students of UCSB and beyond, I am proud to announce that I am no longer afraid of coming out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posting queer and bi posts on my Instagram and Twitter no longer bring out that uneasiness in the pit of my stomach. I no longer cover up my gay and bi shirts with black leather jackets; I send my father pictures of myself in front of rainbow flags; I scream “GAY!” in the street every time I see something remotely rainbow related. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I very recently visited the Castro District in San Francisco. I’m sure you can all guess how that went.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am no longer nervous to tell the world who I am, and that is the point I am trying to make in this article. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those still in the closet, to those with one foot in and one foot out, to those who are terrified to even to be associated with the rainbow, let me tell you that one day, you will be able to let go of that breath you are holding – and yes, I stole that partly from “Love, Simon,” but the point remains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I could’ve said that to my 15-year-old self.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This piece is a summary of my coming out, but this is also an open letter to all of you who are afraid; this is a letter to those of you who are scared to hold your love’s hand in the street and to those of you who cannot tell your parents who you are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I am speaking from a place of privilege. I was lucky enough to be born to a mother who knew I was queer two years before I did and a father who still loves me, even though I know he will never be at peace with what he believes is a “made-up” sexuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my parents, I say that in my 19 years I have met people who place themselves on all levels of the Kinsey scale. Nothing in life ever fits into a neat little box, so why should sexuality be the one that does? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you – if you do not have a support system at home, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you will find one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I have found a family with friends who celebrate my queerness. I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find those people. Even when it gets hard, even when you can’t breathe anymore, even when it feels like your life has become tragedy incarnate. It may take a while – it took me four years – but happiness is worth waiting for because one day, you will no longer be afraid of coming out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pinky promise. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence wants people to know that she is a HUGE fan of the rainbow emoji.

I am not kidding. Specifically, a very firm handshake. There’s something about seeing the other person naked and at their most vulnerable that makes me more comfortable with them afterwards. I wouldn’t necessarily identify it as a way to receive instant gratification because it isn’t; it’s just my preferred method of a fun icebreaker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most times it backfires. I’ve had people tell me after sex that what we’re doing is too fast or that they’re not looking for anything serious. But the thing is, I don’t think I’m going too fast, and maybe I don’t want anything serious as well. For me, sex isn’t an indicator of how developed a relationship is because I don’t think sex is that serious. It’s just my way of creating an initial bond. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had a guy break up with me once because I failed to offer him enough of a “chase.” This is understandable. For him the chase was the road that led up to the sex, but for me the chase was what we could have achieved even after the sex. I refuse to see sex as the pinpoint or climax (pun intended) of a relationship, and that’s part of the reason of why I do it first. How well can we connect with each other even after the fact? Can we do something more with our relationship?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think society puts too much pressure on sex to be this big, relationship-time-marker when it’s simply just a form of interaction.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before an old white dude can post in the comments section about what I should do with my body instead, let me tell you this: have you ever considered the idea that intimacy doesn’t always have to rely on sex? I’m not saying that sex isn’t sacred or special or important because it is all those things. What I’m saying is that there is a deeper form of bond and communication than sex, and to me, reaching this medium together is the chase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a different kind of thrill that comes with trying to find another, nonsexual way to bond after sex because the strongest forms of intimacy lie in actions that are the least sexual. I think society puts too much pressure on sex to be this big, relationship-time-marker when it’s simply just a form of interaction. I know that most people place more importance on sex than I do, but this is just how I view sex to be. Sex is just sex, and sex would be nothing but a daily happening if it weren’t for the heavy implications and taboo society imposes upon it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

Tinder is the stage on which you perform your grueling mating dance, and the sole audience member is you, clapping maniacally like Shia Labeouf.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For about an hour I digitally peacocked and scoured through matches. Sometimes people get straight to the point. They’ll ask you what you’re looking for on Tinder. Shamelessly, I had no good reason for being on this app: I had no end goal, no desire to fulfill an emotional or physical void, no interest in meeting the father of my future children. I was here to waste time. My bio? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like butter, meat, and your sense of humor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this glorious lowest common denominator bio I let it be known that I’m here to practice conversation and jab daintily at fragile masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be your manic pixie meme girl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come across a particular guy who checks off my three boxes: He </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) hasn’t call me a bitch yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) made an appropriate use of the sprout emoji. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) looks like he hasn’t shaved since the last presidential election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks like we have a winner! Let’s call him Brian. Brian and I meet up on DP for a stroll; it’s Deltopia and the happiness in the air is palpable (read: DP smelled like the devil’s lettuce). Brian tells me about his nerdy science stuff, makes very intentional eye contact as he tells me about his mission to cure cancer and save millions of lives, and tells me about his sweet family from North Carolina. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we walk the length of DP, he asked me if I’d like a massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be clear: if a stranger offers you a massage, you should probably take all necessary precautions and evaluate the risk vs. reward. Ask yourself the important questions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How good are you at martial arts? Do you have pepper spray? Could you overpower this potential attacker? Do you have a loyal dog who could accompany you? Do his hands even look strong enough to knead out the decades of trauma in your shoulders? Once you’ve jumped through those hoops, you can say yes to the massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far. I say “so far” because I’m not rich enough to dabble in Scientology yet. But I think I got a taste of what Tom Cruise probably feels like every day. I felt rebirthed: my arms became wings, I was given a new spine, every knot in my entire back from years of self-inflicted stress melted away. He whipped out an industrial sized bottle of organic lemon hemp lotion and pumped handfuls of the goop into his palms, slathering it across my shoulders. The lotion felt like mayo on my skin. I didn’t care. I wish he owned a pillow but who was I to complain? I should probably buy him a pillow for his service. I gained back four years of my life that day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He didn’t even want a massage in return, probably because my fingers look about as strong as vermicelli. A week later, I developed a weird rash on my back from the lotion, but to me they were only a sweet reminder of a glorious, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> massage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder. Most of us download dating apps to satisfy our personal needs for emotional or sexual gratification, to either meet friends or flings or future partners; until Deltopia weekend, I thought these were the only benefits to be reaped from this embarrassing app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should consider accepting a massage. You could ask for one if it wasn’t offered. You should consider giving someone a massage. A massage culture would bring a whole new meaning to “I Gaucho back.”  Maybe the massage will be so good you’ll want it to be more than a massage. Maybe, in the year 2045, the notion of being a good kisser will give way to the importance of giving great massages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matching with Brian’s massage skills was a stroke of serendipity: I know that not everyone will have the same luck I did. You might find an amateur who has not learned the full potential of his opposable thumbs; you may encounter a deviant who does little tickly motions that haunt you for weeks to come; you could even bump into a lazy boy who massages you for only a fleeting moment before complaining.
