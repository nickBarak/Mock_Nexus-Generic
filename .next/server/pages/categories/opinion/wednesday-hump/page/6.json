My hookup experiences have included both seeing stars and seeing the popcorn on the ceiling. Let’s improve the general standard, people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Be a good shacker — start your partner’s morning off right.” A little wake-me-up oral, mayhaps?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“If a person tells you up front that they don’t want a relationship, don’t be angry when they don’t want a relationship.” My roommate last year hooked up with a guy for seven months, hoping that he’d change his mind and be her boyfriend, to no avail. He was straightforward about his preferences and she wasted a lot of time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Don’t neglect the titties. Give them their due respect.” Before heading to Panty-Paradise, take a little detour and appreciate the mountainous terrain. They need a little loving. Additionally, appreciate that some men also love to have their chesticles pinched and nipped.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Know how to grab a tit. “Like a stress ball, but gently.” Don’t be the asshole that bats them from side-to-side like a sexually distressed kitten. I never want to go through that again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“If you can’t make yourself come, it’s incredibly unlikely that someone else will be able to. Practice self-love.” It might be awkward at first, but it’s important to understand what gets the loins a-frothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the ladies, “Remove your sticky boobs and extensions prior.” You don’t want them to think that their hot loving is literally disintegrating your body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Consent is not the absence of a no.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Don’t make your friends listen to your oral adventures.” If they want to hear that nastiness they’ll stir a pot of Mac and Cheese.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Try not to look at men’s sex faces. They can be absolutely terrifying.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“When you’re going down on a woman, use your fingers simultaneously.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Never hookup with a tampon in. It can become a nightmare scenario.  Just wait, it’s not worth it!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Invest in the high quality lube kids. Don’t sell yourself short.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Don’t let your virginity make you feel less than what you are. You’re high-hanging fruit.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Take time to be single and uncommitted. Learn what you like and don’t like and focus on yourself.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it!” Try some weird stuff. Dabble with your sexuality. You never know, you may open new doors for yourself. Just don’t start choking your partner if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could accidentally commit a crime (of <i>passion</i>!)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And so, your bright-eyed, bushy-tailed young’uns, go forth, go down and prosper!

There are literally thousands of people at this school who you can have whatever sort of freaky interactions you want with. The only people you are pretty much guaranteed to see everyday are your neighbors. Unless you enjoy the recurring head nod and wave of shame, leave your neighbors alone until they are no longer your neighbors. Another tip, develop a secret code with your roommates for when they should absolutely not come in. The sock-on-the-door-thing lost its subtlety before you were born, so don’t try to bring it back. A post-it on the door or a piece of tape over the lock will usually get the message across without advertising it to the whole floor. It can be tricky to get lucky in the dorms, but a little finesse and planning is all it takes.</p>\n<p>Dining Commons</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The single most important thing to know about the dining commons is that you can sit with anyone you know, even for just a little bit, so long as you are respectful of an ongoing conversation and aware that people sometimes need to sit alone. Pick up your yogurt and put it down next to anyone — perfect unassuming conversation starter for an easy 20 minutes of bonding. Even better, notice what your person of interest is eating and offer to take them to a restaurant that you “know” has the best whatever that thing is ever. Boom. Date one: Check. The rest is up to you.</p>\n<p>Welcome Week</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting times you’ll ever have. You’ll quickly find that you simultaneously know nobody and everybody. You’re a brand new person with a clean slate and this is the week to build your new reputation for the next four years of your life. This should excite you. You can be the Casanova, the Jock, the sweetheart, the lover, the shy one or the mysterious one. You can be anything, and the best part of it all — with so many new people to meet, you’ll have quite a few tries to get it right. Be confident. Everyone is as new as you. Relax, try new things, practice some old things and just be smart and safe when it comes down to it.</p>\n<p>Rec Center</p>\n<p>No matter what your body type is, the Rec Center can be a great friend to your love life if you know how to play the gym-going-game properly. Be restrained. The imagination is your friend when it comes to meeting a potential mate. Even if you have the picture-perfect body, don’t show it off too quickly. Half of the fun is finding out what’s underneath the shirt for the first time. Also, if you wear headphones, take them both out to talk to somebody. It shows you’re interested in more than looking. Lastly, don’t be afraid to introduce yourself to somebody, just make sure you don’t end up forcing yourself and your conversation on them when they’re trying to exercise. Read the signs — they’ll lead you home with a lovely companion.</p>\n<p>Class</p>\n<p>Both lecture and section are perfect places for making new acquaintances. If you sit by someone new, introduce yourself. That is, only if class has yet to start. Once the professor or TA starts speaking, stop talking. Don’t do it. You and your interest are both paying an insane amount of money per minute of class time, so take it seriously. An introduction before class and a quick conversation afterwards can lead a long way. Plus, referencing the lecture is an excellent icebreaker. “Can you believe there are over 300 species of squid in the world? On that note, let’s get weird.” Not a perfect example, but the principle is flawless. Use class as a place for brief introductions; leave the rest of the conversation for later.</p>\n<p>At the Beach</p>\n<p>This one is all about location: Choose where you lay out wisely. Stick near Santa Cruz if you’re looking for other freshmen, or venture down to Sands for some surfer eye candy. Bring something to spark conversation — a soccer ball, a volleyball or a six-pack … but you didn’t hear that from us … (seriously though, if you do this, do not go swimming. We don’t want your tickets or deaths on our hands). If you do get that cliché football landing on your towel, know that it was likely thrown on purpose, and have the confidence to throw it back and ask if you can join in. If you’re no Tom Brady, you could always ask him to show you how to properly finger those laces. And if you are the Tom Brady in this situation, pick a target and throw: It literally couldn’t be easier.</p>\n<p>In I.V.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this one may seem the most intimidating, but we can guarantee you that everyone is out there for the exact same reasons you are: To get drunk and meet people. Start conversations, and preferably get deeper than, “So what’s your major?” The key is to NOT be cliquey; it just makes you unapproachable (as does staring at your iPhone all night). You will have that one person that you stick to like glue, but think of them as more of a wingman than a hand-holder, and feed off of each other’s confidence rather than insecurities. If you need liquid courage, by all means, go for it. At least then you’ll have something to do with your hands. But don’t endlessly retreat to the keg just because it’s something to do rather than standing around awkwardly. If you drink to the point where you can’t take care of yourself, how do you expect to take care of that special someone else?</p>\n<p>At the Library</p>\n<p>Again, location is everything. It’s a big place, so try out a few different spots: You’ll get a feel for who sits where and then you can decide where you want to set up camp. Once you get your lib routine going, you’ll probably start seeing the same people, which is good. Then you can graduate to small talk. By no means am I telling you to interrupt someone’s studying, but if the opportunity arises, take it. Start with little things (“Hey, can you watch my laptop real quick?”) and keep your eyes and ears out for possible openings; maybe you’ll recognize a song that you can hear through their headphones, or they’ll be reading a book from a class that you’ve taken. Flirting at the library is definitely more of an art than these last two, but it can be done.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Opinion Co-Editors Emile Nelson and Allyson Campion would love to know if any of these tips actually work … Hit them up on Twitter @Nexus_Opinion.

potentially building or destroying a man’s reputation from behind a keyboard (<em>www.onlulu.com</em>). This website is available only to women, as it requires information from your Facebook to verify your sex, thus prohibiting the participation of men. Now, I fully understand why an app like this was created: Some girl probably got cheated on and said something along the lines of, “My fragile womanly heart has burst asunder! If only other women knew the scheming cruel ways of Bobby Whatshisface!” Were these the good old days, she would’ve drenched his possessions in gasoline, lined them up in the yard to spell “ballface” or “douchenozzle,” and then lit them up like the Fourth of July. But nowadays, such a simple act of rebellion does not seem to go far enough in sending a message to the world.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We live in an age where everything we do is permanently stored on the internet. That dorky MySpace profile picture where you had braces and wore your pants too high? It’s up there. That video where you tried to do a sexy dance and instead ended up totally eating it? It’s somewhere in the bowels of the web … or, if you’re really unlucky, on the front page of YouTube. And your romantic endeavors, gross habits and/or traits you’d hoped would never leave the bedroom? Yep. If you’re a man, these, too, are readily available to the public eye thanks to Lulu. Guys, be afraid … be very afraid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The entire purpose of this app is to reveal a guy’s ranking — on a scale from one to ten, based on an average provided by your female friends, crushes, hook-ups and ex’s — to ladies of the world. It also has hashtags to summarize you into the basest form. #Experienced, #RespectfulToWomen or #StrongJaw are some of the positive traits you might have. While #NapoleonComplex, #LoserFriends and #BoringInBed might be some of your more negative ones. And if you have a Facebook, you are on Lulu. There’s no escape. My DAD is on Lulu. Luckily, my breakfast will stay safely in my stomach as he hasn’t been rated (though you’ll always get a 10 in my books, Pops).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now imagine you’re me, and you’re venturing on to the website for the first time. Immediately you see profiles for your little brother, your boyfriend and all your closest friends. You read them, curious. And you want to blow chunks. A.) I don’t need to know my little brother is a #SexPanther. B.) I don’t want to read about how my boyfriend is #KinkyInAllTheRightWays. Of course he’s kinky and scrumptious, but I don’t need to hear it from anonymous chicks on the internet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It was filthy the way that everyone was rated as a number, and how everything about them was sorted into simple hashtags. I don’t love them for their number and I don’t see them for just their hashtags … but Lulu does. And if my little brother falls for a girl in the future and she decides to look him up on Lulu before their date, she’s going to spend the whole time thinking about his hashtags, judgments fully formed before so much as talking to him. She’ll look specifically for those attributes and faults, and when he does something that matches his description, she’ll feel like everything on the page has been validated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gauchos, you’re a smart bunch; naturally, you know that each relationship is different. What my boyfriend was to one girl is not what he is to me. He may even change because of me — his habits, his interests, his ideas. Sure, I’ve been burned before, and although I wanted to egg this dude’s house and write something scathing on Lulu (he had no ratings yet, but ohhhhhh…), I didn’t. I didn’t because it really hurt me to see how strangers talk about the people I love on that site. The people who may one day love him don’t deserve a punch in the gut from me, and if I can prevent doing that, I will. Think about it: if you were interested in someone, even if there was real potential for something great, someone else’s spiteful review could fill you with doubt and insecurity that is not your own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ladies, you’re not protecting other women. You’re venting. Maybe you didn’t get closure. Or maybe you still want to express things to this guy but can’t find the courage. So instead, you passive-aggressively give them a number, diminish their whole lives into a few hashtags and smile to yourself knowing that his romantic prospects will forever be able to read your biased notes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But even if this guy just dropped an emotional deuce on you and you feel like you’re doing the female population some sort of justice, I have news for you: You are being a bully. You are no better than they are and you’re not just hurting them, but those who care about them. Would you want to be the cyber-equivalent of a kid shoving another kid’s face in mashed potatoes? Of course not, yet this is worse because it will stay with them forever, just like your embarrassing MySpace picture. And you’re not even teaching them a lesson for having hurt you — you’re doing it all anonymously. How are they supposed to know what their punishment is for if they can’t even know your name? Just try to put yourself in their place for a moment. People you trust, people who were your lovers or “friends” (and by the way, I sort of understand the pissy ex’s, but if you are ranking a friend you are toe scum; friends don’t do that) are exposing you to the world through nothing more than a number and list of pros and cons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If action isn’t taken against Lulu, it’s only a matter of time before there is a male equivalent. Right now it exists by word of mouth in places like locker rooms, bars and dorms, where towels are rat-tailed and there’s talk of “tapping that.” But soon they could be detailing your nastiest girl habits and that weird thing you did in bed (even if it was just that once) for the whole guy-world to see.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We’re in college. This is our time to run free and naked and sow our eggs like it’s Easter Sunday. Do you really want any guy out there to be able to look you up and find out you #LikeItInTheButt? They’d have your cup size, how many dates it takes you to put out and whether or not you get attached. And not to generalize, but I imagine men would be inclined to be a tad more explicit with their posts on your page. Also, I imagine brushing these things off would be more complicated than just giving a little giggle or the standard “oh my god, guys are so stupid” shrug.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So kids, obey the golden rule — “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” — and avoid the urge to go on Lulu. Even if it seems more convenient to have all the answers readily available to you, be an adult and formulate your own opinions on the people you meet. Party on, Gauchos, and happy (undocumented) humping!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. doesn’t want to know how kinky you were, she wants to know how kinky you are. #learnsbydoing</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Traditionally, women are expected to be groomed, cleaned, styled, primped and prepared from eyelash to toenail. Consider women’s hairstyles alone: there’s the length, color, style and occasional accessory. Ladies will spend countless hours in front of the damned 360-degree full-length mirror, perfecting their reflections until they feel like someone off the latest cover of <em>Vogue</em> … and that’s just for a quick trip to the DLG. Obviously, this is an exaggeration, but the clothes we wear, the makeup we put on and what perfume we use are all factors that are being analyzed each time we leave the house.</p>\n<p>Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to get laid. Generally speaking, men have a much shorter list of things they have to do to get a partner’s attention, but that doesn’t mean that these few things aren’t just as vital. For the guys who have either mastered the outdoorsy vibe that drives some people wild, have guitars strapped to their backs or drive Bugattis, water through the hair and the occasional shave will suffice.

It’s as basic as asking a store clerk, “Hey, do these fit?” Pick something simple that works for you; less is almost always more. I know the end goal is to get someone in your pants, but if you can literally fit them inside while still wearing said pants, it might be time to go for a slimmer fit. That being said, make sure your jeans aren’t so tight that they cut off circulation to the parts that need it most – find a happy medium so you can make your medium happy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Clean Up, So You Can Clean Up</p>\n<p>Basic rule of thumb: If your grandmother wouldn’t approve of your living conditions, chances are, neither will your partner. Do the dishes, pick up your dirty clothes (or at least hide them well), hell, maybe you could even do your laundry. Basically, if your place is so dirty that you don’t want to be there, what makes you think that your partner is going to feel any different?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do the ’Do or Chop the Mop</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much time to throw some type of product in your hair to at least make it look like you tried. With great hair comes great responsibility. And if you simply can’t muster up the energy to show it the respect it deserves, throw on a tasteful hat (three-gallon maximum). If long hair is too much of a commitment and you just can’t find the right hat, don’t be afraid to get your buzz on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If I Can Taste It, It’s Too Much</p>\n<p>Once the previous steps have helped you get a date, don’t expect that the smell of your Irish Spring bar soap is going to wow them into your arms. Using soap is a great start, don’t get me wrong, but once you’re out of the shower, a spray or two of something that doesn’t come in a can will definitely give you an advantage. Ditch the Axe and invest in a glass bottle. But make it last – use sparingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be Minty Fresh</p>\n<p>Few things are more disappointing than getting excited and intimate, only to inhale your partner’s dinner breath. No one wants sloppy seconds from your egg salad sandwich. Brush your teeth, eat a mint, chew some gum or use mouthwash … we really don’t care. Keep your dinner a mystery and you just might get dessert.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chivalry: Back with a Vengeance</p>\n<p>Okay, so it’s old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining armor. Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody. Go the extra mile so that they will too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If these ideas sound scary or revolutionary, you’re probably the guy who has the most to learn from them. These are pretty simple concepts and although there’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get some, I can just about promise you that if you neglect to follow these steps, the odds will never be in your favor.</p>\n<p><em>Haley K. never leaves the house without a fresh mani/pedi, a double coat of lip gloss, the perfect balance of bronzer and blush, and exactly seven spritzes of Daisy by Marc Jacobs. </em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of the June 26, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Yet in our society, women are still expected to remain chaste. But to be clear, it’s just women; men are generally raised to view their virginity as a burden, giving them reason to explore and act upon their sexuality.</p>\n<p>For many women, religion serves as the primary force keeping them from having sex. Some ultimately decide that God will not hate them for having premarital sex. However, Jenny, a third year (all names have been changed), was raised Mormon, so the influence of religion was much stronger. “[In my religion,] sexual immorality is second to murder,” she said. “I had to keep it a secret from my friends and family.” Her guilt didn’t come from her deflowering, but instead from the fear of disappointing others.</p>\n<p>Others said that factors aside from the physical act of having sex were what later led to regret. “I felt a bit like chewed bubblegum afterwards,” Marisa, a third year, said. “Not because I wasn’t ready or I didn’t do it right, but because I didn’t match that pure idea of myself that my parents and church gave me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jenny expressed a sentiment that many others agreed with: “I felt I built it up a lot more than I should have,” she said. “It wasn’t as big of a deal as I thought.”</p>\n<p>That’s not to say virginity isn’t important: Losing it in a special manner can establish healthy habits for your future love life. But as Claire, a second year, stated, “If you want to make it a big deal in your life, go for it. But don’t assume that’s the case for other people and don’t judge them for what they’ve done and their feelings towards virginity.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to women who are still virgins, the perceived stereotypes can be equally frustrating. “Either you’re religious or some sort of square,” Julie said.</p>\n<p>“It defeats your connections most of the time. [People think that] if we can’t have sex, we can’t have a relationship,” Claire said.</p>\n<p>Many virgins agreed that upon meeting the right person, they would be ready to lose it, which brings up another point: Why is “losing” your virginity the accepted terminology? Losing has a negative connotation, implying that upon sharing the act with someone, you are left without something valued and important; you are less than you were. Women are constantly told that their virginity is a gift, yet feel that they can’t pursue their sexual desires until they “lose it” appropriately. Yet even after they do, they are constantly burdened by the idea of “their number,” Julie said. If it exceeds a certain range, it’s a point of embarrassment; if it’s comparable to that of a man, it’s shameful.</p>\n<p>The shame goes to a whole new level in foreign countries like Turkey, where virginity is a representation of the family’s honor as well as of the idea that the woman’s body belongs to her husband. According to Human Rights Watch, Turkish women are subjected to virginity examinations prior to marriage, and though technically allowed to refuse, they are pressured by both their family and the police to consent. If the hymen is broken, the woman is deemed a non-virgin, unfit to marry and is often subjected to ridicule and abuse by her family and community. It doesn’t matter if the hymen was broken by doing the splits or taking a horseback ride; if it’s broken, you’re shamed.</p>\n<p>According to Solomon Rothmon, a writer at Yahoo! Voices, proof of being unchaste is also a valid reason for a woman to be permanently expelled from the formal education system. In the face of this immense pressure, many women commit suicide prior to their examination in hopes of saving face.</p>\n<p>The extremist views continue to shock … Human Rights Watch also reports that if a Turkish man sexually assaults a woman, he can get out of the charges if he marries his victim. Oftentimes this is something families will push for to avoid humiliation, leaving their daughter, sister or niece to live out their lives with someone who violated them.</p>\n<p>Even in America, where such laws would be considered a heinous affront to our liberties, the perceptions Americans hold can still be just as damaging.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really dangerous for women’s self-esteem and self-worth and for how they feel about themselves generally,” Jenny said. “It’s sad that sexual acts or lack of them can be harmful to your emotional state … People get so confused by an identity that doesn’t matter. It’s no one’s business and if people choose to judge virgins or non-virgins harshly based on their gender, then fuck you!”</p>\n<p>Seeing the stark differences among cultures highlights the idea that virginity is a social concept. But is that concept still relevant? America is asking women to fulfill contrasting ideas: “be the virgin” and “be the sexpert.”</p>\n<p>As varying sexualities and habits enter the public eye, what still constitutes sex? Is oral sex considered sex? Is mutual masturbation? Does using a toy constitute as sex? What about lesbians? A male organ will never penetrate them, so does that mean they are “doomed” to be virgins forever? If these things are not considered sex, then we perpetuate the notion of “everything-but” virgins, sexual beings who have not yet taken what we consider to be the final step.</p>\n<p>It is disturbing that someone’s identity can depend so heavily on something that eventually happens to everyone. It’s unfair that women are the only ones shouldering this burden. We need to accept that the ideas that held up before do not necessarily hold up today. Virginity is a social construct, and an outdated one at that.</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. puts the “jazz” in vajazzle.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1511392043\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51596\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/humpin-for-the-first-time-the-ins-and-outs-of-virginity/tomydate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=450%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"450,675\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"tomydate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=450%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51597\" alt=\"tomydate\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the May 29, 2013 print version of the<em> Nexus.</em></h6>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

You may be lying blissfully in bed when your partner of x-months asks you timidly, “So, are we exclusive?” Don’t panic. Don’t push them away. Don’t think, “God, there’s the end of a good thing.” I am all for being casual, if that’s what you want. And I absolutely agree that labels can be harmful to your relationship if they are forced or both members aren’t prepared for them. But labels are not something to overreact about. Rather, they are something that should be earnestly considered. You all have your varying notions on reasons for shunning or embracing labels and I’m going to address them as best I can. Sit tight.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, labels provide parameters and a good gauge of emotional investment. So often, people remain tight-lipped about what they’re actually feeling. It’s like a competition for who can be the most casual, or care the least. So, it’s ridiculously difficult to gauge whether or not your partner is taking you seriously or really likes you. Thus, the importance of labels. Bear with me.</p>\n<p>The talks you have with your partner will vary depending upon your relationship. I personally cannot stand the idea of dating someone for six months and having them still be only your “hookup buddy.” That’s half a year. That’s bullshit. If that’s all they’re keeping you for, they are not taking you seriously. And maybe you’re okay with that, and you want to keep it there. But if you’re emotionally attached, you need to prioritize what you want out of the relationship. I had to watch my friend put her partner’s feelings over her own for months. She wanted to be this relaxed, casual girl for him and, in doing so, she refused to tell him what she actually wanted. If you want something, tell them. Your partner is not a mind reader. When I was three weeks or so into dating my boyfriend, I asked him whether he considered our relationship casual or if he saw it going anywhere. If he said casual, that would have been a bummer, but at least I would have known and I would have been able to behave appropriately. That is the preliminary label you need to jump over. Know what they want out of your relationship so you don’t moon over them pointlessly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Later comes the exclusive/girlfriend line dance. After a loud and heated debate with a pack of dudes, I think I have a fair idea of the struggle between these terms. When deciding whether to remain exclusive or making their partner a girlfriend, the guys saw it as a pointless transition. It wouldn’t change anything; they already considered their partners at the level of girlfriend and didn’t understand the difference in connotation. However, the way I view it is like this: a girl you’re exclusive with is certainly close to girlfriend status. But being a girlfriend signifies that you are ready to open yourself up emotionally. Exclusive means you don’t have to worry about whether they’re dipping their chip into someone else’s dip or not. But girlfriend means that they’ll tell you about their childhood, their disappointments, their secrets and the extent of their feelings for you. It’s taking the next emotional step. And if there really is no difference, what’s holding you back from just saying it? If nothing really changes, what’s the problem? It will make them happier and there is the opportunity for more emotional satisfaction. I’m not the kind of person who will wait around months just to be a slam piece, and neither should you. Take yourself seriously and tell others what you want from your romantic endeavors or accept that it will sit still as long as you let it. Deuces, and happy humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. ain’t no holla’ back girl.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"73712067\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51518\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51519\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/casualornot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg?fit=990%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"990,615\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"casualornot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg?fit=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg?fit=888%2C552&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51519\" alt=\"casualornot\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot-250x155.jpg?resize=250%2C155\" width=\"250\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg?resize=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg?w=990&amp;ssl=1 990w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the Wednesday, May 22, 2013 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51518\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51518\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/if-you-like-it-put-a-label-on-it/","id":6349,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6348,6347,6346],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"To Hump or Not to Hump?

Kudos to you if the office adventure blossoms into a beatific bond, but try to steer away from potential gossip and awkward encounters in a place in which you wish to excel professionally.</p>\n<p>His: Ask yourself one question: Is there a future for you where you’re working? If yes, you two are probably going to be seeing each other everyday for years to come, so don’t get sensual. But if you’re just working at the local McDonald’s while you’re home for summer, and she’s giving you the signs … ain’t nothing wrong with a little bump ‘n grind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Friends</p>\n<p>Hers: Ah, this one can get sticky. Have a feel — actually, have a good grope — for your pal’s “friends with benefits” mindset. Set guidelines. Unless you don’t give a flying fuck how your relationship with the amorous amigo turns out post-naughtiness, then be sure you differentiate emotional intimacy from skin-timacy. Have fun, but know what you want. Sometimes seeing the banging buddy get along well with your friends and family can shoot you straight into a world of feelings and attachment. And that, my reader, is when the stickiness doesn’t wash off.</p>\n<p>His: If she’s close enough to know your family dog’s name is Harvey Dent, you would have to gamble your friendship on whether or not you two will work as a couple. Chances are you will not be able to have casual sex with that kind of pre-existing emotional attachment; you’ll either become a great couple or just an awkward pair of people who have now seen each other naked and don’t know how to feel about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Date</p>\n<p>Hers: The questions I would ask are: “How horny are you?” and “How inhumanly irresistible is your date?” I must admit that I’ve committed the first date love-makin’ once before. The relationship that ensued was beautiful, but the physicality diluted the mental connection we shared. So let’s make this a no-no. If you want that bod, just ask for the bod. If you can’t get that bod, then that’s not my problem.</p>\n<p>His: Unless you’re 2 Chainz and you “love bad bitches” and that’s your “fuckin’ problem,” you’ll most likely agree that it’s risky to light the candles and whip out the Marvin Gaye on day one for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p>1. Sleaze factor: You can’t help but wonder that if she’s ready for me on day one, who else is getting this kind of treatment?</p>\n<p>2. The Natural Order: It’s much easier to become friends before the first hump than it is to try to go back and get to know each other afterwards. You might feel satisfied, but you’ll probably never know if she shares your love for Batman.</p>\n<p>Just think if you’re in it for tonight or tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Party</p>\n<p>Hers: For me, kissing competency is a huge turn on or off factor. Slobber fest in my mouth? Good bye and good riddance. But for the others who don’t predestine their party sexcapades by an oral ultimatum, I say, “Why not?” Check for lumps and sores, make sure the condom is on, and let your inner beast free.</p>\n<p>His: It’s rare to hear people say, “thank god for what I did last night” after a sloppy hookup in I.V. Don’t ruin your reputation over a drunken, possibly infectious and probably terrible one-nighter. Unless you’re just out looking for a crazy night and sure that you won’t be leaving with any new diseases, I say keep it safely stowed. That is, of course, unless you’re 2 Chainz.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: There’s a reason why you two broke up in the first place. Hold firm and demand some respect for yourself; there are plenty of other (better) fish in the sea. Unless you both have engaged in major self-improvement, chances are that if the relationship didn’t work the first time, it won’t work the second. But if you’re not trying to get back at what you let go and all you want is a thrustin’ thrill, just keep in mind that he’s filling you now, but he don’t fulfill you.</p>\n<p>His: Think of yourself and your ex as pieces of silly putty. No matter how many times you separate, as soon as you touch each other new strings of connected putty are going to try to hold you two together. Unless you definitely want to get back together, or you love a dramatic lifestyle, don’t mix your putty with putties of the past.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Best Friends’ Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: I see no problem in this. If you’ve got the feels for your homie’s ex — and these are real feels, mind you — then go for it. Communicate with your bestie, gauge her reactions, be sensitive toward her thoughts and if the green’s a-go, you press that gas pedal. As they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. It wouldn’t be fair to discriminate against the treasure based on who it first belonged to, now would it?</p>\n<p>His: If you’ve got an itch that nothing but your best friend‘s ex can scratch, talk to your friend, think about the awkwardness and finally consider the fact that your best friend spent a good deal of time riding that very same rollercoaster that you’re now waiting in line for. Hopefully by the time you’ve pondered these things, you’ll have realized that it is just a god-awful idea. If you’re still like “Meh, I bet it’d be just fine,” you’re ignorant. Don’t be stupid.</p>\n<p><em>R. Pengsta and E.

There’s a damn good chance someone is going to see your ass bobbing up and down in the lewdest of ways. You’re at your most vulnerable, naked and writhing, and the possibility that you could be reprimanded is high. The adrenaline is intoxicating. Not only that, but I adore the spontaneity of it: your partner can’t wait to get home to mash your nasties together and simply must have you on the grass, right here, right now. That hunger, that deviousness, that breathless giggling — these are the most delicious aspects of public sex. However, like all adrenaline-inducing activities, it’s always good to have a game plan. So, below, I entail my recommendations for your racy romp, particularly focusing on locale, with other kernels of knowledge littered throughout.</p>\n<p>Finding a proper place is perhaps the most important and trying aspect of sex away from home. It has to be an appropriate balance of being risky and concealed. “If you are for sure going to be caught, that’s scary. I doubt I could get it up. But with a little bit of risk, that’s fun,” said one lewd friend to another. I do not recommend the beach. Sure, it sounds romantic, but do you really want sand in your crevices? Just imagine a handful of tiny, salty rocks in your cooch. Sorry ladies, but that sand is not going to blossom into a beautiful pearl one day. That stuff will rub and chafe and cut as your partner pokes your insides. It can lead to infections, and it’s just not cute. What I think you really want from beach sex is to hear the crashing of the waves: que romantico. Below is a comprehensive list of all the places I would recommend …</p>\n<p>The Library (Obviously):</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is on everyone’s to-do-him/her list. Let the record show that if you do it in the bathroom where you can lock the doors (ahem, Dylan), it doesn’t count, and I decree your boning null and void. Well, save for the joy of insertion, props to that. It must be an open space, wherein anyone could see your moon-pale ass.

Instead, try one of Isla Vista’s many poorly-lit parks. Maybe bring a blanket and “enjoy the cool night air.” Or, even better, the bluffs. Not only will it be private (in case the thought of being caught makes you too nervous to perform) but you can listen to the waves intermingle with your partner’s erratic breathing. Let me just add, however, that a confidant of mine recommended not to do it on the bench by Window-to-the-Sea.

Similar to the thrill of library sex, you can make the double-backed beast atop the halls of academia with less of a risk and more of a note of novelty. This may be the top of the Life Sciences building, the top of HSSB or any other building that you can get-it-on-top-of.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more specific to my freshman frolickers, try behind San Miguetto, on the side facing Manzanita.

This means saying what you like, how you like it, when you like it, where you like it and not being afraid to be the initiator and get specific with your boy.</p>\n<p>Sexy-sneak-attack him next time he walks in the door: put on some of his favorite lingerie, tackle him onto your bed (counter, table, couch, floor — the list goes on), proceed to take off said lingerie and then do all those things that you said you’d save for his birthday. He’ll be living the dream, and I bet you he’ll do his best to make sure you feel the same.</p>\n<p>Then, when it’s his turn, tell him if all he’s doing is bouncing around like a kid in a Jolly Jump. I promise you that it’s better to say in the moment, “That’s not doing anything for me; put your back into it.” If you wait for him to look up one time and see you staring blank-faced at the clock, counting minutes while he’s busy thinking he’s blowing your mind (sore subject), you’re only losing out on your own pleasure and destroying his manhood.</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to say is you need to be completely naked in each sense of the word every time you show up to play with your man, or it will definitely be embarrassing for one of you, probably him. A combination of insecurity and shame does not make a night one to remember, for the right reasons at least.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Bring Beer.</p>\n<p>Although beer is the golden blood of happiness and does actually make the world go round, I don’t mean that you can make him happy just by bringing him beer (certainly helps, though). On this one I mean you need to think about what you bring to the table when push comes to shove. If you’re not doing the pushing or the shoving, you need to seriously reevaluate your sexual tactics.</p>\n<p>Basically, take into consideration that guys need to feel like they’re being taken care of — not babied, but taken care of.</p>\n<p>Part 3: Batman.</p>\n<p>Remember his fantasies. Chances are that your man is not Christian Grey and does not dream of tying you to a telephone post while using some medieval torture device to get off. However, if Mr. Grey is actually your man, then please disregard this section.</p>\n<p>Every single boy has dreams of different freaky ways he wishes he could get it on and most of them are harmless and exciting. The problem is that far too often, these fantasies are disregarded because the act itself is “good enough.” I’m here to tell you that if you let him wear his Batman mask and talk in the Dark Knight’s voice as he explores your Batcave with his Batmobile, you will have given that man a memory to be cherished until the end of time.</p>\n<p>All I want to say on this one is, take his fantasies into consideration next time you are trying to enjoy yourselves, and I’m sure he’ll remember it the next time he has the opportunity to return the favor.</p>\n<p>Men are not impossible to figure out; take care of them and they’ll take care of you.</p>\n<p><em>E.

I dream a dream of perfectly mowed, or at the very least nicely trimmed, meadows in the pants of men everywhere. Yes, you young rapscallions, you, today we will be discussing the importance of manscaping. About damn time.</p>\n<p>If you are a man, you may wonder: when should I trim the ball-fro? A rule of thumb: If you’re going to show it, mow it. Your most sensual apex should be a metaphorical front lawn. Don’t be the scary man down the street whose home is lost in the undergrowth. The one that requires the local EMTs to hack down the grass with a machete to cart out your critically sex-starved body … OK, I’ll admit I got carried away with that metaphor. Just remember you want the yard to look nice.</p>\n<p>I recommend having your crotch trimmed. If you are a generally hairy guy, don’t shave it. Imagine going to the zoo and seeing a gorilla. Now imagine that gorilla has crudely shaved only its genitalia. Take that horror and ponder it for a moment. A trim will suffice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for the rest of it, I’d say, anywhere you want licked should be shaved.

When it grows back it will prickle and tickle your sensitive giblets. Remember, waxing will mean a) that you won’t have to maintain it for at least a month and b) it will grow back thinner and softer than before. It is a choice only you can make. Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>If you do opt to shave, I recommend the proper set of tools: a good razor dedicated solely to your bits. There is something dehumanizing about shaving your face with a razor that has a pubic hair on it. If you want to be well-prepared, buy Coochy Cream (*insert rambling dialogue by spokesperson of Coochy Cream*). This is a shaving cream dedicated solely to handling your nether-lands. It permits you to shave against the grain which may be easier and it limits shave bumps. Consider it a sexual investment, my friend.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone cares about this stuff. You can adjust according to your partner. Perhaps you’ll land someone who likes the springyness of your bush and has made peace with the initial digging that must occur.</p>\n<p>And ladies, though you are generally better versed in this song and dance, remember that the same rules apply. At the very least, you should maintain your bikini line. Communication is key, people. If you want it from your partner, you need to ask, tactfully. I recommend one of two options that work for me. You can: A) ask if they want something like that from you. It opens the door and makes it reciprocal. “Hey, what are your preferences for how I keep it down there? Do you want it shaved? You do? OK, would you mind doing the same for me?” Or B) “Hey, I think it would be really sexy if you were bare down there …” Mention it offhandedly, flirtatiously. “Imagine all the things we could do …”</p>\n<p>And so, my little horny toads, I leave you with this applicable quote from one of my role models, Dr. Evil of Austin Powers: “There’s nothing quite like a shorn scrotum … It’s breathtaking … I suggest you try it!”</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has better things to do than look for a needle in a haystack.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of the Wednesday, April 24, 2013 print edition of the<em> Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/","id":6353,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6352,6351,6350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Snowflakes, It’s Time to Explore Your Shades of Gray","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This week: “alternative” sexualities and how completely normal they are.

This approach remains a sore subject for me, which is why I think it’s important to take a closer look at how people come to adopt the binary-driven concepts that color our generation’s zeitgeist. I often wonder how people look at the sheer complexity of our world and see any sort of binary. How people are presented with the vast proverbial “gray area” that permeates our Earth, the almost complete lack of “black and white” answers to anything, and still manage to exhibit racism, homophobia, transphobia or what have you, is a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>In fact, the more I study biology, the more I see this “proverbial grayness” present itself in the very building blocks that make up what we know about life. Nothing in biology (at least that I’ve studied so far) amounts to a pure black and white dichotomy. Nothing I’ve studied — from gene interactions to protein-binding events and metabolic pathways — has ever seemed to be a “one or the other” sort of interaction. Individual proteins bind fleetingly fast and at varying strengths; gene regulations occur at tiny timescales and regulate miniscule protein concentrations according to a vast array of environmental factors; metabolic pathways can involve hundreds, if not thousands, of intermediate molecules whose individual concentrations are controlled highly effectively in tandem, and again, at ridiculously small timescales. Thousands of chemical interactions within the body are paired with a thousand more, and those thousands are coupled with yet more. The body is in constant flux, and during development there are so many factors that affect how an organism will grow, learn and interact with the world around it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In light of life’s complexities, it’s shocking that anybody would think so deterministically about anything regarding human psychology. Sexuality and the huge variance that can be seen in human sexual preferences are both results of the intricacy of human development.</p>\n<p>As small children we are constantly told that everyone is a unique and special snowflake and that no two people in the world are ever exactly the same. Well, if everyone is as special and unique as they say, then it really shouldn’t be surprising that the special snowflake you met at that party last weekend can only reach orgasm if she licks another snowflake’s eyeball at climax (it’s called “oculingus,” look it up). If you’ve never heard of oculingus, it’s likely because uncommon and “weird” sexualities get swept under the rug. Just as we don’t berate people for liking the color pink, we shouldn’t make pariahs out of people who do things in the bedroom that we’ve never heard of.</p>\n<p>In researching for my articles I spend all too much time on the internet, and in doing so, I get to read a whole lot of sex columns and bedroom horror stories. Now, reading sex stories from strangers on the internet certainly doesn’t give me a Ph.D. in developmental psychology, nor does it make me a “sexpert.” But it does give me just enough perspective to realize that the variance between peoples’ sex lives and tastes is not only fascinating but beautiful and should be free to be explored by all.</p>\n<p>I’m not a neurobiologist (yet) but in the humble opinion of this biology student-turned-opinion writer, it will be through the study and understanding of neural development that we will ultimately come to know just how complex we are as humans.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration’s decision to invest in the mapping of the human connectome, a feat dubbed “The next great American project,” is sure to yield many answers to fundamental questions about the brain. I think one of these fundamental answers will concern the origin of human sexuality. Ultimately, though, what a roadmap of the human brain will show us is that there are so many different paths to reach the end goal of becoming a grown human being. Thus the idea of treating someone differently because they have sex with other dudes, like dressing in drag or play to a different gender than their physical appearance suggests will seem ludicrous.</p>\n<p>I like to end with calls to action, so I encourage you all to do two things. First, don’t be afraid to explore your own sexualities. Second, don’t be afraid to explore other peoples’, either. You might think it’s weird at first, but when your new partner asks you to lower yourself into that swing for the first time, please don’t forget the ball-gag.</p>\n<p><em>Luc Gendrot embraces, never erases, his computer’s browsing history.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the Wednesday, April 17, 2012 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50881\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50881\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/snowflakes-its-time-to-explore-your-shades-of-gray-on/","id":6345,"author":{"id":456,"name":"Luc Gendrot"},"related":[6344,6343,6342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Get It Girl: Helping the 70 Percent Find Their “Oh”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Not screaming euphoric hallelujahs during intercourse, ladies?

And then, yes, some may be blessed with that practiced partner or just a very patient lover who can stroke or lick them to satisfaction. But the rest of us 70 percent-ers (unlucky souls who have to deal with a steep and promising build-up, only to come to the stomach-dropping realization that no, we won’t be getting off tonight) know that once he is done, the whole sex session is done.</p>\n<p>It’d be nice to say that there really shouldn’t be any reason as to why 70 percent of women don’t reach orgasms during their sex-ventures, but that would be a lie. Of course there are reasons, and I’m going to break some down for you:</p>\n<p>1. Girls take much longer to orgasm. Come on, we all know this. Unless the lady pal sports some seriously sensitive sensors, which could, mind you, be both a blessing and a curse, the man must be mentally prepared to spend anywhere from 10 to 30 to 60 minutes on their woman, depending on multiple factors such as the guy’s skill, the girl’s arousability and the level of communication. It’s an investment, yes, but hey, it’s worth it. (Although, I’d like to note that when you please your women, males—and females!—of this planet, they are much more likely to reciprocate your well-spent time and effort. And that could mean many, many things.)</p>\n<p>2. Now I’m not saying this applies to all women, but quite a few of them won’t speak their minds. Maybe it’s due to societal pressure or expectations. Maybe it’s something fostered from the get-go, from 5th grade education on menstrual cycles to 7th grade sex-ed. Guys are more accepted as the Dora Explorers of their sexual preferences and expression of their sexual needs (ironically, I use a female reference). Why is this the case, especially since a lot of men find it hot when their women tell them what to do or take initiative to show how they turn themselves on, and consequently become hard, ready and very much on fire themselves? But that’s exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>3. Here’s why: Many girls are too embarrassed to vocalize their needs, either because a) they don’t want to bruise their man’s ego, b) hell, half of them probably haven’t experimented with themselves enough to know what they like until the guy decides to test it out, and c) you know those grunts and groans and bone-shaking, scream-inducing peaks of passion commonly witnessed in porn, erotica and even romanticized stories from fellow peers? Yeah, they’re usually not accurate. Forget those one-night stands with the fuck-and-flee horndogs; even with regular, well-acquainted lovers, these scenes might still not see the light of day. Nevertheless, girls perceive this to be the norm and, hence, feel scared to admit that they didn’t experience that out-of-this-world sensation. They may feel inadequate; they may think themselves “annoying” and a “sexual hassle” or they may feel “not intense enough.” Regardless, they still aren’t getting that orgasm, and that’s that.</p>\n<p>4. And, frankly, if you just want to cut it down to the blunt and bare: it’s mental, and the girl isn’t feeling it now. By that point, sometimes it’s just too plain fucking awkward for the more soft-spoken, or any-spoken for that matter, to explicitly declare “I put two fingers by the side of my clit and move them like I’m playing a piano trill” or “Can you rub your palm on the top and then curl your middle and ringfingers into a u-shape and sort of press there—no wait, there, ah—I mean, no not like that—wait, ugh, stop.” Right. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are multiple ways to go about this, and I have yet to perfect this deal myself. First, however, foreplay must not be ignored. Watch some steamy videos, engage in long-desired fantasies, talk dirty. Anything that works because, after all, a good portion of sex is mental. Furthermore, angles matter. It is said that two inches is actually enough to take the girl to her heavenly heights due to the fact that most of her nerves are bundled up toward the entrance of the vagina.</p>\n<p>Most often than not, however, the biggest solution to the neglected climax is just forcing yourself to communicate. I hate telling any woman to “man up” because that phrase is atrociously incorrect in more ways than one, but in the figurative sense behind the phrase, yes, toughen up that resolve. Lift up that chin. Life normally won’t hand you gems and jewels in a treasure chest; it just chucks you little poop pellets. Therefore, as is logical, we need to shake off that nervous hesitation and be strong with stating what we want, what we need and what will make us happy.</p>\n<p>So, 70 percent, I challenge you. Maybe that “thirst-quenching, tsunami wave-surging” orgasm won’t come right away, but it’s definitely there, lurking on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>R.

As your dedicated Humptress, it is my duty to divulge this to you. You may now sigh in relief. You are now either more holy than I and abstain or one of my brethren. What a cozy atmosphere we’ve established for ourselves. Porn is very interesting because it varies so greatly between individuals. And it is highly taboo in its nature, of course. More than once I have casually brought it up to my friends and more often than not, they get this peculiar halting look, like, “Oh, wait, you just hit the sharing wall.” NAY. I say we’re going to Kool-Aid Man that wall up in dis bitch! I’m going to rant to you on why porn rocks and why you should chill out and swallow all of these deep-seeded worries you have buried inside of you (hehe).</p>\n<p>I think porn is the most personal thing people have in relation to their sexual life. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they are not really getting any, but are instead indulging their base desires in secret. Heaven forbid people see what you do in secret. It’s so often associated with deviant behavior. Let’s amend that. It’s just another form of kink, especially if you and an adventurous partner want to have your own personal viewing session.<br>\nMany girls seem uncomfortable with porn, which is silly. Maybe this is due to a lack of female advertising on porn websites, among other things. We know that most every guy out there has a substantial porn folder on their computer, hidden under something like, “Dull Trip to Kansas, Totally Not Worth Opening.” I think girls are more worried about what other girls will think, which is also dumb. I personally would rather engage in some scintillating media than have the pristine approval of women everywhere.<br>\nIt’s important to realize that the porn does not easily translate to the real world. Don’t treat your partner like she’s a pornstar. She will not thank you when you decide you want to copy the bukakke video you were watching last night just because the pornstar seemed enthused. It’s a lie. However, ladies, if you indulge in porn from time to time, it can be a valuable asset in your sex life. If you do decide to emulate things you see in porn, it often goes very well. His eyes will bug out, glazed and delighted, as he flashes back to the vigorous fapping he indulged in the night prior. “Hot damn, she knows what she’s doing,” he will think, in much fewer words (signified by “guh-huuuuuhh”).<br>\nIf you are comfortable and you have a regular partner, I think it would be healthy to tell them about your preferences, especially if you think it will open doors to things you want to try together. This does not apply to everyone. The type of porn some people watch is not reflective of what they would actually like to do. There is no freaking way I want to try many of the things I have encountered in my porn viewing. So don’t judge yourself or others based on the weird shit they watch. The more you watch and dabble, the more you find out what you like. Naturally, there are some types of porn that deserve thorough judging, which I feel I don’t need to describe.<br>\nIt’s fun.<br>\nI like to think of porn as literature for sex. If you want to learn how to do the Macarena, you look up a YouTube video. If you want to learn how to twerk while on top, you watch porn. It’s academic, goddammit.<br>\nSometimes you hit a dry spell. Instead of becoming a born-again virgin due to a lack of suitors, hit up those naughty pop-ups.<br>\nAs I’ve said before, I don’t think you should be afraid of sex or your sexuality. So just try it out. I’m not saying abandon real-life sex for your Internet mistress, Betsy Onnerback, but simply familiarize yourself with the different types of sex and sexual interests that are out there. Ultimately, go get ideas, get comfortable, but don’t get a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>As you know, my little chickadees, I like to assign you all homework.

It should be a tease, a light tracing, a “hello” from tongue to tongue, not an all-caps “OH HAY DERE.”</p>\n<p>Between girlfriends, there’s an innocent enjoyment to the kiss. There’s no threat, no tongue siege. It’s just kissing for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>So go on, ladies, get a little tipsy and goofy with your gal pals and exchange a peck or two. No one takes these things seriously; it’s a form of play. Don’t get so in-your-head about these things.</p>\n<p>It is important I specify that I personally don’t condone kissing as a show. If you want to kiss another girl and there happen to be people around, fuck it. But if you’re being that drunk girl who’s doing it with the hopes of making guys stare at you, it will likely work but also make you look immature.</p>\n<p>And don’t be that guy. You all know him: He’s the one who goes up to the two girls like, “Hey, shall I join you ladies?” Dude, you will be ignored. Just admire the beauty of the situation and remain silent. You are a man amidst nature, witnessing two unicorns going at it. Don’t disturb the majesty.</p>\n<p>Now, on top of all of this, there are, of course, social politics that go into making out with members of the same gender. To cite renowned sexologist Alfred Kinsey, one’s sexuality can be viewed as a point on a sexual gradient rather than confined to a certain category of sexuality. I think we can all appreciate and agree with this statement. Kinsey also found that, along this gradient, females are the more fluid of the two genders. They can be closer to the middle, at times. When girls get drunk and make out, it’s not necessarily because they identify as bisexual. I’ve made out with a fair number of my female friends. Often it’s something close friends do when they reach a certain level of shwasted. I wouldn’t make out with my roommate normally. But throw some booze in the situation, and suddenly there are three girls kissing at once.</p>\n<p>What’s fascinating to me is that despite partaking in a little tongue waggling, none of the girls I’ve kissed would identify as bisexual or lesbian. It’s purely for enjoyment. I would describe the atmosphere as one of playful innocence — naughty but fun. Now here is the odd thing to me: If two guys got hammered and started making out, the same social rules often would not apply. I am not saying this is fair. I am not saying this is something people unanimously agree upon. But if two guys were making out at a party, most would instantly assume they were bisexual or homosexual, right? If it was a joke, I could dig it. However, if it was carried out in the same fashion that my female friends and I do our kissing (i.e. enjoying one another and ignoring the populace) then I must admit, I would be turned off by both males. They would not be potential candidates for sending their deep v-diver into my ocean blue. Many girls I speak to agree (with the exception of the female friend whose eyes brightened as she cried out with delight, “Threesome!”).</p>\n<p>Now, things are certainly gearing toward that sort of behavior being more acceptable. I think that’s healthy and exciting. Norms are shifting! Huzzah! But at this point, there is still that frustrating tilt in male versus female social codes. If a girl invites multiple suitors into her boudoir, you assume that eventually it’ll be like throwing a hot dog into a hallway. But if a guy does the same, smoldering at da’ bitches before getting down, no worries, he’s just another playa’. These are the typical standards of our time. But still, in comparison to what our mums and dads faced, this is significant progress. Consider this: 30 years ago, you were a slut if you put out before five dates. I hear people moaning and groaning about having to wait for three.</p>\n<p>So my sweetlings, dabble in some smooching of the sisters and enjoy getting fresh with your lady bros. Experimentation is a healthy, integral part of the college experience. Eventually the realms of experimentation may continue to expand to be more inclusive. Party on, my gaping-gobbed Gauchos, and Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. is immune to the drunchies.

Television and movies had taught me that this type of individual was to be avoided on the basis of also avoiding bullying and homophobia. As a young gay kid in the closet invariably would be, I was terrified that I wouldn’t get along with the prototypical hyper-masculine bro-types that sometimes seem to make this school their mecca. Fast forward two years to my current living situation, and I can say that cohabitating with a group of five of them has taught me a thing or two about how to bring my own special brand of sexual enlightenment to a group of otherwise heteronormatively inclined dudes who may never have given a passing thought to the fluidity of sexuality, the importance of male love in ancient Rome or any other inane ideas I throw at them. This social experiment of sorts I’ve been silently conducting has culminated not only in the formation of a tight-knit and tolerant group, but also a more sexually aware and, dare I say, politically-savvy group of friends who care deeply for one another. I like to think that I’m at least 75 percent responsible for this result but, admittedly, I made that number up.</p>\n<p>What’s that, you ask? What’s the secret to my seeming success in eradicating sexual and social stereotypes? Why, I’m glad you asked, dear reader. My secret — and here’s where it gets really complicated — was that I treated them all like I would treat any other group of friends: like people I want to get to know. Confused?

And in that time, we debated issues of sex, sexuality, gender, politics and culture, you name it. We held parties and watched movies together; we went on hiking trips and to fancy restaurants. I even gave them an informational session on how gay sex works. I got to know these guys, and they got to know me. So I guess that’s the simple secret to our friendship. Shocking isn’t it?</p>\n<p>So over the course of this admittedly boring and rather mundane anecdote, we come to the fairly obvious conclusion that those popular social models and the stereotypes that society presents us with, are too often false. This group of men that I had secretly been afraid of has turned into a set of the best friends I have ever known. My fear surrounding their masculinity and whether that would be a barrier to our friendship was not grounded in reality but rather in a set of preconceived notions handed to me by (for lack of a better word) “society.” So the next time you find yourself considering new friends, whether it’s that frat bro in your section, the sorority girl in your CLAS class or the stoner down the hall, they all have their own story to tell, and I’m sure you might like to hear it.</p>\n<p><em>This message has been approved by the bros of Luc Gendrot.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 8 of the Wednesday, February 27, 2013 print edition of the<em> Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/","id":6367,"author":{"id":456,"name":"Luc Gendrot"},"related":[6366,6365,6364],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"route":"/categories/opinion/wednesday-hump","highestPage":11}},"__N_SSG":true}
