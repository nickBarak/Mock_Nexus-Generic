Randomly, we passed by one of my regulars — another cutie with a taste for fucking outside the box. Collectively, we all decided to go home together, only to meet a horny frat boy claiming that he was “straight,” but had always wanted to try something different. We excitedly made our way to my house, ran past my roommates and locked the door to my room … the rest was history — an experience that changed my views on sex and opened me up, quite literally, to new levels of sexual pleasure.</p>\n<p>Let’s face it: when it comes to sex, variety is the spice of life. Often, being with the same partner — intimately or sexually — can leave one feeling bored and ultimately craving more. Too much vanilla, chocolate or any flavor, for that matter, often fosters a thirst that can only be quenched by a multi-flavored swirl … a rainbow sherbet of sorts. But enough beating around the bush. What I’m talking about today is the dirty, raunchy, fun and taboo art of group sex.</p>\n<p>Many of you may be thinking, “My sex life is great, why try group sex?” or “If I love my partner, why would I want to include a third or even fourth person to my sex life?” My response: group sex isn’t something that people do just out of boredom or sexual frustration; rather it is often a great way to find out more about your partner and yourself. That third girl might find an erogenous zone you didn’t know existed, and that other guy might find a position that better works with your G-spot. In fact, you might even learn new things about your sexuality that you were too afraid to explore in the past. I’m a gay man, but my first sexual experience with a girl happened during a foursome and since then, I’ve learned that there are some aspects of the female body that I actually find attractive and even erotic. As such, today we’re going to talk about group sex, because everyone should at least give it some thought.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sex with multiple partners has a very unique dynamic, one which is entirely unlike one-on-one sex. Intimacy is definitely harder to create, but eroticism is heavily underscored — it’s much harder to be bored when multiple partners are giving you pleasure. Initiating group sex requires lots of communication. If you have a regular or serious partner, you should always let them know that you’re interested in bringing other people into bedroom before the night begins. Sometimes this pre-sex communication is unnecessary, but that is almost always because the three-way or fourgy is completely spontaneous, probably as a result of drunken hookups with various partners.</p>\n<p>The most common questions I get asked regarding group sex are “how many partners are usually involved?” and “who does what?” In the gay world, the possibilities in terms of the number of partners are essentially endless, because men can line up. Usually, though, the guy in front is a sole bottom, those in the middle go versatile and penetrate whilst being penetrated, and the caboose of the sexy soul train tops while keeping the rhythm of the rest of the group going. In straight world, three-ways most commonly involve two girls and one guy — a consequence of sociocultural norms — but can also involve two guys and one girl if the men are only “straight.” With two guys, the threesome often takes a trip to France, a ménage à trois in which the girl is penetrated by one guy and gives oral to the other. The resulting group resembles the Eiffel Tower. Alternatively, it’s possible for the girl to get penetrated both vaginally and anally, although this is often difficult to do, as rhythm between the partners is hard to keep. A solution? Have the guys utilize the same hole … when we’re talking about group sex, DP isn’t just that street you party on, but also a fun position reserved mainly for the sexually experienced. Gays: DP on DP is an option for you too, but don’t forget to use lots of lubricant, as the possibility for condom failure is high when trying this.</p>\n<p>On another note, threesomes made up of two girls and one guy almost always involve penetration of the girls separately, but if the sex is planned, sex toys such as dildos and vibrators are an easy and effective way to make sure that both women are receiving adequate pleasure over the course of the entire experience. In group sex, it is also important to make sure that all partners are completely comfortable at all times … in the heat of it all, it is easy to neglect one person temporarily in the wake of erotic moments with another, so make sure that everyone is happy by reading body language and seeing to it that no individual is shut out or untouched at any time. Even though threesomes seem to be the most common form of group sex, one way to make sure that no one gets neglected is to follow the rule of two: sex in even-numbered groups. By doing this, you ensure that everyone will have a partner throughout the experience and no one is left out or leaves without orgasm.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, group sex is an awesome way to jazz up your sex life, learn new things about your partner and even yourself. Whether it’s planned or it happens spontaneously, I can tell you from personal experience that sex with multiple partners is guaranteed to make for some of the most interesting, enjoyable and altogether amazing sexcapades possible. “The More the Merrier” is a saying that applies to lots of things, and your sex life, above all, should be one of them.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is surprised that his roommates still choose to live with him year after year.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, February 19, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Your partner appreciates your creativity and gets off on a good surprise. Catch them off guard this year with a scavenger hunt that ends at the health clinic with this sort of a poem: “Your handcuffs are red, my KY is blue, let’s get our junk checked out today, because I care about you.” Let’s hope the surprises end there this Valentine’s Day.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i> The Sexperts are watching.

People everywhere suffer from a similar problem: being unable to communicate sexual preferences with their partners. The fact of the matter is, people have to learn at one point or another. This girl you’re with probably has no idea that she’s rubbin’ you raw; she probably thinks she’s doing you a favor. Let her know next time because she’s probably not a mind reader (and if she is, she’s probably just a sadist who likes to watch you squirm). It can be as easy as, “Slow down a little,” or “Try to loosen your grip.” You don’t have to make her feel inadequate, just give her some tips so she learns and gets better. I guarantee you that she could give you a few pointers, too, and once that door is open, better sex awaits. Also, don’t forget the positive reinforcement. When something changes for the better, get excited about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I want to have a threesome with my boyfriend and a friend from back home. I don’t know how to bring this up with my boyfriend, and I’m worried that he’ll take it the wrong way. What should I do?</em></p>\n<p>Threesomes are a lot to handle — that’s a lot of moving parts. This is a sticky topic, no doubt about it because someone always feels left out or jealous, especially when it’s with a serious partner or someone you know well. I would not recommend springing this on him with details, because you might get a “Fuckyousaid?!” if you do. Poke around a little, see how he feels about threesomes in general before you get specific. Then if he seems into it, you can suggest something more concrete, but you have to be prepared for the fact that you still might get a nice, clean “Fuckyousaid?!” Also, you might consider dumping the boyfriend if you’re feeling so sexually attracted to someone else. Either way you decide to go with it, be prepared for things to change in a big way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>From start to finish I’m only getting about 10 minutes in, on average. After seeing all these videos of guys going for like 45 minutes and reading about fucking Sting going for like 36 hours straight, I’m getting the feeling that I’m doing something wrong. Help?</em></p>\n<p>First of all, Sting is a sex machine — literally a mechanical tool, if that is true. I feel so sorry for his partner because the sheer stamina that would take is baffling and somewhat terrifying. Nonetheless, relax! That’s the best piece of advice I can give you. Most studies on the matter show the average and/or optimal duration for intercourse to be contained within the range of three to 13 minutes. Granted, that does not include foreplay, but if you’re actually having sex for 10 minutes, you’re much closer to the optimal time than Sting is … he’s way off. So, take a breather and, if you really are concerned about lasting longer, look into 1) getting in better shape 2) controlling your breathing 3) focusing on your partner instead of yourself. Other than that, take a deep breath and get ready for round two!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This girl told me that she was a virgin, which was fine, but later, when we had sex, she didn’t bleed … was she lying to me?</em></p>\n<p>Don’t worry; she probably wasn’t lying to you. Virginity isn’t about whether or not a girl bleeds when she first has sex, since many girls have “broken” their hymens without ever having sex. Now, I won’t go completely middle school sex-ed class on you, but basically, a girl will bleed during her first time only if her hymen and the tissues around it have never been stretched to the point that they stretch during intercourse. And on a bike-riding, yoga-crazed campus like this one, just think of how many women have already reached that point just from doing their everyday routine. Plus, a lot of the time, that first-time bleeding is actually just because the girl is too nervous, and therefore tense or poorly lubricated. So actually, the fact that she didn’t bleed probably means that she was turned on and comfortable … good on you, mate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’m all for a guy being in touch with his feelings, but I recently had sex with this guy for the first time, and he cried afterwards? I really like him, and the sex was good, but I’m not really sure how to deal with this.</em></p>\n<p>When you orgasm, your body is releasing a shit ton of crazy hormones (all scientific terms) into your body. The high levels of dopamine can make you feel gloriously happy and giggly when you climax, or the euphoria can get a little bit overwhelming, and you might end up a little bit weepy. Don’t worry about why it’s happening; it probably confirms that the sex was great for him too. Just know that it’s very common, but also that he might feel a little bit emasculated after this happens. Help his ego out by being vocal about how much you enjoyed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The guy I’ve been hooking up with is really reluctant to use condoms because he says they make it harder for him to orgasm, so he prefers the pull-out method. I don’t want to get pregnant … will the pull-out method suffice?</em></p>\n<p>What?! <em>Sacre bleu, no!</em> This is where Sam puts hir foot down. Did you learn nothing in sex-ed? First of all, the pull-out method is going to do absolutely nothing to protect you from STDs, so good luck with that. Next, it is definitely still possible for you to get pregnant, even if he doesn’t come inside of you. In fact, literally, the only cool thing about the pull-out method is that you can also call it <em>coitus interruptus</em> … which sounds classy as hell … still not saying you should do it though! So now that you’ve managed to make me sound like your mother, here’s some real advice: If the problem is the condoms, then he should try out some different types; some men prefer polyurethane to latex, or maybe a different shape or size will make a difference. You absolutely have access to condoms here, whether it be at 7-Eleven, or, if they’re sold out of everything but Magnums (it’s happened), at the Student Health center (fo’ free!). And if he keeps insisting on going raw dog, the problem might be him …</p>\n<p><em>Sam the Oracle is all-knowin‘ when it comes to humpin‘.

But in the gay community, apps like Grindr and Jack’d have recently been setting the scene for hookups no matter where you are. Even now, if I open my “dating app” and look at the horny guys nearby probably sitting in their rooms, hands in their pants cradling their hard, thirsty … phones, it’s alarming to think that many of them are less than 1,000 feet away. Gay neighbors on the DL? Possibly. But the fact of the matter is that dating apps are very quickly becoming the norm for people in both the gay and straight communities, with users often looking for more than just casual sex, sometimes even finding relationships with the people they meet.</p>\n<p>When my best friend first showed me Tinder, I immediately equated it to Grindr. For those of you who haven’t heard of Grindr, it’s that phone app you probably see your gay friends on when they’re bored or horny. Its premise is simple: local gay guys have profiles that give you their age, weight, preferences and even distance from you. Whether you talk to other guys on the app looking for a hookup or a date is up to you, but recently, the stigma attached to Grindr is similar to that attached to the gay community as a whole — promiscuous sex. That’s why when my friend showed me Tinder, a similar application that allows users to look through other people’s pictures and either “like” or “dislike” them, I assumed it was based on the same sexual premises as its gay older brother.</p>\n<p>What’s interesting about Tinder is the fact that you aren’t even given the option of talking to another user unless they “like” you back, meaning that there’s an underlying “I like you, you like me” mutual attraction inherent in every interaction. Another thing I noticed about Tinder is that it lacks the headless torsos that pervade the Grindr-verse. To the breeders — gay slang for straights — out there, headless torsos are guys on Grindr whose profiles are just pictures of their shirtless bodies. What usually follows in conversations with these guys are dick pics, followed by more dick pics, with the occasional “I’d pay you ‘x’ amount of money to blow you.” To blow me? Damn, sounds great. But in reality, most of these headless torso guys seem so STD-ridden that touching them with an actual stick is risky, let alone with my own stick. Because something must be wrong with the picture (quite literally) if you can’t even show your face to the person you’re about to bang.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But back to Tinder. What I find most interesting about the app is that a lot of my friends actually go on dates with the guys/girls they meet on it. Now as a guy who’s trying to move past the hookup culture of Isla Vista, I naturally wanted to make my own Tinder to see what it was all about, so one night last week I threw together a profile. First, I added some pictures of me that weren’t so hideous I wouldn’t get matches, but alternately not so hot that people be disappointed seeing me in person. My “about me” was honest and I made it known that I was “down for whatever, but looking for dates.” Then the rating started, where I had the opportunity to like or dislike guys based on their five pictures and short descriptions about who they were. Immediately, I realized that this app was definitely aimed at finding me love, and I laid in bed excited to wake up to the guys who might be “the one.”</p>\n<p>The next morning I woke up to 20-something matches. Stoked, I opened up my Tinder only to find that the majority of the guys I’d matched with were as thirsty as me the morning after a crazy night on DP. I was hoping for something deep; a connection with someone that went farther than wanting to go inside of me. But all I found was the same cheesy “let’s fuck” pick-up lines I was all too familiar with hearing.</p>\n<p>I didn’t respond to most of the guys, but will say that I found a couple that were actually interested in taking me out. What I realized was that there is a silver lining surrounding the negative stigmas associated with dating apps: you’ll get out of them what you put into them. My experiences on Grindr and Tinder in the past have been primarily sexual, but my profiles on both literally say that I am “down for whatever” — granted, probably not the best way to catch a winner in a pond of horny toads. What I’ve come to realize is that by adding a little bit of sexual flair in my profiles to keep my options open, I’ve actually blocked out most opportunities to get guys who wanted something serious.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I believed the stereotype that often defines the gay community — that we’re all a bunch of sex-crazed rabbits looking to get it in whenever possible. And while that may be true for some, in reality, there are plenty of guys and girls out there who really do want to foster serious relationships in college and beyond, many of whom are doing so using apps like Tinder and Grindr every day.</p>\n<p>In closing, I believe that what you get out of dating apps is based on what you put into them. One of my closest gay friends has been in a relationship with his boyfriend for seven months — they’re perfect for each other — and they met on Grindr. One of my roommates though, uses Tinder solely to look for casual sex and I’m trying to find where I fall on this spectrum. So now, I have a date this Thursday with a guy I met on the same app I used to think was just a meeting place for the sexually desperate. In short, whether you’re looking for sex, dates, conversation, a confidence boost or even love, dating apps definitely make good use of the technological age that we’ve all grown up in.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is 753 feet away, horny and “down for whatever.”</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 29, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

However, men seem to harbor no shame about the fact that, yeah, they masturbate. So why do women still tend to feel discouraged to explore their lady parts? Why does it feel so taboo to learn your own body?</p>\n<p>I can say that I subscribed to this dichotomy between the sexes for so long because I was embarrassed and afraid that it was “wrong” to touch myself or to use toys to help get me going (if you know what I mean). It isn’t necessarily the most common thing for women to do, nor does it tend to be discussed in the same way that men so openly talk about it, but undeniably, there is a large number of women who masturbate regularly.</p>\n<p>I was thinking to myself, “If I don’t know what I like, how will I be able to tell future lovers how to properly please me?” Most women have no idea what an orgasm feels like, and I didn’t want to be one of the many who have never received such pleasure. So, of course, like the human that I am, I asked Google what would be the best way to achieve proper climax, because obviously Google has the answers to everything, ever. This was when I learned that, although a man can help, you must first learn how to be comfortable with your own body, which entails self-exploration. One way that they suggest you can start exploring is by considering the idea of investing in sex toys. Yes girls, I said it — sex toys.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Going off of Google’s recommendation, I began researching different kinds of sex toys. And if you didn’t know — because I had no idea — there is an extremely wide variety of vibrators and I came (*wink wink*) upon a world of possibility, a world that I never knew existed. It was like my own personal <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> experience and boy, was I excited!</p>\n<p>There were beginner vibrators, which were very traditional, simply vibrating as you place them onto your clitoris, until at last they reach an intensity to make you climax like you’ve never felt before. Or there are more advanced sex toys, like the Luna Beads which are a pair of ball-shaped objects that you insert and then go about your daily business. For those of you who have read<em> 50 Shades of Grey</em>, I’m sure you know full well what these lovely beads are. They create this lovely tugging sensation that seems to pull from a dark place of pleasure, without even having to use it on your clitoris or do any work yourself. It’s as though your libido is on fire with burning pleasure and completely relaxed at the same time. All you need to do is a little bit of walking, and there is nothing wrong with a little bit of walking, I mean a little exercise never hurt anybody. If you’re having a bad day, what better way to brighten it than to use your new Luna Beads and clean the house? I can tell you now that cleaning will never be the same again.</p>\n<p>After experimenting with these two toys is when I first discovered that orgasms truly were as great as those screaming girls in porn make it seem and that I never wanted to experience another sexual encounter without an orgasm again. So yes, women have as much of a right to orgasm as men do! And if you ever have to question whether or not you’ve orgasmed, there’s a good chance that you haven’t because you will know when it happens. That’s when you will realize the magic you have been missing out on.</p>\n<p>This first experience is especially important in college because some men are still learning what they’re doing, and the best thing you can do for yourself and your partner is to teach him or her what you like. And the only way to teach is to know what you like, right?</p>\n<p>Change your sex life. Use toys! Explore yourself and reach climaxes like you’ve never felt. It can’t hurt to find your sexual preferences and realize how much more fun you could have been having all along. If nothing else, you can feel like you’ve done women everywhere a service in teaching someone else the proper way to please a woman. That’s the worst that can happen. At best, you get your mind blown several times over. Sex is great, but so much better when you know what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>I don’t recommend advertising your love for sex toys to everyone you meet — it may scare some people away and then you’ll be stuck with your toys for the night. As fun as they are, they’re no substitute for the real thing. They’re pretty lonely. But you’ll know when and where to bring it up. Find a consistent buddy who can help you climax with or without your toys because, although masturbation is a beautiful thing, sometimes it’s fun and sexy when you’re using your pleasure toys with another person.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story, ladies? Invest. Learn yourself, learn what you like. What can you lose from a little one-on-one time? I can say now: Best Investment Ever.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer knows what she’s doing tonight.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 22, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

First and foremost, go back and apologize for leaving because she was paying you a compliment. Female ejaculation usually occurs as a result of repetitive stimulation of the “G-spot” and accompanies an orgasm that is more intense than the ordinary. The liquid that you saw, once again, was not urine. The surprising part, however, is that this liquid is secreted by all women during orgasm. Most of the time it is absorbed directly into the bladder, but for some the contractions force the liquid out causing a visible female ejaculation or “squirting.” Next time you see this happen, be grateful because you know you’re doing something right. Or maybe she thought you were into the “golden shower,” in which case … it probably was pee.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>This girl I’ve been seeing screams her brains out every time we have sex. I’m scared someone is going to think I’m hurting her and call the cops. Is there a way to bring this up or help her be less vocal?</em></p>\n<p>As everyone who lived in the dorms knows, vocal sex is not at all uncommon. Some scientists believe that moaning, or screaming, is a biological response in primate species that evolved to attract more males to mate, thereby increasing the female’s chance of fertilization. Other studies have shown that women moan as a way to express their pleasure (or pain in other situations), or even just to make their partner feel more confident. Feel free to ask what the situation is for her, it may well be uncontrollable in which case you should take that moaning as a big compliment and stop worrying about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Every time I’ve tried shower sex it ends badly. I don’t know if it’s that I can’t find the right position or if it’s just not possible with my body. Is there a trick to it?</em></p>\n<p>Shower sex can be difficult, especially because the showers in Isla Vista are hardly big enough for one person, let alone two people trying to get weird. The fact is, it is going to be more awkward than the usual bed situation: There’s water flying in your faces, you’re bumping into one another and if you fall, you could both die. Just don’t fall and try some of these suggestions:</p>\n<p>Receiver backs into the wall and wraps leg around the giver’s hips while giver holds receiver’s leg and uses the other hand freely.</p>\n<p>Giver lies on the ground with knees bent, receiver straddles and grinds into giver.</p>\n<p>Receiver leans forward and rests hands on the wall, giver enters from behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Why are guys so weird about kissing me after I give them head? I mean, I don’t really care after they go down on me, so what’s the deal?</em></p>\n<p>The Oracle hears about this happening all the time, and it has got to stop. Guys, that’s your body that she’s been pleasuring; she’s doing you a favor. Now do her a solid, and get over your weird fear of accidentally tasting your own semen. That’s not going to happen, and if it does, well … now you know how she feels. If you deny her a kiss after she’s worked so hard for you, she’s going to feel dirty and unwanted … and she might stop coming back. Also, while the Oracle’s at it … can we stop with the whole “pushing the girl’s head down” thing? There’s a lot a girl has to think about while she’s down there (suppressing gag reflex, keeping rhythm, stimulating testicles, remembering to breathe), and that’s not really helping.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>My girlfriend is always going to the bathroom right after we hook up … what’s she doing in there? I have this crippling fear that she’s texting all of her friends about how bad the sex was …</em></p>\n<p>Dude, first of all, chill out. Second of all … you’re going to be sorry that you ever asked. I’ll let you in on some knowledge that is commonly known to women and completely baffling to men: Girls have a lot of stuff going on down there. I know, crazy scientific, but basically, whenever you have sex, there are a lot of foreign bacteria getting in places where it just shouldn’t be. Doctors recommend that girls urinate after sex just to flush all of those bacteria out of the area, therefore helping to prevent the contraction of urinary tract infections. And trust the Oracle: if your girl has one of those, the last thing she’s going to want to do is hook up with you. Also, maybe you’ve never taken the time to ponder this, but what goes in must come out, and therefore, if you didn’t use a condom, she might be dealing with some strange dripping (another argument for condoms). Basically, it’s very unlikely that she’s in there talking about you; she’s just keeping up her hygiene, and she should be commended for it. Now you guys can have a nice, long cuddle (the Oracle insists) without her having to worry about what’s going on down there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The guy I’ve been hooking up with always wants use the same, standard position with him on top. I’m getting kind of bored down here; how can I get him to change it up?</em></p>\n<p>If you want to get what you deserve, you’ve got to start using your words. If you’re scared of hurting his feelings, don’t be; your partner isn’t going to be able to read your mind, and sometimes, in the heat of the moment, they might get greedy and forget that you have needs too. It happens to everyone, but it can easily be fixed with good old-fashioned communication. The best way that you can get your partner to try something new without killing the mood is to make it all about your partner: “I wanna be on top of you,” “I think this will feel better for you,” etc. Or, try just embracing your inner dominatrix and command of your partner what you want him to do; sometimes, the more obvious, the better. Pre-planning can also be helpful; if you’re still in the early throes of foreplay, throw them up against a wall or a chair so that your starting point isn’t the boring old bed. Hey, if you’re looking for a place to start, might I suggest you look directly to your left and check out our Position of the Week?</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>I have a ton of sexy lingerie that I bought for an ex, and I kind of want to try it out on a new manfriend. But I’m nervous … is it going to freak him out?</em></p>\n<p>The Oracle cannot tell a lie; I’ve heard about times when the lingerie has indeed freaked a partner out. Those men must be fools, but Oracle also sees how this could make for an awkward situation. If you and your partner are not very serious, they might take this move as a sign that you’re trying to take the relationship to a new level. Although, anyone out there who subscribes to this thought process should drop this idea right now; any time that your partner tries to introduce something new into the bedroom (also applies to new positions or props), they’re just trying to spice things up. Be open to new things, but if there’s something that you’re deeply uncomfortable with, you can always respectfully decline. In terms of the lingerie issue, I’d say go for it. But don’t just rip your clothes off and take your partner by surprise; it’s much more fun to give yourself a little buildup. Tell them you have something special planned, or you have a surprise. If they don’t react well, or if you get cold feet at the last minute, you can always excuse yourself for a quick bathroom change. But above all, the Oracle thinks you should do whatever you decide to do with confidence. You got this.</p>\n<p><em>Sam the Oracle is all-knowin‘ when it comes to humpin‘.

Get Fit.</p>\n<p>Being in good shape (which does not necessarily entail having a flat stomach or enormous biceps) will benefit you in more ways than you can imagine when it comes to sex.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being in shape is proven to correlate strongly with having confidence, which subsequently helps to reduce anxiety when it’s time for the clothes to come off.</li>\n<li>A background in fitness helps build breath control, a crucial aspect of both enjoying a long-lasting bedroom session … and sounding sexy during it.</li>\n<li>Working out helps build muscle, encourage flexibility and increase aerobic endurance … Let me count the ways in which these will benefit your sex life: You can enjoy longer-lasting and more powerful erections, less leg cramps, less panting, more control over your body, the ability to move yourself around to find that perfect spot and a greater freedom to try new positions that might require you supporting yourself or your partner. Basically, get fit so you can get wild.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. Be Charitable.</p>\n<p>According to a study conducted in the U.K., exhibiting noble behavior makes both sexes appear more sexually attractive. Therefore, not only will doing charity work make everybody else happier, but it will eventually make you quite a bit happier, too. Although there are different forms of charity, most of which we highly encourage, we are going to teach you the spirit of charity in the bedroom in the hopes that it will translate seamlessly into your public lives as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go down on your partner just because. It doesn’t always have to be a special occasion. This can really spice your night, morning, lunch break, etc. up. (This is even doable on a first date, given the proper circumstances, especially in Isla Vista).</li>\n<li>Try something you know your partner is into, even if you think it might be a little strange. He likes leather — wear some! She likes football — put some pads on! The options are endless.</li>\n<li>A bit of subtlety, for a change, is always a nice surprise: a massage with candles can do wonders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Get Organized.</p>\n<p>This is the perfect time to reevaluate all of your relationships: If you’ve been dating for a while, make sure things aren’t going stale. It’s the beginning of the quarter, so take this time to figure out a good schedule that allows the two of you to get that quality time in before you get too busy with school and work. Try to find at least one night that will work as date night for this quarter, and commit to that.</p>\n<p>We also know that a Gaucho’s preferred relationship status is something along the lines of, “We’re just having fun,” and that half the fun of having a hookup buddy is the spontaneity of those late-night booty calls, so don’t try to stifle those with organizational thoughts. But if you’re not getting your needs satisfied, yet you keep going back to that one person based on sheer convenience, it’s time to try something new. Remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea … hot, buff, generous, knowledgeable fish… And if you’re in a position where you could possibly be bringing someone home in the near future, get organized first.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your room clean; it’s hard to get steamy in the sack when said sack is full of Doritos crumbs … ew.</li>\n<li>Take an inventory of your Socks&amp;Sex drawer and restock: candles, condoms, oils, toys and props … basically, if you’ve ever been mid-hookup and thought to yourself, “Damn, I wish I had a [blank] right now,” use that Amazon gift card you got as a holiday present to treat yo’self to some <i>personal</i> shopping … thanks, Aunt Karen!</li>\n<li>It may be a new year, and a new you, but don’t think everything that happened in 2013 is now magically erased…if you don’t see where we’re going with this, we’re suggesting it’s a good time to get tested, for you and your partner’s sake (see, you’re being more generous already!) Between the resources offered at Student Health and those at the Planned Parenthood downtown, it’s the one resolution that you have no excuse for not keeping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. Learn a New Instrument.</p>\n<p>Acquiring a new skill can do wonders for you, especially in the bedroom. Once again, we’re not going to preach that you go out and buy a guitar so that you can serenade your partner; we can’t all be Brett Dennen. But each and every person who is interested in having and/or maintaining a sexual relationship has talents that they can learn or further develop in the bedroom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become an expert on the physiology of sex. Buy a book on anatomy, watch some videos online or ask your partner for a tour. No matter which way you do it, do your best to learn how to better reach something, or tickle something else and make yourself and your future partners happy.</li>\n<li>Find something you think the sexual world is lacking and become a master at it (sometimes trial and error is the only way). For example, learn how to do a great strip tease, give excellent oral sex, last for hours on end, talk just the right amount of dirty or kiss better than anyone ever knew was possible.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A few months ago, I got the Snapchat app. I was looking forward to being included in all my sorority sisters’ standard pictures of duck faces and froyo. But while I am constantly bombarded with those, I also started to receive something unexpected: A full on Snapchat terrorist attack. Getting a friend request from a random username (and here’s where mistakes were made), I figured I would simply add them; surely the snaps would lend to their identity, right? False. It instead led to two months of me receiving bizarre dick pics. The penis was always flaccid and noodly and, perhaps to lessen the blow, it was always framed in hearts, flowers and smiley faces. Due to my inexperience with the app, I was drastically unprepared: I had no idea how to delete people. And I kept forgetting his username, so I was always freshly bombarded when I opened the snaps. Finally, some kind soul showed me how to delete the heinous doodling flasher.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m all for a good naughty picture … given the right circumstances. So maybe I should outline what those circumstances are, for all of you prospective pic-senders:</p>\n<p>Rule #1: Pictures and sexts should always be consensual. An unwanted dick pic can ruin your day. My friend says she really appreciates it when a guy preludes a picture with, “Hey, can I send you a dirty picture?” rather than just doing it. That way you don’t embarrass yourself, and your recipient won’t be afraid to open messages from you.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rule #2: Save them for someone special. Personally, I wouldn’t trust a lot of guys with a naked picture of me. There’s no doubt in my mind that they’d want to show their buddies or do something douchey, like make it a contact picture. Heaven forbid they hold it over you if things go badly. I save my pictures for boyfriends or people I really trust. If you do decide to send one to your booty call, for the love of God, please leave out your face.</p>\n<p>Rule #3: Better to Snap it than to text it. Despite my own demons regarding Snapchat, it’s a much better medium for dirty pictures. There’s more security with the time limit (don’t forget about screenshots, though) and you can use the text bar and doodles to make it more fun. For instance, I know someone who takes snaps of his naked body in a mirror, but covers his penis with a heart. It still oils up my love machine, but in a funny, unthreatening way. Just like sex, I think that dick pics are better when they are lighthearted and fun.</p>\n<p>On a similar note, let’s address sexting. Just like naked photos, you need to assess your partner’s willingness to stimulate you with written word. Lead into it, showing them how attractive you find them and how hot and bothered you’re getting thinking about them. “Last night was great … Can’t stop thinking about all the sounds you made ;)” or “Can’t stop thinking about all the things I want to do to you.” Depending on their response — “Oh yeah saucy boy? Like what?”/ “By those sounds do you mean me groaning in disappointment?”) —  you’ll have an idea of whether or not they’re down.</p>\n<p>As aptly stated by a friend of mine, “sexting in locations where sex would be most inappropriate makes for the hottest sextual intercourse.” I can’t help but agree. Sexts are best when one party is in a professional environment or at a family function. Nudge danger with your inappropriately timed boner; it’ll add to the sexual thrill.</p>\n<p>After a buildup, you can go into full blown story mode, i.e., “And then once I pull your panties off with my teeth, I’ll…” That’s always a ton of fun. However, in my opinion, more enticing statements would be, “Thinking about your hot breath on my lap,” or, “Can’t stop thinking about my head pressed between your thighs as you squirm.” Just writing these gets me biting my lip. Tease me, get me all revved up, but don’t give me the satisfaction. That way I’ll be spun up when I finally do see you. Sex is better when you tease beforehand ­­— the same goes for sexting.</p>\n<p>Just like dick pics, sexts are better with creativity. For instance, here is a sexual haiku I received over text message:</p>\n<p><em>Erotic power.</em></p>\n<p><em>Balls slapping against pussy.</em></p>\n<p><em>Your moans drive my lust.</em></p>\n<p>I had the most sophisticated lady boner ever.  That 5-7-5 structure just does it for me.</p>\n<p>Finally, dear readers, I leave you with a challenge: If you have a naughty dick picture you’re considering sending, maybe you’ll take a trip over to <i>http://critiquemydickpic.tumblr.com</i> and culture it up. It’s an amusing website where the web hostess receives your dick pics and gives you an A-F rating, as well as a detailed evaluation. I challenge you to send in your dick pic. Let’s class it up. No more stereotypical ab/dick selfies with yellow lighting; let’s throw in some filters. Make that shit artsy. CONTRAST, YO.</p>\n<p>Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. appreciates when people go the extra mile to make their dick pics classy.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Everyone knows how taboo the subject is, and while it’s actually kind of funny to think that talking about one form of sex is more socially acceptable than talking about another, anal really takes more shit from society than it deserves. Here’s my beef: Last weekend at some party, my friends were having a raunchy conversation about their best lays in Isla Vista. These were my straight friends mind you, and as they went on and on about things like crazy sex in the library or getting head for an hour straight, I decided that I wanted to share too. Now my sex is gay sex and once I brought up the real missionary position, everyone’s voices went silent while their disapproving eyes screamed, “TMI!” Left standing there in the awkwardness I thought, “No guys, you don’t know what you’re missing.” But that’s when it hit me harder than the boy in my story: They didn’t know what they were missing because they literally couldn’t relate to me at all. Today, we talk anal because I realized last weekend that it’s nothing to be anal about in the first place, and everyone needs to realize that.</p>\n<p>Whether you like it or not, the skin lining your anus has a ridiculously high concentration of nerve endings, so nobody — boys or girls, gays or straights — should be afraid of exploring back there to get some extra OOMPF in their sex lives. Guys, ever heard of your prostate gland? Well it’s essentially the closest thing we have to a g-spot and it’s located right along the anal wall about three inches up the rectum. You might think you’ve all experienced orgasms but imagine getting it without the penile stimulation! This might sound strange but it’s just one reality of anal play that most straight couples never get to experience. In fact, studies show that while 90 percent of gay couples have tried anal sex, only 10 percent of straight couples have done the same, meaning that the majority of people are missing out on an experience that is literally orgasmic.</p>\n<p>And while many people are afraid to pay a visit to the oh-so-dirty south, I’m here to let you know that that’s totally all right. I get it. I know how you feel, but as a gay man, my v-card was going to be swiped up the rear by default and you know what I’ve learned from the whole experience? Once you go crack, you never go back. But how do you go about trying it in the first place?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The number of people I know who want to try anal but just don’t know to go about doing it is crazy. It seems like every day, someone is asking me how to do the dirty — literally — and for those I’ve enlightened, rewards literally came. The information I’m about to share with you is historically proven to make you way more than a person’s one-night-stand and has been tried, tested and perfected quite a bit over the years. So take a deep breath, throw your preconceived notions about anal out the window and prepare yourself, because I’m going to be your guide through the back door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>\n<p>By nature anal play requires a little prep — no one wants to find chocolate M&amp;Ms in the bedroom, and some anal play requires cleanliness for the sake of safety. No more than four hours before sex, use the restroom and make sure you are wiped, clean and ready to go down there. If you’re extra anal, wash out the inside of your rectum at the end of a hot shower when your anal sphincters are relaxed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p>\n<p>You have two anal sphincter muscles that control the opening of your anus. You can voluntarily control the outer sphincter, but the inner sphincter is controlled by the involuntary nervous system and clenches in response to stress.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Communication:</strong></p>\n<p>Because anal touching, licking, kissing or fucking might be a new experience for your partner, keep good lines of communication open and make sure he/she is comfortable with what you are about to do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Foreplay:</strong></p>\n<p>If you really want to spice up the moments leading up to sex, try anal foreplay! A rim job involves spreading your partner’s butt cheeks apart and licking the rim of the anus … it might sound weird, but rim jobs create some of the most powerful sensations that the body can experience. If you’re a little turned off by A2M (ass-to-mouth), try stroking the area lightly with your fingers instead. With a male partner, you’ll win extra points if you tickle the fold of skin along his perineum, occasionally moving towards his sack … once you notice him squirming in pleasure, you know you’re doing it right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Lubricant and Condoms:</strong></p>\n<p>If you feel ready to go to the next level with your anal play, make sure you have lubricant and condoms. While any water-based lubricant will do, I suggest Astroglide for its the long-lasting and slick consistency. As for condoms, avoid flavored or “sensation-inducing” types. Your rectum is lined with very sensitive skin, and it’s best to stick with basic latex rubbers to ensure both safety and comfort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Insertion:</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure that the receiving partner’s anus is well-lubricated and that he/she feels relaxed … again, one of your sphincters is controlled by the stress response, so in a sense, you have to want to receive for this to work (girls who’ve experienced accidental dick-slips get why). To begin, slowly stick one lubricated finger into the anus, gliding it in and out to simulate gentle sex. When your partner feels comfortable with this, add more fingers until he/she is prepared for the “D.” Once in, have fun! Anal ejaculation is completely safe and don’t be afraid to experiment with your own positions to keep things exciting!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultimately, anal sex really is one of the most thrilling ways to pleasure your partner. Boy or girl, gay or straight, if you’re sick of the ol’ missionary, over the reverse cowgirl or done with doggy style, run to CVS, grab your favorite lube, throw on a rubber and spice up your sex life! There’s an unexpected item in the bagging area, but guess what, you like it.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is currently on his way to the nearest CVS.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I’m going to expand your fucking horizons in every sense of the phrase. Recently, while exploring the glory that is r/sex (a “subreddit” for coital delights), I came upon something noteworthy: MojoUpgrade.com. This website is designed for couples (or comfortable fuck buddies) that allows you to explore all the little kinks that you are both interested in trying. You can imagine my enthusiasm, being the Lusty Lewis of sexual exploration that I am. As your dedicated Humptress, I surveyed the new territory and I have much to share, sweet Gauchos. This one’s for the couples.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at MojoUpgrade, an interactive sex questionnaire for mates, I was asked whether I wanted to fill out the survey on one computer or two. I recommend doing it on two, especially after prompting my housemate and his lady-love to succumb to my experimentation. To my glee, they filled out the questionnaire in our living room. They kept peeking at each other’s answers as they filled it out and it led to much questioning of the partner and their tastes. “You want to do what to my WHAT?” was not an uncommon exclamation. If you do it on two computers, you can go through the entire questionnaire honestly and thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>As you work your way through the questionnaire, you’ll find it addresses an extensive collection of sexual proclivities. Example: I had to ponder how one might use their lover as ‘sex furniture’ (answer: as a foot stool), or what ‘felching’ is (answer: unspeakable). Intimidated? Don’t be. They also cover more basic sexual interests like hair pulling, biting, spanking, wearing heels during sex or use of toys. If you are strictly opposed to the more advanced options like domination or role-play, there is the option of excluding that set of questions in the survey. I especially enjoyed the advanced options because I always love having something new to try.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In reply to the various interests, some of the responses you can chose from are Yes/No/We Already Do that/If My Partner Is Interested. The beauty of this love machine is that if either party marks ‘No’ for any interest, the sexual niche is thrown out of the results page. That way, there is no feeling of rejection when your enthusiasm for pegging is matched with a firm no.</p>\n<p>Another guinea pig in my experiment made an interesting observation regarding the Yes/No system. If she wanted to see all the stuff he was into trying, couldn’t she just put ‘yes’ for everything? The answer to that is yes — technically. MojoUpgrade is an opportunity to open up a frank conversation between you and your partner about your interests. More than likely they will be confiding passions to you that they may be insecure about. To mark ‘yes’ to everything would be a breach of trust and defeat the purpose of the exercise.</p>\n<p>Once it’s all done, it matches the results up, showing the responses to anything not marked ‘no.’ It’s weirdly sweet seeing what your partner might be willing to concede ‘if you’re interested.’ I won’t tell you what my sexual man-friend conceded to me but it was NOT what I was expecting and I may have laughed in a most sinister and plotting manner. I’m no stranger to the phrase “I have a boner and I am a little afraid.” On top of viewing your aligning interests, each section has links to purchase items to assist in your exploration. For example, if you said you’d be interested in buying a riding crop, it would give you a link to buy aforementioned riding crop.</p>\n<p>All in all, this was a hugely rewarding experience for me and my partner. Once we had all of our results, we were both thrilled to discuss the various interests we’d marked, the rules and reservations we held regarding them and why we found particular things erotic. Your shared disclosure generates a lot of intimacy and sex will be more rewarding for the both of you, in that you can cater to their interests better.</p>\n<p>So my little ducklings, remember: Whether or not you’re a couple, be sure to tell your partner what gets your loins a-frothing. Sex should be a freeing expression and a chance to learn new things about yourself. If you feel like you’re holding yourself back, you’re doing it wrong. Besos, and Happy Humping.</p>\n<p><em>Halyey E. is fondly referred to as “Big Momma” and “Yes Ma’am” by her lovers.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

This is the one time of the year where you can literally wear your fetish on your face and be applauded for it.

Keep your hands to yourself until specifically instructed to do otherwise. As it says on all the posters around campus, there is no justification for sexual assault. Being drunk or high won’t get you out of a speeding ticket, so why would it get you out of rape?</p>\n<p><em>Emile Nelson is terrified of gigantic babies.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I know we all wince when we read that, but with the hardcore ragefest that will soon be occurring in the name of Halloween, it’s especially important to be cautious and aware. And we should note that just because Halloween is the allotted time of the year where girls can dress “slutty” without judgment from other girls, it does not mean that they are slutty. It’s a costume. And anyways, if you’re slut-shaming girls in the first place, you need to check yourself.</p>\n<p>Ladies, many of you take liberties with your drinking and partying because you assume that rape is a rarity. Allow me to startle you into awareness. Recently, I was sitting at Gio’s, drinking a pitcher with a few of my friends, when the topic of rape came up. It was then that I learned all three of the girls I was sitting with had been raped. I was appalled, to say the least. And this was not, “Oh, we hooked up and I was a little tipsy,” rape. All three of them had blacked out at a party or were amongst friends, and things had taken a turn for the worse, sometimes at the hands of aforementioned “friends.”</p>\n<p>Now, if a man rapes, he is at fault. Horrible, horrible things should happen to him and his genitals (I’ll get back to you in a minute, guys). But ladies, it’s up to you to be aware of yourself and your surroundings. Don’t be that girl who blacks out regularly or hooks up when she’s too drunk. Take care of yourself and don’t put yourself in dangerous circumstances if you can help it. Or, if you just feel a little off or uncomfortable, don’t take risks and walk home with strange men.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dudes, obviously consent is sexy. Everyone can agree on that. But I acknowledge that sometimes it is difficult to properly assess whether or not consent is given. Especially if you and your potential partner have had a few drinks; the lines blur. Therefore, I have included the guidelines below for you to use so that you are always certain of yourself and your actions:</p>\n<p>1. Check in with her. Asking a girl straight-out if she wants to have sex is perhaps a little awkward. What I feel works really well is implementing friendly check-ins. “Are you comfortable with that?” is probably the best, followed by, “Does this feel all right?” or, “Do you want me to stop?” The latter should be used especially if you can sense her discomfort. If she is uncomfortable and you can tell, please remember the joys of cuddling. If anyone is uncomfortable, there should be NO nookie. And let me be sure to emphasize, there is a difference between being anxious and excited vs. being uncomfortable. More often that not, your check-ins will be unnecessary but they’ll be touched by your consideration and you won’t get your ass sued.</p>\n<p>2. The minute a girl says “no,” fucking STOP and don’t be an asshole. I’ve explicitly said to guys at parties, “I’ll come home with you, but no sex. If that’s not cool with you, keep looking,” to which they reply, “Oh no, of course.” Upon arriving at their house, they seem to forget my previous rule-setting. God, that’s so annoying. If a girl says no, don’t try to convince her otherwise. Don’t present her with all of the pros of dabbling in your dick and don’t sulk. Seriously, can you see yourself when you sulk and how incredibly unattractive it is? You’re being a petulant ass; appreciate that your partner has boundaries and cuddle up.</p>\n<p>3. If she is too drunk, don’t do it. On top of the whole, “Hey, I’m taking advantage of another human being,” thing, is it really worth it? I mean, she could pee in your bed or throw up. Is it really so hard to find a sober and willing hook up? If this is the kind of behavior you’re going to resort to, you need to assess your quality of character.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to write this because I really don’t see why I have to say these things. It should all go without saying. However, one thing I do want to convey to you is that you have options for when something like this does happen. Ladies, the thing my friends all agreed upon was that they wish they had reported the crime. Some didn’t do it because they had mutual friends with their rapist. Others didn’t because they felt ashamed. Please know that you have easily accessible options and even if you don’t want to report it immediately, you should still take the proper steps.</p>\n<p>If you go to the Rape Crisis Center downtown, you can file a report and have the tests done within 3-5 days of the incident. Afterwards, they will send the file to the police department. Here is the beauty of it: You don’t have to follow through on the case until you want to. You have a whole year where your incident will be on file before they throw it out. If you decide within that time that you want to press charges, you can do so. So even if it happens and you don’t feel like you’re ever going to report it, go anyways. There is no harm in doing so and they’ll be able to offer you the proper counseling services. Also, remember that by reporting a rape, you may be preventing another one.</p>\n<p>So, beloved peers, please be safe and in control of yourself this Halloween. Remember to respect your fellow human beings and know that no one has the right to take advantage of you. Happy Consensual Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. will do horrible, horrible things to your genitals if you take advantage of anyone this Halloween.<br>\n</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

According to our oh-so-omnipresent source of Wikipedia, it represents a form of foreplay that involves two or more people who act out roles in a sexual fantasy. While that explanation more or less adequately portrays the technicality of the act, let’s thrust deeper. My definition of sexual role-play? It’s freedom. Pure, steaming and explosive freedom.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, non role-players question the allure of the act. Why pretend to be someone else when you have a perfectly capable self to be? Why not leave the dress-up and acting for Halloween? This, my friends, is where the freedom comes in. Sexual role-play builds for an almost excruciatingly erotic scene that allows you to overcome many of your sexual inhibitions, at any time and at any place. It grants you permission to access your deepest desires, your innermost fantasies and your most desperate wishes. Want to be tied up and dominated? Have your partner rip your clothes, strip you, bind you, whip you, whisper dirty diction as you grow more and more aroused — any or all of the above to quench that temporary bondage binge. Want to reenact the classic scandal between teacher and pupil? Find a spare room, set up a desk and whiteboard, decide on who teaches and who learns; dress the part and start off like it’s a one-on-one detention session or a last-minute lesson on linear algebra. Then there’s the prisoner and prison guard, the Sleeping Beauty, the dutiful robot, the repairman and the naughty wife, the photographer and the model, the celebrity and a lucky fan … Possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>On top of that, role-play possesses no confinement to physical, in-person play. It can occur via phone, email or an online chat room. It also holds no prejudice against two partners or five as well as a private setting or an open show for suspecting — and unsuspecting — audiences. This is your sexual fantasy put to life, so live it like you want to, folks.</p>\n<p>For the expert role-players, I tip my hat to you and cheer you on. But for the newer actors and actresses just starting out or are contemplating dipping their feet in the fun, here are some tips:</p>\n<p>1. Immerse yourself. Absorbing the essence of your character and your scenario will provide for a more realistic scene. As for generic, easier stories, you can get by from watching some films or using your imagination to hurl out that cowboy drawl or pretend you know anything about teaching. But for some of you ambitious role-playa-playas, be sure to do your research. My boyfriend and I once played out a hypnotist scene, and while it was still hot and heated, I realized midway that I wasn’t fully sure of routines or phrases hypnotists use on their clients, and role-play verbiage became a bit stilted. Of course, it’s important to note that everything depends on your seriousness for the play and your demands on realism. If you’re just messing around and having fun, laughing between scenes and guffawing about the awkwardness is a-okay. But if you want that penetrating experience, get down to business and get into it.</p>\n<p>2. Obtain appropriate props, set a good scene. Again, this depends on how serious you are about the role-play. Some people rent or buy equipment, secure a desired location setting and obtain the appropriate costumes; others work with what they have and simply use a single item to sustain their scene. It doesn’t matter, because you don’t need to go all out in order to feel the sexual steam of role-play. However, props certainly do help accentuate the reality of the scenario and the roles, and visual affirmation acts as a stimulant not only for your eyes but also for your libido.</p>\n<p>3. Just have fun. Ultimately, this isn’t about practicing for an acting audition or memorizing a study guide. We’re just here to unlock our fantasies, and hell, if we’re going to give them life, then we might as well live them up.</p>\n<p>In the end, let’s just say the doctor from the aforementioned scene quenched his desire for release, and the patient calmed her “itch.” And what was left at the end? Two nude college students, laughing on their dorm bed about an amazing night’s play.</p>\n<p>Role-play on, Humpers, and role-play hard.</p>\n<p><em>R.

But after my first time, I realized that sex was great. It was the key to my maturity — it was liberating! And not just intercourse itself; all aspects of human sexuality fascinated me, from courtship to first kisses to all that sexy, dirty nastiness that follows. I mean, if Helen of Troy could bring down an entire empire because some guy wanted to bang her, the sex must have been worth it.</p>\n<p>I mean, if you think about it, what is every living being’s ultimate goal? Survival. And what is survival if you cannot pass on your quality traits to the next generation? Whether you like it or not, you have been hardwired to reproduce, and therefore 99% of us humans are sexually charged (excluding the Shakers and those who identify as asexual, of course).</p>\n<p>Whether you’re waiting for marriage or have already lost count of your I.V. flings, you have to understand that we all have urges. Think about your relationship with food: When you’re hungry, you eat. And when you deny yourself food, that urge to eat doesn’t just go away — it actually worsens over time. Horniness is strikingly similar to hunger. It is a completely natural human drive, one that has kept our species alive for thousands and thousands of years. If we hadn’t explored this primal instinct from the very beginning, our kind would have wasted away, starving for the nourishment we could only give to each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Obviously we don’t need to repopulate the Earth anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean these urges have faded away. Plain and simple, sex feels good, and so does eating. The brain releases pleasure signals when you feed and when you fornicate — think of the evolutionary “Four Fs”: fighting, fleeing, feeding and fucking, all controlled by our friend, the hypothalamus. So why deny yourself of two of the greatest feelings in the world?</p>\n<p>Of course, there is always the problem of overindulgence. What happens when you overeat? You develop a wide variety of problems, your ass included. We all know obesity is one of the most pressing health issues in America, along with Type II Diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Sex can have a hefty price tag as well. Unplanned pregnancy, STIs and the emotional trauma that can arise from risky behavior are just some of the reasons why so many preach abstinence.</p>\n<p>But my tried-and-true motto? Everything in moderation. Find a balance. If you can physically and emotionally handle a hookup every night of the week, go for it! If you want to slow things down with a committed relationship, that’s cool too! Fine with taking things in your own hands for a while? Dandy! I, myself, at 4’9” and a hundred pounds, cannot eat five heavy meals a day, but I still have my favorite, go-to recipes. And of course, a light snack every once in a while certainly curbs the urge.</p>\n<p><em>Echo Meyers is a first-year pre-biology major.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Recently, I’ve been hearing more and more about “labiaplasty,” which is essentially plastic surgery on the vagina. If you’re feeling horrified right about now, we’re probably on the same page here. Now, I understand the importance of surgeries like this for people who are for example, intersex, but I want to focus here on those who are going under the knife for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>\n<p>Being insecure about your vagina is not uncommon — I’m pretty sure we’ve all at some point in the transformation of our lady gardens wondered, “Is this normal?” — and I want to start off by telling you that it probably is normal, but if you’re still worried about it, go to the doctor and ASK! Don’t let this shit interfere with your sex life because you have to be comfortable with yourself in order to enjoy yourself!</p>\n<p>Easier said than done, right? It might seem to you that every vagina you’ve ever seen looks way more normal than yours does. Or perhaps someone once told you that your vagina looks odd? Let’s just think about that for a second: I mean, what is the authority that’s setting the precedent for what a “normal” vagina looks like? If your answer is “porn,” then you can give yourself a smack in the face because I don’t know how many times this needs to be reiterated: PORN IS FICTION. All of those vaginas have been primped, primed and filmed from certain angles in order to fit in with the aesthetic idea of “The Vagina” that our culture seems to have espoused.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First of all, let’s address the fucked-up-ness of having a completely hairless vagina with tiny pink labia that barely protrudes at all as our aesthetic ideal. What you’re striving for if you’re thinking that’s what your vagina should look like is to basically return to having unaroused and prepubescent genitals. Does that sound sexy?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a quick Wikipedia search for “labiaplasty” will tell you that the average length for the labia majora (the outside lips) can be between seven and 12 cm and for the labia minora (the inside ones) is between 20 and 100 mm. And those are only two parts of the whole. So basically, what constitutes a “normal” vagina is anything that falls within a huge spectrum, across a huge amount of variables, including color and shape. So that’s why I told you that your vagina, whatever it looks like, is probably normal. And yeah, because the vagina is such a complex thing, it usually looks like kind of a mess. But it’s still normal.</p>\n<p>So I suggest you all go and Google Image “labia” — as opposed to “pussy” or other less scientific terms — to get a real idea of what vaginas look like. Oh yeah, and relax, it’s just a vagina.</p>\n<p><em>Naomi Rea is a third-year English literature and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
