These are undoubtedly our new and deeply respected incoming freshmen, and so allow me to welcome any new freshmen readers (or am I supposed to refer to you as ‘first years’? Someone told me the term ‘freshmen’ was considered offensive. If this is the case, I will be continuing to offend you, freshmen) to the Wednesday Hump. This is where those without focus in class or without friends in the dining commons receive a weekly dose of some stranger’s sexual ponderings. It is a pleasure to have you added to the pool of potential mates — assuming of course you choose to assimilate into the dominant culture of this place — and I hope that you enjoy your sojourn in the twisted wonderland of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>But let’s talk business before pleasure. There is a choice before those new to the sociological experiment number 93117; this choice is whether to become one of the many substance-fueled hookup machines or to attempt to be normal in the conventional sense and not succumb to the pheromone-dominated atmosphere that is typical of college culture. The choice here, on a deeper level, is the classic one between security and freedom. Those who pick the former gain sexual security, comfort and a place to spend the night should they lock themselves out of their house. Those who prefer the latter gain experimental license, a fun game to play on boring nights and multiple places to spend the night should they lock themselves out of their house.</p>\n<p>So let us examine this, the fundamental conflict that differentiates the two primary breeds in Isla Vista, and why we might choose the side we do.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Biologically, it is argued that men of the college age should prefer sexual freedom to security and women vice versa. Unfortunately, these conclusions were drawn by men and women who had been quite effectively indoctrinated by Western cultural norms, and, in truth, I could bury one in biological arguments as to why women should be promiscuous and men monogamous. The point, of course, being that sociobiology is a poorly understood field at best, and should be regarded with the same vague boredom that most restrictively simplistic social theories deserve. If you would like further evidence that the biological arguments can be disproven, I present you with two common subspecies of human: the raging female sex addict and the annoying, clingy boyfriend.</p>\n<p>So what does drive us to be borderline hookers or cripplingly boring? Well, as borderline hookers, we get to explore aspects of human nature that are not only intellectually fascinating (because I know every single student at UCSB seeks intellectual ascension above all else), but also animalistically enthralling. The borderline hookers get to go out with the thrill of knowing that they might be getting lucky tonight — it’s a challenge, a game of skill and seduction. To anyone even vaguely familiar with the concept of ennui, this chance to play is a more powerful aphrodisiac than Spanish fly- infused chocolate dipped in oyster sauce (incidentally, delicious). And putting aside the allure of the challenge, the borderline hookers also benefit from the ability to experiment with impunity. Think you might be a chubby chaser? Go for it! Bright magenta hair? No problem. A threesome that involves exorbitant amounts of marshmallows? Hell yes, why not?</p>\n<p>But what of the other option? Security. Well, there is the obvious: emotional and physical comfort given on relative demand. You also don’t need to worry about accidentally contributing to the evolution of a new plethora of bacteria and fungi in your nether regions. And, finally, these repeated encounters with the same person are typically considered to hold more meaning. Commitment is a show of feelings and a symbol that you are willing to surrender massive amounts of fun simply because of how much you love someone.</p>\n<p>Now, my various grumpy, polyamorous readers, I’ll mention for you that this whole commitment thing is likely a result of cultural indoctrination. If you wish to reprogram the culture go right ahead. But, for the time being, most people view commitment, in the form of agreeing only to touch genitals with one other person, as the ultimate act of love. So there’s the allure of the second option: love, most people’s ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you, freshmen, which path to walk, but I can observe this: college is a time for experimentation and casting the net, but the goal of such a cast is often to reel in something real. My advice, then, is this: don’t settle, but don’t be afraid to settle down.</p>\n<p>Welcome to IV.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/","id":6402,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6401,6400,6399],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lessons From The Bachelor and the Older, Sexless Buddy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to keep his relationship with a girl casual.

Let’s call him a “noncommittal dating partner.” Understandably, however, he was often mistaken for a boyfriend by innocent bystanders.</p>\n<p>“Fine,” the girl thought. “He wants to keep it casual? I’ll show him casual.” So the girl didn’t call him during the week, and he used the freedom to attend college night at the local bowling alley. Now that I’ve mentioned college night, let’s back up for a minute. Now would be a good time to mention the fact that the man in question is 31 years old. While Wednesday night at Zodo’s is all well and good for 21-year-olds, there’s an unspoken age limit.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there he was at the bowling alley. Meanwhile, his non-girlfriend was at home partaking in her standard Wednesday evening activity: drinking herbal tea and pondering her coolness. “God, it is so awesome of me to let my noncommittal dating partner do his thing ALL THE TIME and never even question him about it. He’s so lucky to have me,” she thought, blissfully unaware that he was not in fact standing in the bowling alley, thinking about how laid-back she was. Rather, he was getting age-inappropriately drunk, trying to forget about his now-dysfunctional man parts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s rewind to a couple months before this particular night at Zodo’s. The girl and her noncommittal dating partner had been seeing each other for a few weeks at that point, and while they were having fun, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement that the relationship was not going to become serious. Though the girl didn’t tell the 31-year-old man at the time, there were a few reasons she was okay with the arrangement: A) He doesn’t read. Repeat after me: He does not read. In fact, the only thing he reads is <em>Maxim</em> magazine … when he’s enjoying some bathroom time; and then, of course, there’s B) He never complained when she made him watch <em>The Bachelor</em>, and actually seemed to enjoy the show. Unless you’re gay or my dad, that’s an unacceptable male hobby.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait, there’s one other thing that would validate being a grown ass man and voluntarily watching a ridiculous reality show aimed at 18-year-old girls: you’re doing it to get laid. There are probably millions of blue-blooded American men who spend their Monday evenings watching dudes with weird hair present desperate women with roses, all in the hopes that they’ll receive over-the-pants handy J’s during commercial breaks and then go full throttle once the rose ceremony is over. In this particular case, the girl hoped that was the reason for her noncommittal dating partner’s acceptance — and occasional downright enthusiasm — over watching <em>The Bachelor</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps naively, she thought she could have the best of both worlds: someone who was</p>\n<p>willing to watch a mindless reality show and engage in quickies whenever the dialogue got boring. With that in mind, she climbed on top of the man during a commercial break one Monday night. At first, he responded by gently making out with her and even moving to second base. But as soon as the bachelor’s voice boomed in the background, he couldn’t shove her away fast enough. Laughing, the girl (who thought that if she couldn’t get a commitment out of this man, she could at least get some decent sex) closed the laptop and reached for the zipper on his pants. Not laughing, he opened the laptop and informed the half-naked girl prepping for a blowjob that he “wants to see who will get the rose.”</p>\n<p>… What?</p>\n<p>She should have forced herself to break it off (literally, figuratively, metaphorically or all of the above) right then. But she mistook his sexual disinterest for reality show super-fandom and let it go. She would find out later that he was avoiding his not-so-fuck-buddy’s attempt at a BJ because he knew something she didn’t: he doesn’t like blowjobs. Or sex. [Editor’s note: The upcoming sentence was difficult to write and is likely to make everyone involved cringe and mutter condolences to the poor guy.] He didn’t want anything to touch his penis because he cannot keep it up.</p>\n<p>The next week, the same situation repeated itself. Girls pranced around on the TV screen, and the girl, still oblivious to any sort of long-term problem, got bored with the show and reached for his man area. He recoiled and muttered something about “issues” and “taking longer than other guys,” as he zipped up his pants and headed for the bathroom, probably to read Maxim and attempt to jack off. The naive, sexually-frustrated heroine of this saga sighed as she lay back on her pillows, thinking longingly of the men in her past who were blessed with functional plumbing.</p>\n<p>Later, when the nearly illiterate 31-year-old arrived at her house to have the break-up talk, the girl nodded, smiled and bit her tongue on more than one occasion. “This is really hard,” he said, fighting back tears. <em>No, it’s really not</em>, she thought, trying not to let her eyes travel to his man part region. “I’m just glad we’re getting out of this before I’m in too deep,” he continued. <em>No danger of that</em>, she thought with a sigh.</p>\n<p>So concludes the tale of the sexless fuck buddy. The girl, who doesn’t understand penises and probably never will, could tell countless other similar stories, but they all have the same moral: you can’t have sex with something that doesn’t want to, and you can’t not have sex with someone who doesn’t want a relationship. Reread that last sentence. Promise it makes sense.</p>\n<p><em>Dana Olsen is a UCSB graduate and an ex-Hump columnist.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/","id":6405,"author":{"id":490,"name":"Dana Olsen"},"related":[6404,6403,6402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thrusting to the Finish: Seniors Knock Boots Before Riding Into the Sunset","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s that time of the year again.

June gloom slowly creeps up, with the calendar bitching at you to get your life together while your hands desperately shove tequila shots down your throat in an attempt to shut your brain off and slow the clock down for just a few more hours.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry. I feel you. When anyone utters the words “Week Nine” I look around for the nearest sledgehammer. And taking a GE Spring Quarter of my senior year turned into the worst mistake of my college career, as I unknowingly signed up for a twice-a-week freshman social hour, where the question Have you thought about what you’ll do after college? is about as threatening to them as How many different pairs of pants do you think Santa Claus has?</p>\n<p>Not only is the end of the year a rough time for those of us who inexplicably don’t have a summer job after having applied for … no jobs, but it’s a heartbreaker for the spring fling-ers and the “This is definitely going to last the summer”-ers. Spring Quarter is like a magical, sexy, boiling stew of beer bongs and pantless fun, but like all other things, it must end. And when it does, it stings like a slapshot to the tender cheek of the unassuming frat pledge.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Damn does it hurt.</p>\n<p>For those of you with that special someone … Nah, nevermind.</p>\n<p>More appropriately, for those of you engaged in a non-specific sexual relationship that feels like a never-ending game of Twister — leaving you a little sore and a lot confused — well, my friends, you’re in for the clusterfuck of your life.</p>\n<p>If you’re getting down with a graduating senior, get ready to have your shit rocked.</p>\n<p>When you’re lying in bed Sunday morning with the words “So, once you graduate, what are we … ?” hovering above your lips, please, quickly think of an alternate ending, because that question is like Hiroshima to any fourth-year male with dreams of continued sexual prowess beyond college.

Last year, both my best friend and I received the “I’m a graduating senior” excuse, which at the time sounded about as reasonable as “I fell on her mouth.” But with the sage, newfound wisdom of my Spring Quarter senior standing, I can tell you that it’s an attitude I’ve begun to adopt myself.</p>\n<p>This stage of life is like a two-and-a-half-month-long trade-off between a war cry and a cry of terror. At first, you arrive at the glowing steps of Spring Quarter, eyes narrowed in determination, scanning the horizon for fresh blood and sniffing the air for the scent of Prestige. The war cry is issued. Then Week Five comes around and you’re cradling your alcohol-destroyed body, sobbing over your planner and cursing yourself for the moment you decided to pencil in a countdown to graduation right next to that inspirational quote printed at the top corner of every page.</p>\n<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and just the motivation I needed to say “Fuck it. YOLO.”</p>\n<p>All in all, h-in’ up with someone on the precipice of the real world can be an awful lot of fun. They’re game for most anything … anywhere … and ready to share their wild absurdity (as well as their bed) with their fellow classmates. But it can also be a rough ride — yeah, in that way too — for the younger ones, not fully understanding the mentality of the person who’s currently in or around their mouth (or any orafice for that matter).</p>\n<p>My word of advice: Share, but beware. As I was once told, we’re “not trying to hurt any feelings,” we’re just seniors. So YOLO, and check a few off the bucket list or help someone else get one in before their glory days are over.</p>\n<p><em>Jana Barrett has spent the last four years getting hard and going hard.

The activity is quite enjoyable, especially if you are as demented as me and my close friend and turn the experience into a party game, as it provides the opportunity to see just how twisted the psychosexual realm of this particular, somewhat troubling outlet of the gay population is. You will learn new terminology — Craigslist is like a crash course in gay code — as well as notice a very curious trend about the state of at least 80 percent of the under-24 population who has resorted to posting and posing their lust on the Internet.</p>\n<p>People are often shocked when I tell them I’ve hooked up with frat boys. They would probably be more shocked if I listed their actual names. There is a phenomenon in the gay community known as “turning,” in which a homosexual seduces a heterosexual. It’s not an uncommon thing, yet people never fail to be surprised, and often ask me how I do it. The truth is I exploit a weakness in our cultural logic. I exploit sexual fluidity, gender role malleability and our environment’s gluttonous fondness for casual, meaningless sex to expand the hidden desires of the “straight.”</p>\n<p>And, of course, I choose my targets well. I don’t (typically) choose the men who I know prefer women and “women only.” I’ve been in the game and was in the closet long enough to recognize people who have flirted with their own sexual confusion. Sure, I’ll occasionally hook up with someone I know will die the husband of some lady. But I would say that for the most part, I’m with someone who could just as easily marry a man and even maybe be happier for it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And yet, people still think I turn straight guys. So I will say it now: I am only turning closeted bisexuals and closeted gay men. I cannot speak about lesbians and I would rather be silent than wrong. But let us acknowledge this particular phenomenon, and examine the reasons, the means and the tools involved in maintaining the Closet Case.</p>\n<p>In 2012 California, one does not expect to be attacked by a governor’s son if they come out as gay. Still that decision often has great consequences. Coming out of the closet involves surrendering the following: claims to what has been culturally instilled in us as the fundamental masculine trait, virtually all available prototypes of ideal relationships, the culturally ideal relationship and what has been framed as a fundamental part of identity — one’s sexual preference.</p>\n<p>In shifting from “straight” to “gay,” one sacrifices an unspeakably large amount. For those gay men who prefer the shooting range to Forever 21, this sacrifice can be too great. Our gendered society has coupled the preference to have sex with women with strength, stoicism and the multitude of traits associated with masculinity. The coupling is so strong that I have heard “I don’t care if they’re gay, as long as they aren’t those faggy gays” in my own home, and variations of this sentiment throughout my interactions with “masculine” men.</p>\n<p>This implication is of course that being gay carries with it “faggy” traits. Neglecting these traits then is the only way to make your homosexuality palatable to the masculine hierarchs. I’ve known those whose friend groups consist exclusively of hyper-masculine, gym-obsessed men (behavior that is in itself a red flag for sexual conflict), and they would not compromise their entire social standing by coming out. Indeed, even people I know to be accepting of gays are horrified when I casually suggest that maybe the reason their bro doesn’t get with women very often is because he doesn’t actually want to.</p>\n<p>But even assuming that someone can define one’s masculinity intrinsically and not by an external code, there is still immeasurable loss involved in the coming out process. Those considering coming out must consciously acknowledge that they will never have access to the picture-perfect, Disney-portrayed relationships that pop culture views as perfect. You will never have nor be the prince and princess according to that cultural narrative. One of the most painful experiences, however, involves realizing that a woman who may already be in your life isn’t the one, despite how gorgeous and down-to-earth she is — no matter how goddamn perfect she may seem.</p>\n<p>So instead you face the unknown of constructing a relationship — a balanced, happy relationship — from imagination, trial-and-error and prayer. For masculine gays who are attracted to masculinity, they have no reference. In coming out they must admit to themselves that they cannot use basic relationship models to help them in their life. It’s a frightening revelation.</p>\n<p>And because our society is obsessed with sexual orientation classes, this choice is typically irreversible. Once you’ve admitted you’re attracted to men, you are gay or bisexual. My own sister admitted she wouldn’t feel comfortable in a relationship with a bisexual because she’d be insecure about his interests. My sister, for reference, is one of the most compassionate and liberal people I know. The corruption is deep — many do not have the prejudice, but many more do — and our strict system of sexuality forces those who want access to their same-sex desires to take on all the prejudices in their simple choice to be honest.</p>\n<p>So that’s the why, and now the how. The casual sex dominant in I.V. and the massive amounts of drug use allow closeted gays to remain hidden indefinitely. I have a fond memory of one of my straight friends talking about how his friend only hooks up with women when he’s “drunk enough” because his standards are so high. Yes, right, your heterosexual friend must get drunk to lower his standards, to make kissing the notoriously gorgeous women of Santa Barbara stomachable. The ones who are closeted can produce convincing illusions because they can simply drug their souls into oblivion and then play the part. After 19 beers, most people would have sex with a curvaceous oak tree, and yet since drunken sex is normalized in I.V. and emotional considerations aren’t even conscious thoughts, the illusion is perfect.</p>\n<p>By exploiting sexual fluidity and neglecting emotional desires entirely, the closet cases are in an ideal position to continue positioning themselves above women. And in 10 years, when partying can’t be their whole life anymore, they will have to face the truth and join the legions of late-in-life masculine gay men this country boasts.</p>\n<p>But, you know what? Fuck that. I’ve watched enough people suffer at the hands of our society’s weird sexual hang-ups. I’ve had friendships decay, relationships wither and potential flames flicker out because of the poisonous Puritanism injected into the sexual culture of this country hundreds of years ago. Every day, I reflect on the people I’ve known who still struggle to find that inner peace that will let them be as they are. Every day, I wonder if I could have done something different — crafted the right words to uplift the fearful — and become their shelter, and they mine. And every day, I maintain this vague hope that I can do better the next time I meet someone who is so deeply alone.</p>\n<p>But I know that I really can’t do anything to help the closet cases. The forces caging them are bigger than me. They are greater than any queer activist group. They are more obvious than Pride parades and more subtle than the difference between being happy and being at peace. Change of the magnitude required for true liberation won’t happen overnight, just like one night with a closet case won’t assuage his inner turmoil.</p>\n<p>Straight people: Be allies. Do not pretend to truly understand the challenges of coming out, but know your support can mean the difference between someone finding love in high school, and ripping apart a family in 20 years because Dad finally couldn’t do it anymore.</p>\n<p>Open gays: If anything in this article was new to you, please take it into consideration when you frame your activism. The depth of this issue won’t be touched by tactics of glitter bombs and giant floats. Those are necessary for certain issues, but a sledgehammer will not always be able to replace a scalpel.</p>\n<p>And to the closet cases: I’m sorry that this is where you are. But by that promised land of equality I hope to see in my lifetime, I hope that you will let yourself be openly loved by that guy who you’ve secretly wanted since the day you found him at freshman orientation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

All of this theory is leading up to something — a part of my sex life an astonishingly large amount of people ask me about. But as I said in my first article, I want to do such specific parts of sex justice in my discourse, and so I try to create a basis to work with. Gender roles, being virtually built into the mechanics of humping, represent a significant portion of this basis, and so with this article I shall address one final piece of the puzzle that goes into the gendered thinking of our society.</p>\n<p>When I last wrote, I spoke of the trivialization of sex in I.V. culture and challenged readers to thrust once more, with feeling. With this piece, I want to look at actual relationship models in American society as they are presented to us, the general public.</p>\n<p>I do this for two reasons. First, it will, in its course, reveal a very salient issue very few people realize a subset of the homosexual population faces, and if I raise more awareness then the Council will give me a gold star. I’m only two gold stars away from free tickets to Broadway. The other reason is less politically motivated: I feel looking at this subject might be useful in directly illustrating how deeply our sexual culture has been influenced by historical assumptions. Raising that form of awareness could do wonders for improving the state of psychological health in our world.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So let us look at how one can secure intercourse with another human, a process more commonly known as “dating.” Typically, this phenomenon is observed when the genital-defined man asks the genital-defined female on a date. Some fancy dinner later, they are having sex and there is much rejoicing. It’s a model we know well, due to its incredible prevalence in fiction and reality.</p>\n<p>But what happens if, say, our man is shy and awkward, and the woman he’s interested in is strong and forward. Then his personality is in direct conflict with the only model really available to us, and suddenly there’s no sex for anyone. This, readers, is not a good result. Not having sex is rarely a good result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And why is it that when I speak to my female friends, they seem to expect the man to take charge in the dating situation? Even some of my most direct friends expect this behavior — it is odd, because in doing this they intrinsically reduce their chance of getting ass, which strikes me as unfortunate.</p>\n<p>Now, it is 2012, so hopefully most of us understand that if a chick wants to ask a guy out, she can. And yes, she can — not on paper. But many women still expect men to take the reins. Why? Here’s my theory: Television, story books and certain corporations responsible for children’s entertainment still put forth the man-asks-woman-out model as normal. Anyone who wants to differ? Go for it. Just figure it out yourself and let the normal people be normal. This lack of support for the “abnormal” self-perpetuates people’s tendencies to conform to a certain gendered behavior.</p>\n<p>But let’s introduce another conflict with the arbitrarily named Cis-Me (it rhymes with Disney) model of romance. Consider two men. Using the laundry list of “masculine” versus “feminine” features, we can cast both of these men as being dominantly masculine. They also happen to be gay and attracted to other masculine men. They are attracted to each other.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, you’ve now read the one situation for which our romance system is the most ill-suited for addressing. Think now. Give me one not-hipster example of a masculine man/masculine man romance story. They don’t happen in our fiction. They once happened — consider Patroclus and Achilles in The Iliad — but our culture has since made the possibility of romance between two strong men disappear. Between two feminine females is rare, but occasionally occurs. A relationship between a masculine man and feminine man can be found on “Glee.” But two manly men? Your best bet is gay porn (and there you are likely to find three or four manly “straight” men anyway).</p>\n<p>I actually exaggerate slightly. To my knowledge there is, in fact, one company that has attempted to fictionally model inter-masculine romances. Bioware, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts, has arguably done more for socially assisting masculine gays with their video games than any other fiction production agency. But that’s one very specific company whose efforts won’t reach most of the population. Many of our mass-public socialization devices, like television, literature (except maybe Shakespeare) and movies — offer little to no advice on how to break with the man-asks-woman-out model of relationships.</p>\n<p>And this romance system self-perpetuates. Assertive women are conditioned to just wait until a man asks them out. Shy men typically have to stand by until they, by chance, are comfortable enough with a woman to ask her out (by which time they are usually Indefinitely Friend-Zoned). In both cases, the participants ultimately fill their role. Even in homosexual cases, the Cis-Me model can be adapted to work if there is clearly a more feminine and more masculine participant.</p>\n<p>People who shouldn’t be forced into this hierarchal prototype of romance end up being pushed into obeying it. The only people who don’t end up pushed into it are the ones who simply cannot. That is, men like those from the earlier anecdote, or two feminine lesbians who are attracted to each other.</p>\n<p>True equality will never be had until the societal subconscious acknowledges not only the existence of, but equal dominance of, non-Cis-Me models of romance and sexual desire. And the social subconscious isn’t just about gays. It’s about interracial relationships. It’s about strong women and shy men. This subspace of thinking is the ultimate psychological battlefield, from which our laws and prejudices are born, and upon which the final conflicts for equality will be resolved.</p>\n<p>So readers, it is my simple wish for you to acknowledge this. Be aware of this realm of subtlety, and how it will teach your son to be a certain way and your daughter to be another. The social subconscious shapes us from the cradle, to the bedroom, to the altar and perhaps even all the way to the deathbed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

But the uniqueness of our explicit ventures here in this little town of wonderful misfits is that they prepare a wildness in us that will be fondly (and desperately) held onto — like that last saliva-diluted plastic handle at the party — for as long as our livers permit us to keep on keepin’ on.</p>\n<p>I.V. is a magical place. Yeah, I said it. And I’ll continue to say it till my UCSB sweatshirt has moth holes in it and “Loopy” better describes my mental state than my absurd, vodka-laden, bar-hopping Saturday afternoon with a bunch of lovable disasters I’m proud to call my best friends.</p>\n<p>This weekend reminded me of the damn awesome-as-shit spirit of you people — both beneath the sheets and, you know, in life. There’s something remarkable about seeing that guy who used to end up with a mop duct-taped to his torso every weekend return with a vengeance after three years out of college. And that old flame? Hell yeah, I hope you hit yours too, because there are few things so excellent as the realization of “Damn, that was worth all the emotional trauma it resulted in a couple years ago.”</p>\n<p>So, to the middle-aged troll at the Study Hall, to the alum I’ll never forget (at least until I get around to washing my bedsheets), to all of us who are still here, waking up Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning, questioning our character while we scour last night’s clothing for any telling stains: I salute you. And I will be the first to buy you a drink next year.</p>\n<p>Jana Barrett is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s May 2. Writing that fills me with a degree of nausea I’ve never before known in my life. I’ll find a job I love and keep in touch with the important people; that doesn’t worry me. I’m much more worried about my social habits. Isla Vista is a unique and magnificent place — but how well will that translate into the work world?</p>\n<p>I have a very distinct vision of how my work parties will unfold. My nightmare transpires like this: I’ve found a job I love and am slowly but surely proving to my colleagues that I’m cool, mostly with marginally offensive penis jokes. Thursday night rolls around and a co-workers innocently and fatally invites me to a happy hour gathering. I prepare to take it easy this first time, reminding myself that I’m actually much more fun to be around when my eyes aren’t crossed and I’m not slurring offensive “would you rather”s about railing your own father. We arrive at the bar, I order a beer, one thing leads to the next and BAM, I’m taking body shots off my boss. God forbid I’m ever in a professional setting with a wine bag … do adults drink Franzia?</p>\n<p>As Gauchos, we’ve spent four years perfecting a very specific skill set: making obliteration sexy. Perfecting may be a generous term, but we didn’t get into UCLA, and perfection is relative. Unfortunately, LinkedIn has yet to recognize blacked-out blowies as a legitimate professional attribute, so I guess we’ll just have to adjust. This isn’t anything to get discouraged about — instead, let’s view it as a challenge. There will come a day when you have to feel a bit guilty about boning down in a grimy bathroom, but why dwell on the future?</p>\n<p>Freshmen: You spent the last two quarters regressing from Smirnoff to Heritage, while struggling to balance three bullshit classes per quarter. Don’t worry if you haven’t figured out how to incorporate sloshed sex yet — that’s what sophomore year is for.</p>\n<p>Sophomores: If you’re on track, slutty is no longer a label but a lifestyle. Well done.</p>\n<p>Juniors: At some point this past year, you felt directionless. You entered into a losing philosophical debate with yourself about the purpose of drinking so much and struggled to see your self-worth. Well snap out of it; you’re a Gaucho, goddammit.</p>\n<p>Seniors: You’ve come to terms with the fact that you no longer deserve your parents’ love and are panicking imagining a world of courtship and consequences. To you I suggest going out with a bang — bone down in the library, Bill’s bus, OTT’s bathroom and your roommate’s bed ASAP. There’s something to be said for packing it in at the end. You know, taking some for the road.</p>\n<p>In reality, we’re going to take a lot away with us from UCSB — a degree, a wealth of knowledge and an outlook on seizing the moment that dangerously flirts with alcoholism. I talk big about conforming to professional standards, but let’s be real: It’s going to take years to undo our undergrad damage. And if that’s going to make me a ho in the workplace, then so be it.</p>\n<p>Jenna Ryan is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1332400935\" data-slb-group=\"46564\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46565\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/screen-shot-2012-05-01-at-9-38-59-pm-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=1219%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1219,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=888%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-46565\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1-250x142.png?resize=250%2C142\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"142\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=1024%2C583&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?w=1219&amp;ssl=1 1219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46564\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46564\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/","id":6394,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6393,6392,6391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Where to Turn When BROing and HOing Have Lost Their Appeal","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most unfortunately, in order to speak of this next topic, I will have to address something fetid and repulsive.

Much of the sex that occurs in Isla Vista occurs in the absence of actual emotional attachment or, indeed, actual knowledge of a person’s name, and I am the first to admit that I am very guilty of indulging such simple solutions to the wayward desire. Intrinsically, there is nothing wrong with this — it is a natural desire to have sex and, if one is cautious, one is perfectly entitled to have as much consensual sex as they wish and forget every other variable. But entitlement never won over a Nobel committee, so let’s look at the other side and glance at the possible reasons behind the model.</p>\n<p>Most people raised in American culture are familiar with the cultural ideals put forth to young children. A young, sexy woman is swept off her feet by some amazing stallion of a man, and they live happily ever after. As an organism grows within the culture, the ideal will change somewhat — occasionally even so far as it is the man being swept up by some creative, quirky, perfect woman — but ultimately the end result is the same: you find someone faultless, you are happy, it is forever. And ever. And ever.</p>\n<p>My regular readers will immediately spot a flaw in this ideal. The Posit of Gender/Sex Dissociation, among an uncountable number of other psychological factors, impedes this ideal’s overarching plausibility. Somewhat fortunately, our parents’ generation took the brunt of that particular psychological mutilation and is attempting to sew together their pitiable, overly idealized psyches with an astonishingly high divorce rate and one-in-five emotional disorder statistics. But our generation felt the effect, because to counter this idea of eternal love, we formulated what I shall now coin as the Boozing, Rolling, Opiating and Humping then Omitting method, or BRO and HO* method. The process of drugging up, having sex and forgetting the consequences can be drawn as a parallel to the teenage sexual liberation in the 1950s in response to the Stepford-Wives style conservatism that dominated that era. And indulging in the typical BRO and HO* night is objectively quite pleasurable, but why is it becoming the norm?</p>\n<p>It is stereotypical, but admittedly statistically verifiable, to consider gays a relatively promiscuous people. This tendency can be easily derived from cultural axioms, and I would happily do so if I didn’t have a word limit. But ultimately when I wake up in the morning, and roll over to find whoever I managed to bring home last night, my thought usually isn’t “Damn, my life is awesome.” It’s “Water … please, God … water!” and then “Could I date this person?” The answer is typically no. If it weren’t for the BRO and HO* method, I would never have survived conversation with this person for longer than five minutes. And when I realize just how fantastically boring I find them, I have to use the same brainpower I spent figuring out how to get home with them to undoing their sudden and bizarre desire to sleep in my bed as long as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>My studies indicate I am not alone in this experience. The BRO and HO* culture has permeated every gender, every sex and every sexual orientation I’ve observed. And this is bad. Sex is fun, natural and a great way to blow off steam, but the fact it’s now largely assumed to be a commodity — “Dude, I so hope I get laid tonight” — is irredeemably unsettling to me. There is a fine line between sexual empowerment and forgetting the most exquisite parts of sex — a physical manifestation of the deepest sort of bond. I am not saying stop your BROing and HOing, I’m just asking you why you’re doing it. Is it fear of commitment, with which obsession spawned for our parents an unmatched era of over-committing and divorce? Or are you actually without any desire to have something meaningful? Or do you, and this is the opinion I would hope all possess, merely view this casual sex as transitive and honestly desire emotionally valuable sex in the future?</p>\n<p>The phrasing of this last statement is essential. I am not promoting, denouncing or forming any opinion on monogamy. Emotional sex is not created by putting a ring on it (someone’s finger not … you get it), but formed through an actual, non-ethanol based chemistry between two humans. I once hooked up with a guy and, to this day, consider the sex we had to have been in every way fulfilling, due to his energy and passion and, for lack of a better word, sheer attractiveness. Attraction is maximized in emotional sex — whether it happens one Saturday at four in the morning or every Friday night after you go out on a fun double date with the neighbors just to spice things up.</p>\n<p>I guess what I’m saying, readers, is I have a new ideal to supersede the pretty princess and her Prince Charming. Emotion and sex are intrinsically tied, and we all deserve to have both satiated. By whatever mechanism, find that for yourself. Identify that person you’ve been after since September of freshman year, break out some drinks and when the light reflects from her eyes in just the right way, or he smirks and shows off his perfect bone structure for the ninth time, then fucking go for it. If you’re rejected, you have BRO and HO to fall back on.</p>\n<p>I’ve been dancing around the word love this entire article, but now here’s my challenge to you before I speak again in two weeks: go find some love. For the duration of 15 minutes or until you die, give your heart as much as a role as your genitals in the sex. Just try it out, because I hear it’s some kinky shit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*The term “BRO and HO” is not meant to be misogynistic, but rather is a satirical use of two terms that most, if not all, UCSB students should be familiar with. If you were offended as a woman I sincerely apologize. If you were offended as a man then I am mildly curious to meet you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1695187794\" data-slb-group=\"46378\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46379\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/fuckingcuddling-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"FUCKINGcuddling (1)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;“No, We’re Not Having Sex, We’re Just Cuddling So Fucking Hard That His Dick Is Inside Me, In Case My Roommate Walks Into the Living Room for Water”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=888%2C568&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-46379\" title=\"FUCKINGcuddling (1)\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1-250x160.jpg?resize=250%2C160\" width=\"250\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?resize=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C655&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/","id":6396,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6395,6394,6393],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I Never Tell a Lie, Except for Those Times When I Do","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The average person tells seven lies a day.

I’m not sure if I read that from a Snapple fact or if I just made that up. But anyway, I didn’t believe it at first, until I started listening to half the shit I say. And turns out, it’s probably right. And I’m likely above average.</p>\n<p>Sometimes lying is fun, but almost always, lying makes you seem a hell of a lot cooler than you really are. Well, that is, until you get caught.</p>\n<p>1. The Athlete: Everyone loves an athlete. It’s a completely forgivable category. You can be a douchebag, closet weirdo or have the IQ of a donkey, but as long as you have the jersey, you’re a fuckin’ stud. But even if you have the makeup of an athlete (chiseled bod, that stupid ass arrogance for no reason at all and excessive grab-ass behavior — regardless of gender), you’ve got nothin’ if you peaked in high school. So while you’re talkin’ to Miss Dick-Sucking-Lips on the couch, you might have to throw a curveball. “Yeah, I’m on the basketball team, it’s really no big deal.” And as she scoots close enough to you to potentially perform a ballcuzi, you choke. “I mean, I’m on the I.M. team, but it’s cool. We won our bracket. You’re still going home with me, right?” Don’t be surprised if she retaliates with, “Let’s put it this way, does a priest make a good babysitter?” (Sorry, too close to Easter; brb going to hell.)</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2. The Virgin: Although it’s hard to believe that a) this rare breed exists in Isla Vista and b) they’d be willing to give it up the same night that they met you, you can’t beat this one if you play it off right. Disclaimer: If you don’t, you’ll end up beating it yourself. Meeting a virgin is like entering into the apocalypse. No matter how much you think you’re prepared, you’re still fucked. Wading through the excitement and ego boost, you all of a sudden land on the holy shit freak out that this person is about to remember you forever. But, then, of course, once you’re actually in bed, they start bending like a yoga teacher, hanging upside down from their sex swing, throwing out moves you’ve only seen on T.V. programs. And I’m talkin’ the expensive ones.</p>\n<p>3. The Writer: This one has so many different angles to work with. If you’re a guy, you look sentimental and smart, and if you’re a girl, well, likely you’re smart enough to steal my thunder and play off that you’re Elizabeth Brooks. Clothes come off, and if you’re real wild, sheets may come off too, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “Fuck. What did I just get myself into here? Did I just inadvertently sign up for a Dirty Sanchez? I should’ve done my research on my fake job. Shit.” Well, word to the wise, be prepared for my new favorite question, “Oh my God, are you going to write about this?” Why, yes. Yes I am. It’s on like Groupon.</p>\n<p>4. The Slayer: There’s a fine line between creepy and crafty. Make enough sexual innuendos: crafty. Walk into Jack in the Box in the nude and throw open your robe: creepy. But sometimes, if your little innuendos come off too strong, you might as well start investing in a cheap cotton robe. Talking a big game is lying’s sneaky, twatty sister that no one invited. If you have no intention of following through, you’re just a classic cock-tease, or, you’re in too deep. While you’re jammin’ at a party to “Club Can’t Handle Me” (because enough time has passed for it to be okay to get excited about this song again), you might want to hold back on the, “Yeah, well, if the club can’t handle you, I bet your bottom fuckin’ dollar my hotel room can,” unless you have Gold Cab’s number on speed dial. It comes down to two choices: run, or rail and bail. If you’re gonna lie, you gotta commit.</p>\n<p>5. The Magician: This is one you don’t see very often, unless you’re into David Blaine — or some magical panty dropper effect that I’m unaware of — but mostly just David Blaine. And while it seems far-fetched, and probably some level of just plain uncool to pretend to be a magician, think about what it would be like to encounter one. You’d start out like, “Yeah, sweet, other than pulling a Houdini and blowing a load in a girl’s face, what other little ‘magic’ do you have?” But what if they were a real magician? You might find out what the fuck actually happens when they saw someone in half. Think of all of the secrets you would finally have answers to! Maybe you could join in on one of the acts, hit the road and end up in Vegas. Oh, the possibilities. Just make sure you at least have the abraca-chicken one down before you go big.</p>\n<p>Deceiving someone to get them into bed is just plain cruel. But “I love you,” “I’ll pull out” or “I’m on the pill” are all a little too overused to be taken seriously. So get creative. It may be bad, but hey, it’s fun to do bad things.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/","id":6391,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6390,6389,6388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Don’t Base Your Desires on the Gender Binary: Go For What Gets You Off","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nation.

I come before you today to offer a study that will revolutionize science. Its elegance, infallibility, and pure genius will force the Nobel committee to establish an entirely new field for prizes – one for awesome – and I will be its first ever winner. I give you…the nail test.</p>\n<p>In seventh grade, I was asked to examine my fingernails. Upon turning my palm to face me and curling my fingers down, I was pronounced a heterosexual male. Of course, five years later I would disprove this famed research when wrestling with a friend degraded (actually, upgraded) into possibly the hottest situation I’ve ever found myself in, but while I was an aberration, no one can deny the complete and irreconcilable differences the nail test has demonstrated – neigh proven! – between men and women. So let us examine this idea called gender further.</p>\n<p>Since becoming licensed as a homosexual, I have found that a large sect of my people – a sect I shall arbitrarily call the Closets – are utterly obsessed with their appearance. They are thoroughly concerned with a certain image – one that makes the terms ‘bro,’ ‘man,’ and ‘dude,’ the most important words in the lexicon – and I imagine they must be in their bathroom for hours tailoring to his appearance. It is amusing how staunchly they stick to this personality, for even when we’re alone together, and they are fully aware I know of their attraction to men, they maintain their image. A second sect – I shall, once again very arbitrarily, call this one the Flames – has always astounded me with their stoicism and cavalier bravery in the face of a culture that subconsciously rejects them. They are warriors for their freedom to wear feather boas and rainbow jeans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And so, the appearance-obsessed Closets and the independent Flames provide an interesting comparison. From my brief description, you have hopefully noticed the clear winners in masculinity are the Closets. This is confirmed by their use of the word ‘man’ in place of any other pronoun. Yet something seems wrong about this conclusion. Perhaps the nail study is wrong, and trying to assign genders to sexes is just plain idiotic.</p>\n<p>I mean, I’m gay, so I should be like a chick? One of the feminine qualities is a lack of stoicism. So I want to challenge every straight dude in my audience to do the following: step on a nail, take a scalpel, cut the nail (inch deep) out of your foot, and use super glue as stitches (please don’t actually do this). I did it, and I’m gay, so every straight man shouldn’t even flinch during the procedure. So the fact I have sex with men does not preclude my ability to ‘take it like a man’ (my dirty mind really just had fun with that phrase). And then there’s my friend, who could, put simply, beat your ass to pulp. This is good, because you’ll want her to when she starts talking about the new shoes bought. And if you want to be utterly owned in logic and analysis, call up my buddy Anne – she’ll hand your manly ass to you on a platter. And what’s with all of those super rational men sticking by their psycho girlfriends; stop crying, just break up with the bitch because she’s really not worth it.</p>\n<p>I would hope my proposals don’t consciously shock you. If they do then I’m really sorry you exist. But the gender roles aren’t supposed to be conscious. They are a cultural undertow of thought. Look outside on a Saturday night and watch boys beat their chests and girls act (key word there) weak and needy to lure in mates. The breeding rituals of Isla Vista (not, mind you, the breeding rituals of <em>Homo Sapiens</em>) necessitate gendered behavior. We <em>accept</em> gender aberrant behavior but still view it as aberrant. This is an incorrect view, and if you think you can argue it is correct, I will happily engage you in lively debate.</p>\n<p>So to the next guy I bring home, don’t bother with the overwhelming urge to assert your masculinity. I tend to be attracted to ambition, individuality, and stoicism – my friend once pointed out all the women I’d go straight for were also capable of murdering me. If I’ve decided to be with you, I know you’re a ‘masculine’ guy. Hell, you’re man enough to admit you want to be with me despite what society says.</p>\n<p>And to all, gay or straight, I want to you this. Consider the traits you find sexually appealing, and then critically examine whether you seek the trait because you like the trait, or because it subconsciously comforts your conditioned need for the gender binary. Overturning this concept of masculine/feminine traits might allow the Closets to dissociate being gay with being actualized as a man, and accept themselves. And that’s good for all of us (mostly me), because Closets are typically very energetic in bed.</p>\n<p>But, go ahead and look at your nails. I still want that damn prize.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/","id":6393,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6392,6391,6390],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Roommate Double-Double: Careful Where That Appetite Takes You","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Logic is the devil of language.

Because it would make perfect sense for you to fall in love with your hookup’s roommate. Talk about a classic mix-up.</p>\n<p>Have you ever woken up after a night of (self-proclaimed) “slay city” and looked across the room only to find the most beautiful Lamb of God imaginable lying in the other bed? I know what you’re thinking in that situation, and I’m right there with ya. Yeah, shit son, you went for the wrong roommate. Now? Welcome to the hardest phase of time management you’ll face in your entire college career: swiftly making the transition from roommate number one to roommate number two.</p>\n<p>Upon first meeting each other, you and roommate number two overlook the, “Duhhhhhh, what’s your major?” bullshit, because you very clearly can’t have each other. Cordial schmordial. But, regardless, there’s instant attraction, and before you know it, outta nowhere, it turns into need it, want it, gotta have it. The attraction is mutual, because hello, it makes perfect sense. It’s like solving a Rubik’s Cube — shit finally lines up and then you suddenly can’t suppress the desire to completely fuck it up again.

Because, inevitably, you’ll get caught. It’s always this drawn-out, painfully elaborate process that starts out innocently with roommate number one coming over to your house and asking where you bought these “specialty” condoms. Your casual reply of “Pshh, I bought them” is the last nail in the coffin. Turns out they’re these super fuckin’ rare, can-only-get-them-in-China, heavy-duty, keep-the-babies-AWAY condoms. To which you try to immediately recover with, “Uh, ya. Haha. Ha. Funny story, true story, actually, they started selling them at I.V. Market, who knew right? WHO KNEW?”</p>\n<p>But I mean, once things start moving past the classic OTPHJ (over the pants hand job) stage, it starts becoming, “Listen, my roommate is in class, get your ass over here, NOW.” And then you’re free to bang, and not just bang, puhlease. Forget hearing your standard cup caking through the wall. Ha, child’s play. We’re talking hearing-long-distance-headboard-banging-against-the-wall status. Heyo, ‘sup world.</p>\n<p>You think you’re so suave in keeping it on the major down low. But then shit starts getting all kinds of uncomfortable. In front of roommate number one, you casually mention to roommate number two that they should “draw you,” and it’s like, “Oh, God, not actually. I meant the app!” But even Draw Something wants you to be together. Every three coin word is soulmate … or marriage … or skeeball … okay that was a wild card, but all you want is that goddamn neon color package, so you have to pick them. God. Life is hard.</p>\n<p>And then, despite all this, roommate number one is still way too confident in the hookup relationship, because they somehow remain incredibly oblivious, when everyone at UCSB (including Chancellor Yang) has caught onto what is going on. So number one starts shit-talking to number two. “Hey, bro, I’m wearing Velcro shoes and still getting laid while you go home and beat it tonight.” And all the while, roomie number two is thinking, “Uh, yeah, to the nudes your girlfriend sent me last night. Yeah, yeah, later bro.”</p>\n<p>Then, when all three of you are in public together, the two of you secret lovahs get close enough to start passionately making out, but end up high-fiving instead. ‘Cause as much as you want to finally expose the relationship, it’s like, what are you supposed to say at this point? “I accidentally slipped it in?” Yeah, and I “accidentally” parked my car in my neighbor’s garage … claaaassic me.</p>\n<p>But the real turning point is when they start to make you think all kinds of crazy shit. Like, woah, I would even watch American Idol for this person. Holy shit, I might even go so far as to pick a favorite and start arguing with the judges. No. No way, this is not real life.</p>\n<p>Once that happens, you’re done for. You’ve committed and that only means that roommate number one is bound to walk into your classic afternoon delight sesh.

T...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I spent a long while trying to think of what to write for my first sex article for the Daily Nexus, and as I thought about it, I was forced to think about what, exactly, a sex article should cover. There is the obvious: sex and my various escapades in the matter. But without any context I could not really think of a good way to frame my experiences. And so, particularly as a queer male, I think a good starting point would be to try to look critically at this thing called sexuality, try and pin down a good definition for it and maybe establish a solid perspective from which I can write intelligently about the subject.</p>\n<p>If someone asks me what my sexual orientation is, I tend to say I’m gay, but this doesn’t come close to covering it. For one, I’ve had sex with women — a decent amount of sex with women — and my fondness for female breasts would have gotten my homosexual license revoked if not for my ability to sing any song from “Wicked” on command. I like sex with girls, yet I still will identify myself as gay. So I asked myself: why not consider myself bisexual? I used to say I was bi, but now I just say I’m gay — why? This brings me to the first aspect of sexuality I want to look at: the difference between sex and sexuality. A crucial difference is the emotional aspect. Getting it on with someone isn’t exactly difficult, and most guys will rise to the occasion with the proper stimulation. But when I picture myself settling down, it’s with a man, and while I have loved many women, the only person I’ve ever been in love with did not have matching chromosomes. That makes me gay, right? Maybe, at least emotionally … for now …</p>\n<p>Like I said, I’ve already redefined my sexuality twice: from straight to bi, from bi to gay. Most people, “gay” or “straight,” will say that I took a natural path in coming out. This does not change the fact that out of my last three sexual partners, one was female, and she was easily the best in bed. And while I “came out” last May, my heterosexual escapade happened in December, so maybe I went back to being bi for a while. Or maybe, and I think this is the answer, sexuality can’t be nailed down as constant, at least with respect to me and I assume to many others. A wise man once told me “people are wavelength and varying,” and I am inclined to agree. When you add in the qualifier “people are wavelength, varying and horny,” it seems to be a recipe for some serious sexual ambiguity. This is the same sexual ambiguity that I rely on when it’s a lonely weekend, that straight frat guy who keeps “accidentally” bumping into me is pretty hot and my roommate is going to spend the night with his own lovely lady.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I suppose the point I’m trying to hit home is that from where I’m standing and from where I’ve been (horizontally), physical sexuality seems pretty variable. Controlling for consideration of homophobia, contemporary definitions of masculinity, early childhood conditioning and our country’s puritanical roots, the data would indicate whom you bed is very much in your head. I acknowledge there is a chance people are born straight or born gay, but if I’m forced to acknowledge that, I will, at the very least, demand this quantized system of gay-straight-bi be updated to a continuum model (1-10, with every decimal in between). But that’s not the whole story. If the psycho-socio-bio model explains every other aspect of human nature, why can’t nature only point sexuality in a direction, but have psychological and sociological factors define it? (A topic, perhaps, for another article.)</p>\n<p>To summarize and conclude, I’ll leave you with this: my roommate used to tell me a girl’s sexuality is like a wet noodle, to which I would respond a dude’s sexuality is like a dry noodle. Boil it (you can add alcohol for flavor) for a bit and it’ll bend pretty easy. Physical sexuality, dear readers, could be construed to have the structural integrity of pasta. Just think about it — chew it over — is all I’m asking.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/","id":6399,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6398,6397,6396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Six Degrees of Isla Vista: You Wish It Were Only A Theory","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Have you ever been sitting around, shootin’ the shit with your friends, when all of a sudden you stop and realize you’ve all essentially hooked up with one another?

All right, before you judge me, think about it. But don’t think too hard, or you’ll end up with a fucked up web of borderline creepy, incest friendships.</p>\n<p>I mean it kind of makes sense. Put a bunch of ridiculously good looking people in the same room surrounded by handles of shitty whiskey (it’s always the whiskey that gets ya), and people are bound to get handsy. “Oh we’re just so close, he’s like my brother, hehehe,” as he’s slapping your ass and grabbing your tits. “It’s fine, we’d neeeever hook up.” And then you’re getting railed on the kitchen table. Great family dynamic, yo. Count me in for Christmas dinner.</p>\n<p>There’s always the group of guys and the group of girls that all hang out together, and there’s a shit-ton of sexual tension, but everyone behaves themselves. Until one little duo decides to stop being a dick tease, and then everyone’s fucked. Literally. All it takes is that one brave soldier to let his little soldier take a stand, and then everything suddenly becomes fair game. You can’t cross that line unless you want your sexual innuendos to start being received as come-ons. And there’s always that moment when you’re laughing and hanging out and all of a sudden you get a mental image of your best friend.

Usually girls will give out every last detail, not because we’re sick fucks, but because think about it, we’re girls, and we never shut up. Guys give the bare minimum. But when guys become Eskimo brothers, they get all bent out of shape about their igloo. “How does my dick taste, bro? How does it taste?” You’d never see a girl walk up and punch her friend in the arm and go, “Yeah, how’d my pussy taste?” Sorry, I just vomited.</p>\n<p>Instead, girls go completely silent. They don’t want to share details, because of the fear that we actually suck in bed, and all of our stories will immediately be discredited, because we couldn’t, ahem, awaken the bacon, if you will, as well as our friend. The last thing you want to find out is that your friend nailed him three times in one night, and when he was with you he spent half the night in the bathroom with Palmala Handerson and her five little sisters.</p>\n<p>But then there’s always that one person in the giant semen pool who somehow missed the mark. No, not as in they’re walking around sporting a jizz-headband, I mean they never got there in the first place. They’re too busy gettin’ low on the dance floor with that rando with snake bites and claiming they “don’t want to ruin any friendships” when really they just don’t want any of their friends to know that they have their initials tattooed on their dick. It happens. Look it up.</p>\n<p>For some people, incest is best. Like, for example, the triathlon team. Who are they fucking? I pass them every Friday morning when I’m doing my ultra-stealth walk of shame at five o’clock, and they are going to practice. That is not real life. What kind of hours do you operate on?

I’m not even talking about the relationship bullshit (well, not yet anyway). Now that the girls of I.V. are finally off the gluten/dairy/sugar-free crash diet, we can all stop being raging bitches.

Whew.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re in a relationship, single or in a “we’re just hooking up” scenario, Valentine’s Day is full of stereotypes. And it tends to more openly affect women. It just does. Let’s start with the singles.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, all mah single ladies are not hoppin’ around with one hand on their hip and the other doing a Miss America wave in the air too quickly.

They are not out at Sweet Alley gorging themselves on bin candy (Lies, I already blew our cover there; sorry). But no, mostly they are walking around promoting the fact that Valentine’s Day is “a stupid Hallmark holiday,” and let’s face it, singles are way too hipster for that shit. It’s a very Ryan Gosling-esque way of thinking (wait, he has a girlfriend?! SHIT!).</p>\n<p>But during that pivotal moment when people start thinking, “Whatever, let’s just throw a fuckin’ party; it IS a holiday after all,” the singles inevitably end up scrolling through their phonebooks. Even if guys don’t care about Valentine’s Day, no one really wants to be alone for it.</p>\n<p>I mean, yes, singles are alone, and it’s no different than any other day, really. Well, minus the goddamn flower/balloon/chocolate mash-up on the kitchen table your roommate waltzed in with that looks like an episode of “The Bachelor” threw up its rose ceremony everywhere. (By the way, Courtney sucks.) But do we have to be reminded, especially when the people in a relationship get to the point (usually after a sugar high or wine binge) where they try to empathize with their single friends? Totally unprovoked, they’ll throw out, “Yeah, it’s a stupid holiday, because when you’re in love shouldn’t every day be Valentine’s Day?” That’s cute when you’re in a relationship, but when you’re not, all of the bitter singles will politely ask you to please go suck a fuck.</p>\n<p>Really, though, couples don’t go particularly ape-shit over this holiday either. With Valentine’s Day, no matter what you do, it’s hard to win. You do nothing: fail. You do something, but it’s not over-the-top enough: fail. Or you do something that’s over the top and it’s “too much.” Fail. It’s too much pressure. It’s like an unexpected extra birthday party you don’t particularly feel like dropping your entire fucking day and planning for. And in the middle of the week? In the middle of the QUARTER?! Get real. I have a 246-page reader to finish before my midterm tomorrow. Love you tons, smoochietoons, but I’m knee deep in Robinson Crusoe, xoxo! “Gossip Girl.” Sorry, had to.</p>\n<p>My real fave, though, is the vanishing act. This typically happens with a fuck buddy that’s been around for a significant amount of time. This is when one person in the relationship just completely avoids the day altogether. If you got the text today that read: “Hey! What’s up, sorry I was super busy yesterday. How was your day?” please let him or her know that they are not fooling anyone. Sly move, but if you even did SOMETHING you would’ve gotten an after-school lay. Is there anything better than that? Well yeah, sure, probably, but a between classes, between the sheets session is pretty tough to beat.</p>\n<p>Ooh, here’s a fun little side note. As much as girls deny that it’s prostitution when we’re screwing you because you spent 12 bucks on a teddy bear, we’re fully aware of the situation, and if you’re lucky, we will thank you as we see fit. Not necessarily the bigger the bear, the bigger the bone. But, the thought does count.</p>\n<p>Personally? I dig Valentine’s Day, because I can drink a cosmo without having to feel like I’m being too high-maintenance. I even bought myself three pairs of shoes and actually got away with it this week. I didn’t go as far as sending myself flowers (God no! I’m not that pathetic), but the edible fruit arrangement really did provide just the right touch.</p>\n<p>See, Valentine’s Day doesn’t suck that bad. I’d probably stop complaining about it altogether if we got school off for a full day slay-athon. Sigh. Wishful thinking. Welp, there’s always Presidents’ Day to look forward to! ;)</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is lying: she never needs an excuse to drink a cosmo.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/","id":6418,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6417,6416,6415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“I’m Rooting for Peyton Manning”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Watching the Super Bowl for girls is like watching the WNBA … for anyone.

Read a book about the Manning family, my friend. Read. A. Book.</p>\n<p>The girls are only in it for the halftime show, really. And to take a keg stand or two (don’t try to be a hero), so that we can casually stick around for three hours after the game ends. Hey, that keg won’t finish itself. Of course, when the halftime show actually comes, every guy immediately bolts out the door (brbsnappa!) … which allows the girls to finally have their moment and eat a Buffalo wing in peace without having to worry about looking like a primitive savage. And let’s be honest, all this show did was remind me how much Madonna sucks. Then throw in the wild card of Cee Lo coming out wearing a jazzed-up rain tarp … just why? I would have gladly jumped up there and lip-synced to “Vogue.” Too bad Madonna’s 53 and somehow manages to look younger than me. Luckily, the real halftime show coincided with the kitty halftime show of the Puppy Bowl, which was far more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The one and only time I perked up was when they actually did cut to Gisele in the audience. Because let’s be real, if I wanted to watch a bunch of fat men running around in tights, I’d just go to an American Apparel in Houston. But of course I had to do my duty and cheer on Tom Brady, because the chances of me being able to name any other guy out on that field are about as close to the chances of me giving up alcohol for Lent. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>\n<p>Speaking of alcohol, the Super Bowl turns classy ladies into self-proclaimed frat stars. Keg stands? Gargoyles? Shotgunning? Bring it. By the end of the first half I’m pretty sure I was opening bottles with my forearm. God no, that was a boldfaced lie. Could you imagine? But thanks to midday mass alcoholic consumption, it was kind of difficult to get on board with looking sexy when the Super Bowl ended. “No, no, my eyes always look like this, I’m not even that drunk. Not even that drunk.”</p>\n<p>The one good thing about the Super Bowl is that everyone can bond over the commercials. Except for when Adriana Lima came on for the Victoria’s Secret Valentine’s Day commercial and every guy in the room had to maneuver their seating arrangement to conceal a half-master. Same result anywhere you go after that commercial comes on. The girls in the room start debating whether or not her boobs are real, and the guys are sitting there in awe, shaking their heads, saying, “Doesn’t matter. Does not matter.”</p>\n<p>Well, to be real, the Super Bowl wasn’t all that bad. The last 10 minutes were intense. I’m talking in tents. It almost made me want to learn the rules of the game. When the Giants finally sealed their win, it all of a sudden was déjà vu back to New Year’s. Screaming, yelling, bottles opening. It was out of control. Giants couples everywhere were most likely making out euphorically, and Patriot pair-ups were consoling each other with love. The Super Bowl can really bring people together, and look at that, just in time for V-Day. Regardless of if your team won, or however much money you painfully lost, there was still plenty of room to come out of the day with a W. Well, maybe not entirely … now, I need to go donate all of my New England Patriots 2012 Champions gear to the nearest Goodwill …</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks doesn’t mean to generalize. Not all girls hate watching the Super Bowl. However, all of them would prefer to be doing The Titanic.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Ana Murray” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"423182063\" data-slb-group=\"44415\"><img data-attachment-id=\"44416\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/am-superbowlhump-2-8-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=2552%2C2001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2552,2001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=888%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-44416\" title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12-250x196.jpg?resize=250%2C196\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/","id":6415,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6414,6413,6412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“I’m Not a Slut, I Swear” and Other Bedroom Mantras","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Shit Girls Say” started an epidemic.

I just watched “Shit People Say About Shit People Say Videos” for a solid minute and 39 seconds; yeah, it’s gotten to that point. But you know what they don’t have? A “Shit Guys and Girls Say During or After Hookups That Just Really, Really Should Not Be Happening.” These are a few that need to stop:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1. The Unprovoked “What?”: God, classic. You’re sprawled out in bed, it’s 7 a.m. and the I.V. construction workers can blatantly see you in the buff through the window. He checks his watch, because, yes, he kept it on throughout the sex. The girl is awake first, as she always is, and just pretending to be asleep (fact). And then, shoot, you’re both awake and you both know it and no one’s talking … so, out of nowhere, the girl looks over and says “Whaaaat?” and the guy all of a sudden remembers why he doesn’t ever want a girlfriend, ever, and responds with, “Nothing.” Nothing, bitch. Nothing. You need to chill out. Nothing. The “what” is a recurring issue. Just stop asking, because, really, has it ever worked? Never has he turned and said, “Actually, you know, I have just been waiting for someone to ask me that. This is what is going on in my hea- Wait! Actually, can I just like have your number to chat? Just to cuddle for half an hour and then walk you home while concealing my boner?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2. The Dirty Talk That Haunts You: Sometimes when you’re in bed (read: every time) someone says something that seems so perfectly fitting, but actually isn’t. And then you’re sitting in your 8 a.m. three days later and all of a sudden it creeps back into your head. You’re taking a test, trying to remember the answer to number 3 and all you can hear is, “Swallow that pimp juice” in that bedroom whisper, and you want to crawl into a hole and die. Like, what the fuck is the answer to number 3? That’s all I wanted to know.</p>\n<p>3. The “I’m not a slut, I swear” Line: That awkward moment when both parties are completely naked and condom wrappers are coming off and all of a sudden it turns into a Dr. Phil session. There is no need to get into “what’s your number” talks, but for some reason girls seem to jump at the opportunity to save face before showing a guy their O-face. He probably didn’t think she was a slut when he brought her home, and even if he did, it clearly has not fazed him at all. But now the horrible buzz-kill moment of having to stop to put on a condom has turned into a 35-second segue into, “So listen, these are my morals.” Don’t worry about it. Either stop counting or stop sleeping around. Or call your sluttier friends — they always make you feel better. And even if you run out of fingers … or toes … numbers will always stretch to infinity.</p>\n<p>4. The “No, no, you’re fine, let me push your head down farther” Move: Do you ever eat bananas? And by eat, I mean swallow them entirely whole. If you do, then congratulations! You don’t have a gag reflex! But for those of us that do, it’s really, really not a good time, when you’re coming up for air, for the guy to push your head down farther because you’re “almost there.” (Note: Your definition of “almost” is not the same as ours.) And then there’s the most horrifying moment of all: the run to the bathroom (fingers crossed you even make it) and proj-vom. No one wants that. Just lean back, yo. Lace your fingers behind your head, and we’ll take care of the one downstairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We all do it. We’re all guilty, and it’s fine. At least we’re not bored enough to make a video about it, or maybe we’re just too embarrassed. Probably both. Peace, love … pimp juice? Yup, yeah, right there with you. I wish I didn’t say it again, too.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is not a slut, she swears.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"848718004\" data-slb-group=\"44138\"><img data-attachment-id=\"44139\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/no-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=1662%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1662,604\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=250%2C91&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=888%2C323&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-44139\" title=\"NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12-250x90.jpg?resize=250%2C90\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"90\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44138\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44138\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/","id":6425,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6424,6423,6422],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":8,"route":"/categories/opinion/wednesday-hump","highestPage":11}},"__N_SSG":true}
