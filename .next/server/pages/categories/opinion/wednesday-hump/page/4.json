Then, your group’s favorite song comes on, and just as T-Swift is going on about how “miserable and magical” you’re feeling (in the best way of course), you turn to your best friend and realize how hot she looks in that crop top and short shorts.  You’re singing, you’re grinding and out of nowhere you’re making out … What happens next is history — well, her-story really — because you let curiosity get the best of you and quite literally let the cat out of its tight, zippered bag.</p>\n<p>Let’s be honest (or should I say lesbihonest?): Sometimes, you just want to experiment outside of your sexual norms. As a gay man, there are plenty of times I like to hook up with girls just for fun, and while most of these experiences are purely erotic, devoid of any romance whatsoever, they still happen and I enjoy every second of them. With that said, I’m not the type to cuddle a girl. To be honest, I don’t even hold hands with girls and not because I don’t like them or don’t think that they’re pretty, but really because I reserve romance for men — probably because I’m gay. Still, I like to venture out and try new things, and, to be totally honest with you, I’d call you a liar if you told me that you never at least thought about doing the same.</p>\n<p>The really interesting thing about experimenting with other genders is that many of us have thought about the idea of doing it, but never really the act of doing it. What I’ve found in that past is that our brains separate eroticism and intimacy pretty well … because, let’s be real, it’s not like you want to date last Saturday’s dime piece or even your fuckbuddy. Sexual chemistry and romantic chemistry are two pretty different, albeit intertwined, concepts. I sleep with a lot of different guys, for instance, but I don’t have romantic interest in most of them, and the same goes for when I’m experimenting with girls. With that said, the first step in turning your experimental thoughts into sexual actions is to stop and realize that your sexual attraction to someone and your romantic attraction to someone are totally different from each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Once you’ve started to realize that intimacy and sex are totally separate concepts, you need to ask yourself: Do I want to do this?  Experimentation isn’t for everyone, and I’m not going to be the first to tell you that if you’re not comfortable breaking through your sexual boundaries just yet, you don’t have to. Still, it can be really fun to start slow, and most girls will agree that tipsy makeout sessions with your best friends can actually be really fun. And men, don’t be afraid to break social norms either, because, I’m sorry, but grabbing No. 49’s ass after the football game isn’t really that far from kissing; rather, it’s just one of many socially acceptable forms of male-on-male eroticism.</p>\n<p>With that said, I’m also here to tell you that finding members of “the other gender” (the one you don’t normally find sexually appealing) attractive doesn’t have to dictate your sexuality as a whole. I think it’s funny when straight guys ask me, “Well, how do you know if you’re gay if you haven’t tried girls yet?” Why? Because I have slept with girls and guess what, the V just doesn’t really appeal to me like the D. So on the flip-side, why have I slept with girls if I know that I’m gay? Because it’s fun. Like, really fun … it’s totally a spur-of-the-moment type thing that happens just as randomly as group sex or BDSM, and doesn’t make me straight or bi or pan or anything for that matter. Only you can define your sexuality — nobody else. And to all you straight folk out there, I’m here to tell you that flipping to the other side for a night won’t make you gay. If it did, let’s be real, I’d have a lot more gay friends than I do right now.</p>\n<p>Going back to that mention of group sex though, it’s actually a great way to initiate experimentation for those of you who are afraid to try it one-on-one. The first time I ever slept with a girl was during a threesome with another guy and, technically, that was a form of experimentation whether he wants to admit it or not — but trust me, he admits it. With that said, go ahead and ask your girlfriend for the kind of threesome she’s always dreamed of having, because guess what? Group sex not only offers you a more acceptable form of experimentation, but further, it might open you up to attractions and urges you never felt compelled or secure enough to explore in the past.</p>\n<p>All in all, experimentation can be a really fun way to spice up your sex life and explore your own interests. While lots of people are afraid of the idea of experimentation, realize that almost everyone I know has had some sort of “out-of-the norm” sexual fantasy that they couldn’t really explain, and that it’s okay for you to have them, too. In essence, sexuality isn’t black and white at all. In fact, it’s a rainbow of colors that blur together and coexist in absolute awesomeness that knows no boundaries and has no limits. In closing, let me leave you with a fun little motto I’ve recently decided to live by: Fuck the rules, because fucking rules.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

It’s no surprise that rebound sex happens frequently — studies show that about one-third of college students will engage in rebound sex within a month of their breakup. Those numbers are probably even higher on a campus like ours. And, in some cases, rebound sex can be harmless. You wham, you bam, you thank your ma’am and it’s all out of your system. Look at you, getting on with your life.</p>\n<p>But is it really beneficial? Does it help ease the pain of a lost love? Unfortunately, there are no valid studies out there to show whether or not rebound sex helps anybody. All we can go on is personal experience.  And, of course, to each their own. Some people might swear by rebound sex, and others might condemn it.<br>\nI condemn it. And not because I think casual sex is wrong. If that’s your thing, you do you. I simply feel the disadvantages of engaging in rebound sex will drastically outweigh the advantages.</p>\n<p>Rebound sex is, well, awkward. I don’t understand the appeal of having a drunken night of trying to figure out how to please a complete stranger. You just came out of a long-term relationship, where your partner knew exactly how to please you and you knew exactly how to please them. Now you’re like, “Is this guy into biting? My ex was into biting.” And that guy is like, “This chick really needs to stop biting me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And then there’s the awkward post-sex moment of thinking how unsatisfying that experience was. And then — of course — you start missing your ex. And instead of feeling empowered by going out and sleeping with someone else, you end up feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>Why is this a good idea again?</p>\n<p>Not only does the whole experience seem blatantly un-enjoyable, but it can even be detrimental. Being close and intimate with someone won’t necessarily distract you from your ex. In fact, it could just end up reminding you of your ex, because you were intimate with your ex for such a long time. You’ll compare these kisses to your ex’s kisses. You’ll compare this body to your ex’s body. How could you not?</p>\n<p>And, generally, if you still have feelings for your ex, then your ex is going to win this mini competition in your head. Instead of thinking that this new sex partner is great, you’ll be lying in bed wondering if anyone will ever have abs that are as great as your ex’s were. So, instead of distracting yourself (which was your game plan in the beginning) you are inadvertently making your head explode with thoughts about how great your past love was.</p>\n<p>Motivations for rebound sex are also generally not thought through very well. Are you seeking rebound sex for revenge? Why exactly should your ex care if you sleep with someone new? If they dumped you, they probably anticipated you would have sex with someone else eventually. And anyway, it will be obvious to your ex that this “great sex” you had was actually nothing but a dig at them. It’s not an indication that you’ve moved on, it’s an indication that you are not handling the breakup well.</p>\n<p>And if you’re trying to make your ex jealous, having rebound sex isn’t the way to do either. That will most likely just make your ex angry with you or end up hurting them, and that will not make them want you back — trust me. Hearing that my ex has turned into a man-slut will not make me desire him more. And if they aren’t angry or hurt, then they’ve probably moved on and your sexcapades are pointless.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not saying that if you’ve had rebound sex that you’re an idiot. On the contrary, very intelligent and rational people do it all the time and maybe it actually does help some. The broken-hearted will search out all avenues. I’m just pointing out the bad side and some of it’s flawed logic. If you’re just sleeping with someone to get back at an ex, it will probably not make you feel much better. And if you’re doing it to forget an ex, then that probably won’t work out too well either. I think people should be warned.</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing all your energy on having meaningless sex with someone random, maybe you should focus your energy on a new hobby or building a new friendship. Surround yourself with good people, keep distracted with projects you enjoy and try to be happy alone. Eventually, the urge to rebound will fade, and you’ll find that sexy someone who you want to start a new relationship with. And, best of all, they will be able to give you a much more enjoyable and less awkward sexual experience.</p>\n<p><em>Brenna Dilger says getting it up quickly is not always best.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

In my opinion, the best thing about Halloween is that we get to dress up as whatever the fuck we want, pretend to be someone else for a night and not get judged for it. I’m going to be a French maid this Friday, and I’m planning on using my costume as an opportunity to seduce the guys while I’m out. Come up with some fun, flirty lines that go with your costume and lure in potential partners.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While playing your character at parties is fun, role playing during sex is even better.  With that said, use your costume to your advantage and bring it to the bedroom with you. Gonna be a nurse? Play doctor with the hottie you find and give him a checkup that’s extra thorough. Going out as a cop? Place someone under your arrest (extra points for actually using the handcuffs that come with your costume).</p>\n<p>Make sure that the person behind the mask is actually what you’re looking for.  Last year, one of my friends took home a guy dressed as a zombie. His body was nice, but he was wearing a mask the majority of the night, and she didn’t end up seeing his face until she was too drunk to care. Next morning, she was horrified to find that he had eaten her out with a fat cold sore on his lips — gross! For the sake of your dignity — and not catching the herp — make sure you get a good look at the person you’re flirting with before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>Find your Halloween counterpart. One really fun thing my friends and I try to do on Halloween is find the counterparts to the costumes that we’re wearing. Last year I was a playboy bunny, so I tried to find myself a gay Hugh Hefner to sleep with … while I was unsuccessful, the “straight” Hugh I ended up flipping was really great in bed.  Who doesn’t like a challenge, right?</p>\n<p>Think outside the box.  While it’s I guess it’s okay to be a “slutty cop,” “slutty cat” or “slutty whatever-the-fuck,” it’s even more fun to wear something creative that grabs everyone’s attention. Doing this will make you stand out, and besides, that “slutty mouse” outfit you’re planning on wearing is more basic than the Pumpkin Spice Latte I’m drinking right now. My sophomore year, I went out as Twitter. Rocking blue tights, a blue feather hat, no shirt and a whiteboard around my neck, people wrote tweets on me all night. One such tweet, “I want to eat @matttogni’s ass #ButtReally #PunIntended,” actually got me laid.  Hooray for cheesy hashtags, am I right?</p>\n<p>BDSM. While this could totally go under the “roleplaying” tip, I like BDSM so much that I decided to give it its own section — because seriously, what’s hotter than being tied up in a chair while someone tells you to beg them for sex. I think that this one’s pretty self-explanatory, so have fun playing your best horror movie fantasies and get crazy. On Saturday when I go out as a cop, expect that I’ll use my baton in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>Safety. Wanna know the scariest part of Halloween? The fact that many of us are going to get laid, and that 1 in 4 sexually active college students have an STD (source: Centers for Disease Control). With that said, I know that most of us are  going to be wearing next to nothing this weekend, but use your bras or underwear to stash a condom or two to ensure that you can be safe when doing the dirty … because who wants to be a part of that statistic? Not me. Ew.</p>\n<p>Consent. I know I talk about this in literally every article that I write, but it’s really important to make sure that both you and your partner give consent before you have sex. Only yes means yes. End of story.</p>\n<p>Despite the out-of-towners, countless cops and lack of parking that Halloween is bound to entail, there’s a reason why it’s famous here in Isla Vista … it’s a fucking blast! In all honesty, the biggest tip I can give y’alls is to simply let loose and have fun. Don’t be a buzzkill this weekend, dress up, because I’m sorry, but I don’t wanna be the only half-naked French maid out there on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween, happy Halloweekend, and happy humping, folks!</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni has no problem admitting that he’s a little bit of a basic bitch.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

The truth is, some pretty bizarre shit goes down during sex.</p>\n<p>Inspired by some of my own “awksauce” moments as well as the stories of my fellow female friends, this one’s for all my ladies out there who have personally experienced the cringe-, sigh-, laugh- and barf-worthy moments during times of titillation.

Farted. May or may not have been you.<br>\nYou’re the one who ate the jalapeno bean burrito during lunch. The sex, however, is a little too loud and rowdy for you to truly pinpoint the stink criminal, so instead, just let it go and try to cover up the smell with some major hip gyrating and louder moaning.</p>\n<p>2. Queefed. This one was definitely you.<br>\nNo escape here. It’s not like he has the squelching vagina.</p>\n<p>3. Forgot to shave.<br>\nThere’s nothing like a nice pair of prickly legs, spidery underarms and a spiky nether region to keep your partner aroused.</p>\n<p>4. Hair tie or die.<br>\nHe’s already sweating enough to cure California’s drought, and you’re only adding to the sweat pool. So here you are, wishing you brought a damn hair tie. Sure, post-sex bedhead is cute, but you can’t seem to remember why as your hair plasters to your neck like an itchy sticker.</p>\n<p>5. Salty boobs.<br>\nI’ve always been confounded about how I should respond when my boyfriend, upon affectionately licking my nipples after (or during) sex, exclaims: “Salty.” Thanks, I was sweating?</p>\n<p>6. Facial gone wrong.<br>\nEver had a badly aimed facial where cum landed directly in your eye? Bad, I tell you. Bad. My eye stayed irritated for a good couple of hours.</p>\n<p>7. Forgot you had a tampon in.<br>\nIt took some epic debating to finally decide that yes, sex during a period is fine … until you suddenly remember as he presses his tip against you that your tampon is still inside.</p>\n<p>8. Dried menstrual blood…<br>\n…is pretty darn scary in the a.m. It seemed like a harmless idea to do it in the blood the night before, but waking up to crusty redness all up in between your legs, on his penis, on your face and over his hands isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing morning view.</p>\n<p>9. Me no speak dirty?<br>\nBlanking out on dirty talk triggers feelings of moderate inadequacy and high awkwardness. In a desperate attempt to continue the sexual momentum, you splutter out phrases like “oh you bad boy” and “you like that?” and “fuck me” (in altering variations). The only problem is that the more you talk, the more you realize that you’re saying the same lines over and over again. If you feel the need to increase your vulgar vocabulary, I suggest visiting thesaurus.com or reading more erotic literature. “Talk dirty to me?” I’m trying, Jason Derulo. I’m trying.</p>\n<p>10. Weird cramp.<br>\nIt’s the sudden, painful contraction of the muscles in your calf, your buttock, the arch of your foot … What’s saddening is how quickly a cramp drains away your mood and sends you straight back to stage zero arousal.</p>\n<p>11. Boobs squeezed way too hard.<br>\nThese are orbs of flesh that you should respect and massage, not stress balls that you squeeze the living daylights out of.</p>\n<p>12. Butt slapped way too severely.<br>\nQuick stings feel hot and sexy, but these whams feel borderline sadistic. The uncomfortable part about this check item is how to tell your partner that his butt-slapping action turns you off more than on. The even more uncomfortable part is when he takes out some rope and replies, “Wait, I thought you were into BDSM?”</p>\n<p>13. Weird stains.<br>\nOn the underwear, on the bed sheets … Who knows what actually happened?</p>\n<p>14. Photo of parents stare back at you.<br>\nMaking love to a man who loves his ‘rents? That’s cute, but not during the moment you look over his shoulder and notice in horror that the family photo watches you ever so closely.</p>\n<p>15. Bfarting (belly farts).<br>\n[Noun of my own creation] Pronounced &lt;buh\\fart\\eeng&gt; (the ‘b’ is not silent.)<br>\n[Meaning] A bizarre sound produced when two sweaty bellies suction together. The noise is fart-equivalent.</p>\n<p>16. He ejaculates inside. The awkward cleanup process.<br>\nTo the women who have a handy trick on how to deal with the semen deposited inside of them, please share your wisdom. For the rest of us, it’s a “1-2-3 GO, GO, GO” military drill where he flings you a tissue, you stuff it under your weeping vagina and you proceed to make the awkward duck waddle to the toilet.</p>\n<p>17. Bad BO? GTFO.<br>\nCan’t hide it, can’t deny it. Might be worse than fart stench.</p>\n<p><em>R.Pengsta embraces the awkward and you should, too!</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Very close quarters.<br>\nTake it from your seasoned humper here — great fun looms in the fornicating future of your dorm room days, but I’m sure more than one of you will have a few hurdles to leap over along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m stuck in a triple. Halp.</strong><br>\nI know it seems like a disadvantage. The more roommates, the more people you have to surreptitiously kick out for your sexy time satisfaction. I’m here to assure you, however, that just because you’re cemented to the tripling scene doesn’t mean you’ll be sex-deprived.<br>\nUsually, a triple plays out in a few common scenarios. The first is that your roommates are laid back, tolerant or never home. Hence, your partner will journey his or her way down a few rooms (or an entire residence hall, if you’re into inter-hall intercourse) to your magical lair, and the deed will be done, easy-peasy. The second is the reverse situation where your partner has the tolerant roommates or, better yet, lives in a double or single. Don’t complicate your newly blossoming roommate relationship when the buddy you’re bangin’ has a perfectly wonderful rooming situation to make use of. As for the third scenario? Well, let’s just say that the more the merrier, and if y’all are down, might as well get down.<br>\nThere is, of course, the possibility of doing the nasty while your ‘mates (the living kind) are still in the room, whether snoozing along their REM cycle or distracted by a movie on their laptop. I advise you to tread carefully here because this one’s a bit sticky. Some might enjoy the idea of exhibitionism — even if the voyeur never meant to be one at all — and will find the notion of sex with others in the room an exciting, dark and dangerous thrill. However, many others will deem this act disrespectful and highly awkward. After being on both sides of the spectrum, I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry. Communicate with your roommates and don’t fuck with the rule of respect. Everyone shares a space, so honor that.</p>\n<p><strong>The dreadful sin called sexiling.</strong><br>\nBelieve me, it can be dreadful. Since we’re already on the topic of honoring the space of others, let’s talk sexiling. For those unfamiliar with this godforsaken term, sexiling refers to the typically unceremonious “exiling” of your roommate(s) from the room during your act of libidinous lovemaking. To give you an example, when my boyfriend was sexiled during his freshman year, he was forced to take his bedsheets outside and sleep in the hallway. Was he allowed to sleep there? No. Was he acting more spitefully than was proper? Maybe. But that’s what sexiling does to people. It makes them into bitter gremlins. Bitter, bitter gremlins.<br>\nTo avoid bitter gremlinhood, I suggest you have a clean, calm conversation with your roommates about your copulating needs. There’s no denying sex, and there’s no denying that as first-years (or any years) stuck in the cage called a shared dorm room, it will be very difficult to copulate freely. Don’t lose hope, however. Humans are flexible, adaptable beings. Talk it through, set up a system and buy them extra ramen. It’ll be all right, you’ll see.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Lofted bed is lofty.</strong><br>\nAfter the initial wave of novelty in a lofted bed dies down, the unfortunate reality of your bunked mattress is that sex up there isn’t the most convenient. Didn’t screw your bolts in right? You’ll be clanking and rocking your very own earthquake for the victims living below you. Put the bed up too high? Have fun bonking your brains out on the ceiling when you sit up to stretch. Need a paper towel to clean up? Or did you just realize that you need to pee right here, right now and right away? Sorry brah, take the ladder down your misery cot first.<br>\nTo be honest, besides delofting (literally and figuratively), there’s no real solution to your elevated bed, especially if you’re in a triple and can’t afford to lower it. The best thing to do in this case is to be prepared. Have some paper towels or tissues ready for a last-minute cleanup. Wedge your condoms between the mattress and bed frame instead of deep inside your drawer that you need to climb down for. Make sure your bed is secured and sturdily lofted before you buck-and-bang. I feel you on your troubles, but you might find your circumstance educational, if anything. After all, like our good pal Albert Einstein once said, “The only source of knowledge is experience.”</p>\n<p><strong>Turn down the volume, will you?</strong><br>\nIt’s Sunday, post-brunch. After a filling meal from DLG or Portola, you sink into your desk chair with your anthropology book or some math assignments that you’ve long procrastinated on. It’s all smooth going at first. Easy reading, easy scribbling of your pencil on the paper … and then shit doesn’t just hit, but ruthlessly demolishes the fan. Those low, lusty moans turn into powerful grunts and groans, thundering yelps and yips and ear-splitting shouts and screams. Forget homework — let me cleanse my ears first.<br>\nThere’s nothing wrong with loud sex … when you’re not disrespecting others during the course of it. Of course, it’s difficult to maintain self-restraint, especially when you’re reaching the point of no return, but the inevitable reality is that halls and halls of your peers are stationed right above, next to or below you.<br>\nUsually the people who have constant, loud sex are proud of their noise, embarrassed by it or unaware of its actual volume. Screamers, just close those damn windows. I know it gets hot in there, so consider investing in a fan and taking a nice, relaxing shower afterward. As for the fed-up listeners, pluck up some courage and overcome your passive aggressiveness by tactfully — yes, tactfully — confronting the loud lovers. More often that not, however, the sad truth is that the noise will not go away. The libido is insatiable, so the best way you can work around the situation is move away from the ruckus. Change up your environment and work in the lounge, UCen or Davidson Library. These spaces were made to accommodate you, so be sure to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>While the issues of dormitory sex life are abundant indeed, fear not. Humps always prevail. Feel free to shoot me a message about any of the issues mentioned above, or, better yet, send over a juicy story about your current or previous res hall raunchiness. I’m all ears.<br>\n<em>R.

Offering access to your glory parts with the foolish belief that strings will never attach is cause for skepticism. In an effort to lend some of you incoming Gauchos a hook-up hand, here are five signs that the casual copulation of your impending college career isn’t as casual as it seems.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Skyrim, Quentin Tarantino and dinner dates</strong><br>\nIf you and your noncommittal playmate begin to commit to suspicious acts of dating and loads of quality time together, you’ve reached a big no-no. Reevaluate the purpose of the relationship and speak up about it. Tell your sexual buddy-o the truth. “I’m only interested in the game because I’m interested in you.” “Excuse me, Fridays were never our night to watch Django Unchained.” “There’s no reason why I would ever think of taking you to dinner for an anniversary.” What anniversary? You aren’t together.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The curse of the green monster</strong><br>\nJealousy is a subtle and nasty little indication that what’s being said and what’s being felt aren’t matching up with each other. Look out for this annoying sucker in both yourself and your partner. Casual goes personal when green gets into the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Much cuddle, such wow</strong><br>\nThis one’s a classic. Cuddling for a little bit after a casual buckin’ n’ bangin’ is fine, but if you’re doing it all night and all morning, I’m telling you. Something’s up. Love, affection and post-sex snuggling feel amazing, but those should come from the boyfriend or girlfriend, not the hook-up. Even if you’re absolutely sure that cuddling has no intimate impact on you, it might not be the same for your pillow-sharing spooner.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PDA and pet names</strong><br>\nGood grief, no. If traits of your sexy-time start trickling public with handholding, kissing and adorable name-calling, you’re hitting the danger zone. External (and internal) expectations of the relationship as well as your reputation will be affected, not to mention how awkward your friends will feel.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Trust the science</strong><br>\nSome of you might already know that sex triggers the release of dopamine (our natural happy drug) in the brain. However, did you also know that orgasms trigger release of oxytocin and vasopressin, which in turn can trigger feelings of attachment? Research revealed by Rutger University’s anthropology professor Helen Fischer indicates that 50 percent of people who hook up do it to start a relationship — and one-third of these people actually succeed. The innate nature of sex, as told by clues of chemistry and evolutionary implications, can be tied down to deeper, more complex emotions of connection. It’s inevitable.</p>\n<p>I’m not telling you to avoid casual sex and have that dream wither up, nun-status. One, that isn’t my right, and two, that just isn’t right. On the contrary, my words to you are a friendly reminder that when you embrace your college sexcapading, make sure you communicate with your sex buddy about both of your underlying motivations. If you catch yourself always experiencing the aforementioned signs, you probably need to reevaluate the reasons behind your so-called “casual.” There’s nothing wrong with sex under the pretense of romance, but if you and your partner don’t own up to this and instead pretend it’s all about the big “O,” one or both of you could get hurt. It’s best to be real about your desires and the core reason behind why you’re doing what you’re doing. It will give you power to make the right calls and the right decisions.</p>\n<p>So, all in all: Respect the cat, and respect honest sex. Once the alarms start blaring, either get ready to romance, or get yo’ ass outta there.</p>\n<p><em>R.

What do I do? </em><br>\nYou are certainly not alone in this conundrum; this is a tale as old as Sam hirself. The thing you really need to ponder is whether or not she is someone you want to have a future with. If her company for nine months of the year is worth the sacrifice of loneliness for the rest, then stay with her. If you think you’re going to want to meet up with your random ex from high school who went away and got really hot, then go ahead and say adiós to the lady here. It really comes down to a question of intent: Are you in it for the sex or the company? If you answer sex, break it off. Company, try to keep it up.</p>\n<p><em>My boyfriend will not stop staring me directly in the eyes while we have sex. I think he thinks it’s romantic, but it’s really just creeping me out. How can I get him to stop without hurting his feelings?</em><br>\nPepper spray him directly in the corneas, he won’t stare at anything for weeks. Sam hopes that you know that is a joke because that’s three to five years in jail, otherwise … most definitely assault. Really, you can try closing your eyes out of “sheer ecstasy” instead of looking back at him. Or you could suggest that you turn all the lights off so he can stare away at the black abyss while you’re none the wiser. Yet another option, hug him close so he couldn’t look at you even if he wanted to. Otherwise, try to think about why that makes you so uncomfortable to 1) be stared at 2) to confront him about it. If you have trouble being intimate with him, maybe it’s time to get up and roll out. </p>\n<p><em>I think my girlfriend read some story about how guys like to have a finger put up their butts when they’re getting head … First of all, wrong. Second of all, she’s really self-conscious so is there some clever way I can get her to stop trying to do that? </em><br>\nClench your cheeks! That will make it very difficult for her to place anything up there against your will. Either that or you can take the logical approach and tell her that the finger method does not work for you. If you really don’t want to talk to her and her fingers are determined to break your clench, you can always try to sit down when she wants to go down on you, thus blocking your butthole entirely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>So this girl I’ve been hooking up with has a giant Ryan Gosling poster hanging over her bed and every time we go at it I feel him looking directly into my soul and judging my less-than-perfect hair. I’m almost certain she would pick the poster over me, so I can’t ask her to take it down. Do you know of any sex moves that might endanger said poster?</em><br>\nThe “Freddie Mercury” is a classically dangerous sex position for any and all posters, Ryan Gosling ones included. This position necessitates that the giver be backed up against the wall in a celebratory single “fist pump” position, while the receiver bends over in front, either bent over to the floor or grabbing a chair of some sort. This will give you the perfect time to secretly reach back with your fist-pumping hand and rip off Gosling’s beautifully judgmental face. Chances are she will be extremely sad, thus ruining the moment, but your mission will be complete. Bear in mind, however, that there are approximately one billion posters / pictures of Ryan Gosling that can be hung upon walls of all sorts. Your victory will be short-lived, my friend. Short-lived, indeed.</p>\n<p><em>I wanna liven things up in the bedroom. What’s the best toy I can get for a reasonable price? </em><br>\nFor a college student tryna ball on a budget, Sam recommends a vibrating cock ring. They’re cheap (although, go too cheap and the battery might die on you mid-hump) and it will add a bang to both of your … bangs. If you’re really, really on a budget, pull a <em>50 Shades</em> and head to Home Depot … you’ll be surprised by how much spicier things will get when a piece of rope is involved.</p>\n<p><em>Everyone keeps telling me I can’t graduate without having sex on the beach, but that sounds miserable! And the alternative, the library, sounds just as bad. Am I being a wuss or is everyone else just hyping this up because it sounds exciting?</em><br>\nFirst of all, it is a known fact that the UCSB deans will simply refuse to give you your diploma if you haven’t had sex in one of these two places. Trust me, it’s in the UCSB handbook. But checking this off your bucket list shouldn’t feel like a chore; both the beach and the library can be bliss. The key to sex on the beach is simply to bring a towel; sans towel, you’ll get cold sand and tar in places where you ain’t never had tar before. Then again, the best way to take off tar is baby oil … which could make for a kinky round two when you get back to your place. For the library, since we don’t have a classic shady “stacks,” time is going to be your biggest enemy. It all hinges on you wearing quickie-specific clothing; unfortunately, guys on guys are going to have the hardest time with this, but it’s possible. Of course, you could always cheat and use the listening rooms in the music library … still counts in Sam’s book. So make sure you hit the library before you slip on that cap and gown (which, by the way, serves as a perfect uniform for an easy-access, pre-ceremony quickie … you’re welcome). </p>\n<p><em>Last weekend I saw my first uncircumcised penis. It kind of freaked me out at first, so I was just wondering if this is like a common thing or if he was just an anomaly.</em><br>\nIn the ’70s, two-thirds of boys born in the U.S. were circumcised, but the rate has been steadily dropping since then, now hovering at around 57 percent. All I’m saying is that you’re more likely than not going to encounter more uncircumcised penises in the future, so calm down. Go with what your momma taught you and don’t judge a book by its cover. The only time when you’ll notice a difference is during a blowjob, but relax; just pull the foreskin back if you don’t want to deal with it, no big deal. Even better, use your hands to incorporate that hood.</p>\n<p><em>I really like this guy I’ve been dating, but he keeps tearing my neck up with hickeys every time we hook up and I can’t wear scarves in this heat! He says it turns him on, but I’m the one who has to deal with the consequences. How do I go about this? </em><br>\nYou could be a champ and just get your makeup game strong (guys can wear foundation too, yo), but Sam understands that this can get exhausting. Just use your words; compromise by telling him that you love when he kisses your neck, but softer kisses actually turn you on more. If he still won’t learn, just return the favor until he understands what it’s like to constantly look like an extra on the “Walking Dead.”<br>\n<em>Sam the Oracle stays clenched. Always.</em></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, May 21, 2014 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Something that people don’t do on purpose — or so I’d hope, anyways — is screw things up in the bedroom. Sometimes the sex you want isn’t always the sex you get. And while the number of stories I’ve heard from both girlfriends and guy friends about terrible sex is astounding, it also surprises me how often people have really shitty sex — no pun intended. As such, in this article, I’m going to share some of the funniest, scariest and most ratchet sexcapades I’ve ever heard.  They come from friends, roommates, acquaintances and personal experience, but ultimately, are being told not just for your entertainment, but also so you know what to do next time a bad fuck ensues. With that said, brace yourselves, because we’re about to talk about bad butt-fucks, vaginal mishaps, disturbing dome and all places you don’t want your partner to puncture.</p>\n<p>Minuteman<br>\n“It was long night of drinking in I.V. when I started to message this boy I’d met a couple days before on Grindr. I had been planning to hook up with him for a while at this point, waiting for the perfect moment, and this particular Saturday night felt right. I was really horny and honestly, just wanted some D in my A. I got to my house but alas, my roommate was home — a fact that simply wasn’t going to stop me that night. I’d been lusting after him for days, so I grabbed my car keys and decided that we would do it in my car. We jumped into the backseat, tore open the condom and broke out the Astroglide. No foreplay to warm me up; I assumed he was just saving up his juices for the impending anal. He slid in, slid out, slid in again and after what couldn’t have been more than four or five thrusts, says to me ‘I’m so sorry, I haven’t come in days.’ He had already finished, and I was left sorely unsatisfied. This was a boy I would never talk to again. Word of advice to all men out there: If you ever want to turn your hookup into a fuck buddy, jack off daily to ensure that both you and your partner get theirs. You can’t run out of cum, so use it, ooze it and abuse it.”</p>\n<p>Bloody Valentine<br>\n“So I’d been talking to my boyfriend for a couple months about trying anal since we’d been dating for almost two years. Finally, after a romantic Valentine’s Day and many bottles of red wine, we decided to give it a shot. With no lubricant or condoms, intense foreplay led us both to believe we could do the dirty — literally. With no communication and just the tip currently in my ass, I suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream — an instinctual reaction to him shoving his penis full force into my anus. Sadly, my scream wasn’t the only thing that was blood-curdling. Bawling, I ran to bathroom to find that my rectum had been completely torn. Safe to say, we never tried anal again, and what I learned from that experience was that successful anal sex requires proper communication, a lot of lube, condoms and a boyfriend who actually knows what he’s doing.”<br>\nPush-Pop Puke<br>\n“Two summers ago, me and my current roommate actually used to date. The third and last night we ever hooked up, we went out to a bougie country club for dinner and finished our date at my house over some bottles of wine. Drunk as all hell, our foreplay quickly escalated into sex when I started giving him a blowjob. I won’t say that he was particularly well-endowed or anything, but the combination of alcohol and penis in my throat made my stomach start to feel a little sick. Suddenly, mid-dome, he grabbed my hair and started pushing my head into his crotch. I tried to pull away, but things happened so fast, and before I knew it, I was gagging on his dick. Suddenly, my stomach heaved and I started to puke on his penis. To all the men out there, NEVER push your partner’s head down into your penis during oral unless you want puke-dick to happen to you. Furthermore, be careful about what you eat and drink before giving dome, and never give head on a nauseous stomach.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Really Shitty Sex<br>\n“So I’d been dating this guy for like two months, and we’d been having sex pretty regularly — about once or twice a day. Now, I’m gay, so I usually remember to make sure to ‘use the bathroom’ and clean myself whenever I’m going to bottom. One Sunday, when I’d been pretty hungover all day and stuck at home writing an essay, he texted me saying, ‘What are you up to?’ I knew what he wanted, and as tired and out of it as I felt, I decided that sex might be just the pick-me-up I needed to help me through my hangover. I got to his house, and we started going at it on the couch. He wanted to top, and even though I knew I hadn’t showered or shat that day, I decided that things would probably be fine and consented. He started to thrust in and out of my asshole, when suddenly, a sound that could only be described as a gurgling queef started to come from my butt. He looked at me in shock, and said, ‘Dude, I think we gotta stop for a sec.’ When I looked down at his penis and couch, it was covered in you-know-what. Needless to say, I felt more embarrassed than I’d ever felt in my life, and ran to the bathroom to clean myself. I didn’t even want to try again, and for the record, will never do anal without using the bathroom a couple hours beforehand ever again. That wasn’t just the worst sex I’d ever had; it was truly the shittiest.”</p>\n<p>In closing, bad sex is something that is bound to happen to all of us from time to time, but hopefully, reading stories like these can help you avoid having it in the future, and also make you realize that it happens to all of us. While I only shared four stories with you today, some honorable mentions include “the guy who fucked me grunting like an animal,” “a girl too drunk to remember that she was on her period” and “the guy whose blowjob left me bleeding” — ouch. With that said, we all have bad sex sometimes, so learn to laugh about it and always grow from your mistakes.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni wonders whether or not you can tell which of these stories is his own.  </em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, May 14, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Finally hooking up in that spot you’ve always wanted to hook up in</strong></p>\n<p>You all know the standard spots: Davidson, top of HSSB, Campus Point, etc. But in your last few weeks, the more public, the better. What are you worried about … getting caught? If you’ve been good for the past four years, you’re gonna graduate, so do less worrying and more exploring. You can also make it more personalized; if you have an office (on or off-campus), go for it. If you have a particular South Hall room that you like to study in, go for it. Hell, if you have a single, go for it, and do it in honor of the thousands that will spend the next year or two shacking up with no one but good ol‘ Mom and Dad (God forbid, they learn about shacker calling).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Actually owning a Walk of Shame.</strong></p>\n<p>The “Hump” has been harping on about this since the beginning of time, but it takes real courage ⎯ or at least real senioritis ⎯ to truly do the Walk of Shame with a whole lot of pride. Instead of slinking home, grab the bull by the horns and head straight to Blenders or Bagel Caf, where you’re sure to run into your acquaintances. Pay for your breakfast with money that you procure from deep within your bra. Lounge outside, soak up the sun and humble brag to anyone you encounter. And if you’ve never had the opportunity to take a Walk of Shame, well then …</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Having a one-night stand.</strong></p>\n<p>That guy flirting with you all night at OTT? The girl dancing up on you at EOS? Chances are, they’re just as much in that “end-of-the-year” mindset as you are, so be bold and make the first move. It’s as easy as, “Wanna split an Uber back to I.V.?” Seriously. But from there on out, it’s all on you.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Hitting up your ex.</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve undoubtedly spent the past few years trying to avoid the first person you ever hooked up with at UCSB at all costs. But now, for nostalgia’s sake, take a dive deep into your phone’s contact list and explore the ghosts of hookups past. Shamelessly booty call that one who wronged you, or that one you dumped in a spectacular fashion. Don’t hesitate to blame everything on senioritis: If your attempt falls flat on its face? Senioritis. If it works, but then your friends ask what the hell you were thinking? Senioritis. Just make sure you’re down to hit it and quit it. If you slip back into old habits, you proved that you’ve learned nothing in your time here, and I will personally show up at your house to rip up your diploma.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. Ending that weird relationship that’s been going on for way too long.</strong></p>\n<p>Honey, you are a grown-ass woman/man now. You are about to enter what people on the street are calling “the real world.” Isn’t it about time you started loving yourself? If you wake up one day in the next six weeks and realize that you are wasting your time in your current situation, you can just get the fuck out without fear of awkward run-ins or division of friends. Or better yet, use them one last time so that you can check #1 off of your list … and then kick ’em to the curb.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/","id":6187,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6186,6185,6184],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sucks to Suck Part Two: Going Down on the Cabbage Patch","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/surfbort.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/surfbort.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"…and for those of you who don’t know, that’s my favorite way to describe one sexual act that too many guys seem to overlook: cunnilingus.

Now as a gay man, it should not surprise you that just the idea of eating out a girl used to make me shudder, and that’s coming from someone who eats out ass for pleasure. There’s just something about the vagina that makes many straight men a little nervous. They expect head as if it were a necessary precursor to sex, but girls don’t expect oral in the same way because getting it depends on whether or not guys are willing to give it. As such, I’m here to give everyone some advice on going down and eating out so that everyone understands that both guys and girls should be getting theirs when it comes to oral sex.</p>\n<p>First of all, one problem I’ve noticed a lot of girls talk to me about, is the fact that many guys aren’t naturally inclined to go down on them. When foreplay is going on, a guy might grab a girl’s head and push it down to his crotch to signify that he wants dome, but a girl doing the same is often considered lewd or taboo. If this is a problem in your sex life, you need to tell your man that you want to be eaten out, and if he’s not willing to reciprocate, start to think about whether or not he really cares about your needs — girls who want oral sex should be getting oral sex.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I’ve also talked to many girls who are afraid to be eaten out. In the same way I was nervous about having my ass licked by sexual partners for a long time, girls can be uncomfortable about guys going down on their vaginas — nervous about how it looks, tastes, etc. Now I’m not saying that every girl needs to be eaten out, but I will say that a lot of this self-conscious fear stems from the fact that guys don’t give head as often as they get dome, and as a result, girls aren’t accustomed to how guys will react to their pussies head on. Still, what I’ve learned over time is that being eaten out more often helps alleviate this self-conscious fear and makes you realize that your entire body — face, curves, labias, clitoris … everything — will be sexy and beautiful to the people having sex with you if they really do feel a sexual connection with you.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Once the preparatory fear of cunnilingus is overcome, some of the other problems couples have regarding oral is that not all guys know how to do it. I have lots of girlfriends who will admit that they’re not very good at head and want to get better, but interestingly, every single one of my straight friends will argue that he “gives the best head his girl has ever had” or “always makes his girl come when he eats her out.” My response — that’s bullshit. Guys need to realize that they’re not born with some innate, superhuman ability to force orgasms out of girls with their tongues, and that many of the orgasms they think they’ve given are really just pleas to end shitty head — fake orgasms. ‘Sup guys, want to change that? Then listen up, because there’s always room for improvement in sex, and the first thing you need to realize about oral is that it’s not that hard to give. Nonetheless, you need to be prepared to hone your skills with some or all of the following tips:</p>\n<p>1. Make sure she’s wet. If her vagina is dry when you start to eat her out, the experience will be dry as well, so finger her a bit to build up moisture in the area and make sure to part her lips before digging in so different parts of the vagina are exposed for maximum pleasure.</p>\n<p>2. When you begin to eat a girl out, don’t pretend that your tongue is a penis and stick it in and out of the vagina like a hummingbird digging for nectar. You want to spend most of your time licking up and down the clitoris, a hotspot of pleasure in girls at the junction of the labia minora (inner lips) of the vagina. Clitoral orgasms are actually the most intense a girl can have — yes, stronger than G-spot orgasms — so if you want a girl to scream in real pleasure and not fake boredom, focus most of your oral attention here.</p>\n<p>3. Just as you expect girls to use their hands during blow jobs, use yours when going down. Pinch her nipples, rub her midsection and stop giving head every couple of seconds to kiss other parts of her body while fingering her clit — these changeups will excite her sexually and leave her guessing as to what you’re going to do next.</p>\n<p>4. If you’re really inexperienced when it comes to servicing the vag, write your name or spell out the alphabet on hers with your tongue. This might sound strange, but it’s an easy way to create pleasure if you don’t have much skill going down on a girl. In doing this, you will very quickly learn what tongue movement patterns your girl responds to best, and can better respond to her specific oral needs.</p>\n<p>5. They might call it blow, but occasional sucking on the labia (lips) of a girl can actually create lots of pleasure for her … do this, and she’ll be sure to come in no time.</p>\n<p>6. Apply pressure with your tongue. Lots of guys think that eating out a girl involves just licking her vagina, but in reality, applying pressure with your tongue creates very pleasurable sensations for her that will result in a very intense orgasm that she probably won’t see coming. Even if you’re just eating her out for foreplay, this pressure can build up sexual tension that can help ensure her orgasm when you’re actually having sex — something that many men fail to give.</p>\n<p>7. Watch her face. You’ll know what your girl does and doesn’t like based on the faces that she makes when you eat her out. In watching her body language, listen for her moans and watch for moments of displeasure, because in doing that you’ll quickly learn how to best eat out your girl in a subtle way that doesn’t involve you having to literally ask her.</p>\n<p>8. I don’t think I’ve ever written an article that didn’t involve this next tip, so as I always advise, communicate with your partner. While I did just say that watching her body language is a nice way to be less awkward about finding out what she likes, building a healthy sexual relationship with someone also involves proper communication to ensure that both parties are comfortable and happy during all sexual acts.</p>\n<p>In closing, there you have it: my guide to oral sex. From here on out, never again believe that it sucks to suck, or be afraid to take a trip down to the cabbage patch. Great oral means great foreplay, and great foreplay means bigger orgasms and better sex. Guys, don’t be afraid to go down on your girlfriends, fuck buddies or even one night stands, because girls who receive good head are much more likely to give it in the future. As my straight roommate often says, dive into that pussy like the deep end of a swimming pool and make waves. Big. Fucking. Waves.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is very, very happy to be gay.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I can tell you that right then and there, my pussy went from a wet oasis to a dried out desert.</p>\n<p>The lights are off, the ambience steamy and sensual.

To accentuate his point, he takes his finger out and teases, “I can taste you like this by licking my finger, but I’d rather use my tongue to play with your clit.” I egg him on, so he sticks his finger in his mouth and does one taste — suddenly his face contorts and he looks like he’s about to gag.

His mom got home after that and he didn’t want to risk getting caught, so he seriously made me climb out of his bedroom window (which was on the second floor). After getting out of the window and climbing on to the ledge above the garage, I discovered how high up I actually was, and being only five feet tall, I definitely freaked out a little. I do not know how I actually succeeded getting back on the ground, but I scratched up my hands pretty badly on the way and never talked to him again. I have not been able to watch “Avatar” since.</p>\n<p>This guy I had a fling with freshman and sophomore year came by one night. I had a twin-sized bunk bed that was dangerously close to the ceiling and even more dangerously squeaky — not an ideal hook-up spot in a house with thin walls and a lot of housemates. Next to the lofted squeak was my desk chair, a little wooden seat that I had studied in since my preteen years. Despite its nearly antique build, we decided to get bare on my chair. He sat down facing me, and I eased down on top of him to sit facing him. The second we started thrusting, however, one of the legs on the chair popped out from under us and we went toppling over, hitting the ground hard and laughing even harder. We ended up just going at it on the floor and he even screwed the chair leg back into its nook after he finished screwing a different nook. The chair is still standing to this day, but it hasn’t seen any action since that night.</p>\n<p>I felt pretty bad about sexiling this guy’s roommate … until I woke up the next morning to him … in his bed across the room … staring directly into my eyes. Unsettling, to say the least.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I thought it would be romantic to take a bath together. We had the bubbles, candles and steamy water drawn and the mood was set. We stripped down and he slipped into the tub first. I slinked over and put my feet on either side of his reclined body, facing toward him and away from the shower head and bath faucet. As I tried to sexily dip down on top of him and was nearly in a squat position, I saw a smirk cross his face and felt a cold, sharp pang in my butt, sending me leaping up in cries and screams. The bath faucet knob had oh-so-perfectly aligned itself to nearly pop my anal virginity, and my boyfriend — who didn’t warn me in the seconds before it happened — thought it was hilarious. Needless to say, he bathed alone that night.</p>\n<p>My life is a sex blooper…</p>\n<p>I had been hooking up with this girl, and we went around back at this party so we could have a bit of fun. She started giving me a handjob and, suffice to say, the pain was excruciating. So bad, in fact that I had to break things off with her later that night… I don’t really feel all that bad about it, though, because now she’s a model and significantly more attractive than me.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, while engaging in vigorous coitus with my femme fatale, I was struck with the sudden, insatiable desire to finger m’girl’s pooper. Being the suave gentleman that I am I couldn’t just shove it in of course, so I set about caressing the back of her thigh with my index finger and going in for the kill several moments before she climaxed. Upon entering her I was immediately greeted with the stench and texture of human shit. Unsuprising, if you take a moment to think about it. But what happened next was almost indescribable. Instead of plugging the proverbial leak in the dyke (no pun intended), my anal expedition managed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back and from her poured a massive, massive shit that covered my whole arm. Screaming wildly, I disentangled myself from her and the mountain of feces and ran into the bathroom to flush my arm in the toilet while my femme fatale just sat there screaming. Now every time I have the sex (we have since separated), I get the smallest whiff of flatulence and the fucking is such stanky sorrow.</p>\n<p>The day after I broke up with my ex, we met up for “closure” a.k.a. break-up sex. Distracted by the situation at hand, I ignored my phone for several hours. My nosy best friend, worried about my emotional state post-breakup, went looking for me everywhere — including my ex’s apartment. She walked in on us mid-act. Busted. Always make sure you lock the doors before you have secret sex with an ex.</p>\n<p>The last girl I was with thought that I was really into having my earlobes sucked, so one night she gave me the “special treatment” and went at it for well over 20 minutes. It started to hurt after about the first five, but she just kept right on going, sucking harder and harder. I just didn’t have the heart to tell her that my earlobes were about one suck away from exploding. The next day they swelled up to about double their original size and, after a couple of days, they started peeling because they had been so inflated.</p>\n<p>I woke up one morning after a friend’s party to this girl who I had hooked up with a couple times grinding on me. She had a boyfriend and we had extensively discussed that we could not hook up anymore so long as she was taken, but she felt that grinding her vag on me was A-Ok, as long as she didn’t kiss me. I pretended to be asleep throughout pretty much the whole thing, so I basically laid there with a boner (I’m only human) pretending to be unresponsive for at least 15 minutes while she just went at it. I still don’t know if she thought I was actually asleep or just so overcome with bliss that I couldn’t even open my eyes.</p>\n<p>I was in a photobooth with some girl at a party and we started to get into it when another girl came up and opened the curtain. Apparently the girl I was with had a problem with this other girl, because she immediately punched her out and casually sat back down. I have never been more terrified to hook up with anybody, but what choice did I have? The girl had a mean right hook…</p>\n<p><em>This is a collection of anonymous stories.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 16, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

And being as open as I am, all eyes were on me when it came to rehashing our weekend adventures — the good, the quick and the ugly.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the quality, I was always open to talk sex with my friends because sex in college and during our adolescent years can be fantastic (worth talking about) or it can be downright hilarious due to the general lack of experience (perhaps even more worthy of rehashing). If you get pleasured right, you’ll want the world to know too, trust me. And if you’re getting pleasured wrong (aka, not pleasured at all), all you want to do is laugh about “That One Time When…” Basically, I always felt that talking sex gave me the opportunity to turn a terrible experience into a funny one.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are some things one should keep to themselves, and most people know right away when that line is being crossed. For example, one of the basic rules I like to stick to is never, ever demean anyone; we all have bad sex sometimes, but that’s no excuse for talking shit. However, when it’s casual, why not discuss it with friends? I am a female, and the last thing I want to be is called a “slut” or to feel shame-faced when people realize I am not the Virgin Mary. I love who I am, and every person should; loving your sexuality is okay! Sex can be fun and pleasurable — most of the time — but if you feel ashamed to be doing it, don’t do it. Just don’t judge a person for loving their sex life, because different things work for different people.</p>\n<p>Talking about it isn’t for everyone, but it really does help to have a person that you trust to talk about stuff. It keeps the head in balance and keeps the mind free of all of the worries that a one-night stand can bring. Sometimes, it’s as simple as needing your best friend to reassure you (even falsely) that the guy or girl from last night was a definite 10. And sometimes, your conversations can delve as deep as exploring your sexuality further, or talking out any problems that have arisen in the bedroom with a third party.</p>\n<p>Essentially, being able to talk about sex with someone can not only give you peace of mind, but can also give you insight into expanding your sexual horizons. Communication is key, so stop let’s judging and start conversing.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer wants to talk about sex, baaaaby.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 9, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

She kisses his neck, then his lips, finally moving down his torso towards his navel — he immediately pulls down his boxers. As she starts licking his shaft and going down on his member, he grabs her hair and starts moaning in pleasure. Suddenly, he yells in pain, “Teeth … teeth!!!” She pulls off, embarrassed. This now becomes an anxious situation that is all too familiar for many couples who engage in oral sex.</p>\n<p>It’s always been funny to me the way the word “suck” has such a negative connotation in our society. You can “suck” on a test, have a “sucky” TA, “suck” at drinking and of course, “suck” at just that — sucking. In reality, it’s not surprising the number of girls who don’t know how to give good blow jobs or guys who need pointers on eating girls out. More recently, I’ve come to realize that most people don’t know how to give good oral because men and women are built so differently. A guy who hasn’t specifically practiced oral on a girl might not know that the clitoral hood is where he should focus his licking, and some girls I’ve talked to actually think that dome should involve sucking on a penis like a vacuum — ouch! The thought itself makes me happy to be gay. On that note, I can tell you without hesitation that guys have always given me better blow jobs than girls. Looking back to my closet days — yes, there was a time when I thought myself to be straight — I didn’t even like getting head because girls would either suck too hard, squeeze my balls too vigorously or simply leave me in more pain than pleasure. Now I’m just as down for S&amp;M as the next sex-crazed Gaucho, but pain can be really unsettling during a blow job and unless you want to turn your boyfriends gay like my first girlfriend did, you need to know what you’re doing. So here are some tips on the wonders down under, part one of a two-series column regarding oral sex: a bible of sorts on how to stop sucking at sucking.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>1. Contrary to popular belief, a great blow job should entail more non-sucking “up and down” motion on the penis than anything else. I want you to take your dominant hand, make an “o,” place it to your closed mouth with your thumb touching your bottom lip, and move your head forward and backward while rotating your hand. This is exactly what you should be doing for 40-50 percent of a good blow job.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. While doing this, use your free hand to tickle his balls or stroke his perineum, as this will intensify pleasure by stimulating the nerves all around his groin rather than just those in his dick. Note that I said tickle, not squeeze. Please, for the sake of all men, don’t squeeze — that shit sucks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. About every 15-20 seconds, take your mouth off of his penis and move to the base of his balls. Then, lick along the line separating his left and right nuts, up his shaft and finally to the head of his penis (see tip four). I don’t know what it is about licking the length of a man’s groin that feels so good, but it just does.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The head of the penis, little do many girls know, is its most sensitive region. When you want to change things up a bit, pull down his foreskin — if he has one — and swirl your mouth around the head while swishing your tongue in circles. If he’s uncut, lick the skin on the back of the head connecting it to the shaft. Uncut men actually experience more pleasure during sex because this flap of skin, called the “ridged band,” is still intact. As such, utilize it whenever possible.</p>\n<p>5. Don’t use your teeth. Ever. No one likes it. I don’t care if Cosmo magazine brings up some cool new technique that involves nibbling his shaft — because yes, I actually read this, and the thought itself makes me shudder — just don’t do it. Tooth-to-dick scraping is easily the number one way to ruin what could’ve been great dome, so practice tucking your lips over your teeth while blowing some phallic object like a banana and know that this will really help you hone your skills.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. Deep throat feels ridiculously good during a blow job, but not all girls can do it without gagging. I know lots of guys who think that gagging is hot, but I’m pretty sure most wouldn’t be as stoked after experiencing puke dick — yep, it’s a thing. So I’m going to let you in on a little gay man’s secret: whenever I brush my teeth, I brush the back of my tongue as well. This desensitizes that area and makes deep throating even the biggest of dicks a breeze.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7. If you want to make him come during oral, realize that it is more so the use of your hand rather than your mouth that actually builds up sexual tension in his prostate gland. Shake fast but lightly for 5-10 seconds in between blowing periods if you want him to come, but don’t ever squeeze his penis too hard, as this can be really uncomfortable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8. When he’s about to come — something you’ll know because his abs will begin to flex rhythmically — you have to decide: spit or swallow. While most men I know, myself included, prefer when people swallow, the taste of semen can deter one from doing so. One possible solution? Ask your man to eat pineapples or sweet fruits throughout the day. It might sound weird, but sweet citrus fruits are known to give semen a sweet taste and make it much more bearable to swallow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>9. Communicate. Good sex is all about communication, and because everyone is different, find out if your man likes what you’re doing and change things up a bit if he doesn’t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10. Make sure you get yours. While this isn’t really a tip on giving blow jobs, it’s absolutely ridiculous that some guys expect head without wanting to give it themselves. Heck, I’ve done it and I’m gay. So next time your boyfriend complains about not wanting to eat you out, tell him that if Matt Togni can do it, so can he.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All in all, the key to giving good blow jobs is knowing what does and doesn’t feel good for your man. Girls don’t have penises, so hopefully these tips will help y’all understand what guys generally do and don’t like. Be sure to talk to him about oral etiquette as well, as many girls don’t like when guys press their heads down or pull vigorously on their hair, but never actually tell their boyfriends to stop. For the men reading this, stay tuned for my next column about eating out: I just did all of you a big favor in teaching your girlfriends how to give dome, but let’s not forget that the majority of problems regarding oral sex lie in the fact that it’s you who “suck,” not them.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni wonders what his life would be like now if his first girlfriend gave better head.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 2, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

However, there is always the big question that takes up residence in my head when I’ve just had an enjoyable night — do I stay or do I go? As a girl with intimacy issues, my head is almost always saying “GO,” but let’s explore the pros and cons of both sides.</p>\n<p>After a one-night stand, the last thing I want to do is wake up to a person I’ve just met, so of course, I usually tend to do the whole, “sneak out as soon as he’s asleep” thing. Because no matter how much fun you just had, no one really wants to do the walk of shame — well, I know I don’t. The problem with the Walk of Shame is that the better you looked the night before, the more embarrassing your walk home will be in the morning. By the light of day, that little black dress and the remnants of a smoky eye will have you praying that rather than recognizing you, people will just mistake you for a confused I.V. raccoon. By the way, guys, you have no idea how good you have it.</p>\n<p>However, I’ve also had times where I’ve had to stay the night, simply because the sex was so good that walking home afterwards didn’t seem possible without falling asleep halfway home, or because the prospect of calling a CSO to pick me up from my booty call just seemed like it’d be too awkward. But for this situation, lemme recommend you turn that Walk of Shame into a Stride of Pride, no matter what the night before was like. Own that messy hair and makeup. Walk down DP rather than shrinking down Sabado or Trigo. Heck, go take advantage of the Walk of Shame special at South Coast Deli.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So when you’re dealing with one-night stands or casual hookups, it seems that there will always be the inevitable questions of, “How do I ask them to leave without being rude?” or, “How do I let them know that I want them to spend the night?” Well, I think I can safely say that I have been on either side of both encounters: having to ask a person to leave my bed, inviting him to stay, knowing when it’s time for me to leave, being asked to stay and not wanting to, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>For someone who struggles with intimacy issues, the question of how to nicely kick someone out is too real. I know that I hate it when a guy attempts to spend the night in my bed; it’s already too small for me, so what makes you think I’d want to share it with you? So how does one kick a person out? For one, don’t be afraid to voice how you feel. This is your bed and if you want it to yourself, that’s your prerogative. But obviously, you want to try to drive them away in the most respectful manner possible; you never know when you might want to hit them up again. When in doubt, the simple, “I’m really tired and I have an early day tomorrow; the last thing I’d want to do is wake you up early,” usually works like a charm. We college students really value our sleep.</p>\n<p>But if you want the best chances of sleeping in your own bed without having to share it, I shall quote the wise words of YG: “Toot It and Boot It.” Maybe having your prize of the night go back to your place isn’t actually the smartest idea — go to theirs so you can sneak out without the guilt of feeling terrible for asking them to leave. Sex is fun (hopefully), but if you don’t want to stay the night, get out. The last thing I want for a partner is for them to feel forced to stay the night just because I had sex with them. I know that cuddling is fun for some, but you might as well save that for your body pillow because I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>And then there are the problems that come with dating a person for a while: taking it slow, and finally deciding to sleep together. Do you stay or do you go? Most people would say stay, obviously; you’ve been dating them, so why not? Yeah, I see where you’re coming from, but that’s not me. As previously mentioned, I like my bed to myself. And even if I’m dating a guy, getting me into bed is one thing but getting me to stay is wholly another. I say this because as a woman, it takes a lot for me to look my best and if I’ve just started dating you, I only want you to see me when I’m a 10. Therefore I can’t stay the night — while bedhead and last night’s makeup look good on some, as I’ve mentioned before, I feel that I tend to look less than desirable the morning after. Furthermore, I don’t see a problem with not wanting to spend the night with a partner — who wants to wake up with their morning breath in your face or their snoring loudly in your ear? As cynical as this may sound, I do believe that there’s nothing more exhilarating than caring about a person and exposing yourself to them. But until we get to that point in our relationship, I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>So, while the perks of dating a person can include being truly honest and intimate with your partner (including about how bad you look the next morning), the perks of one-night stands are not caring about leaving after the deed has been done. So yes, sometimes a sacrifice has to be made in order to expand your sexual horizons, but the thrill of leaving a freshly worn-out bed can be oh so fun. So let me enjoy myself and let me pleasure you, and then let us part our ways because I don’t want to wake up to you; sorry ’bout it.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer has nothing but sympathy for the raccoons of Isla Vista.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
