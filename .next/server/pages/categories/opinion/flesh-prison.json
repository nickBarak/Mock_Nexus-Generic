My arms were hairy, my legs were hairy, my eyebrows looked like caterpillars — the whole works. I’m proud to say that by the time I got to high school, I was already kind of over it. Who the fuck cares if I have hair on my arms? Of course, every so often a blunt child I was babysitting would still point it out, but it just didn’t bother me the way it used to. I assumed that anyone else who had suffered these insecurities was probably over it by now, too. It wasn’t until I learned that one of my best friends shaved her arms about as frequently as she shaved her legs that I realized this was still a problem for women my age.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we care so much about regulating female body hair? It all starts with razor companies. </span><a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillette patented the safety razor in 1904</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it grew in popularity, being clean shaven became a symbol of basic hygiene. This made at least a little sense at the time: Because many people were living in close quarters and had limited access to bathing, shaving was seen as a way to prevent lice and bacteria. This idea was </span><a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/shaving-ads-1920s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily marketed to men</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; to be clean shaven was to be a hygienic and civilized man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1920s, things began to change. With a new decade came new fashion trends, and we all know what the 20s are famous for: flapper dresses. This meant that women’s hairy armpits and legs were on full display. </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/137072-100-years-of-shaving-ads-show-how-weve-been-tricked-into-going-hairless-photos\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Razor companies saw this as an opportunity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell more razors and began telling women they needed to be smooth. The epidemic spiraled from there, and now generations of women are worried about everything from the hair between their eyebrows to the knuckles of their toes and everything in between. A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s pretty fucking ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, so I decided to talk to other women about their relationships to their body hair and how they may or may not have come to embrace it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first woman I talked to was Nisha Jagota, a fourth-year student here at UCSB. One memory that Jagota shared was from fifth grade, when she and her friends discussed what they should and shouldn’t shave before a pool party. “We all got together as a group, like, ‘okay, what’s acceptable, what should we do?’ Nobody had it figured out. Nobody has a good idea of what’s ’right’ so everything’s really convoluted,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From as young an age as 10 or 11, girls already know that they will be judged. They know that there is a “right” and a “wrong,” but the standard is so arbitrary that they’re left guessing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagota told me that she hasn’t worried too much about her body hair since coming to UCSB. One of the biggest moments for her in the journey of her changing relationship with her body hair was participating in the Vagina Monologues and spending time with other women who wore their hair however they wanted to. “It was really great being surrounded by all different types of women, and nonbinary folk as well,” she said. “And visually seeing women who had unshaved armpits wearing tank tops and bras … I’m not gonna say they were making a statement, because maybe they’re not, maybe it’s just for them, but for me, it really was them making a statement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madi Braum, another student here at UCSB, had a similar experience after leaving high school. “I started shaving my legs consistently when I was in sixth grade, before I even really needed to,” she said. “But for years after that, I refused to go outside the house in shorts if my legs weren’t shaved.” After graduating from high school, however, Braum said something “clicked,” and she hasn’t shaved since. It’s been three years since she put a razor blade to her shins.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dana Laufer is a third-year student at UCSB, and her first memory of being shamed for her body hair is from fifth grade. “I raised my hand in class to answer a question, and a girl said, ‘Oh my god, Dana has armpit hair.’” When she went home that day, she told her mom what happened, and she taught Dana how to use Nair to remove the hair from her armpits, resulting in painful burns that kept her from attending school the following day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Dana got to high school, shaving felt more like an option than a necessity. “My brother used to say it was gross when girls don’t shave their legs,” she said, “but in high school, my friend and I used to have competitions to see who could go the longest without shaving their legs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no interest in telling anyone how they should maintain the hair on their body. I personally like it when my legs are smooth. However, had I not been socialized to believe that hairy legs are gross, it might be a different story. More than anything, I want every person to be able to make choices that work for them without being subjected to any outside pressure. Let’s just let hairy girls live. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants women to do whatever they damn want with their body hair.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

I learned to appreciate the curves I was developing, but I still couldn’t find peace from the constant thoughts running through my mind. I was learning body positivity, but it was like putting a Band-Aid on a wound that needed stitches. Some days it worked, and other days, it really didn’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contemporary</span><a href=\"https://fusion.tv/story/582813/a-short-history-of-body-positivity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> body positivity movement </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be traced back to around 1960, and since then has grown into a massive ideology that can be found all over the media today. Body positivity is essentially the belief that everyone should feel that their bodies are beautiful. The movement began by centering on reclaiming words like “fat” and “plus-size,” turning them into descriptors rather than insults or words to be ashamed of. Someone can be beautiful and also be fat — they are by no means mutually exclusive. This is how the movement began, and since then, it has expanded to include queer bodies, bodies of color and disabled bodies. Bottom line: Everyone is beautiful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a movement that I wholeheartedly embrace, and I’ve seen it help so many people grow to love themselves more fully and truly. That just wasn’t the case for me.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I got to college that I noticed a change in myself: I slowly stopped caring about what my body looked like. In fact, I forgot to worry about my body at all. Maybe that was the secret: Just don’t think about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I came across the phrase “body neutrality.” </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-body-neutrality_n_5b61d8f9e4b0de86f49d31b4?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACd-gHx8KbrbEr03nIJ1Wr8SW67sDdMuv9l21DwyVphhb54vW1xFYzadoEMWJMkxA5SI2hqzLBy7fpUcjFzJViV2iLDsz79LIVOfuwakqFooox8ebpo_jI6mfiqealV-NeoBp5Ese6WXCx0OSG5CbEZ1R4dmH-Fm7RVOsjycIx8A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body neutrality</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the practice of not thinking about your body or how it looks at all. I am an active person, so for me, that means thinking about what my body can do, rather than how it looks. I found that the less I overanalyze how my body looks — even if I’m focusing on the positives — the happier I am. My body can swim and dance and hike. It can eat a ridiculous amount of ice cream without feeling sick (it can’t really handle doughnuts though … we’re working on that) and take me from Campbell Hall to I.V. Theater in less than 10 minutes. I can love and appreciate my body so much more when I stop looking in the mirror. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I choose body neutrality over body positivity, I don’t want to suggest that this is what works for everyone. Body positivity was designed for people who were, and still are, attacked, marginalized and discriminated against because of their size, shape or color. Body positivity could be the best practice for those people, and that is incredible. For me, sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it. And that’s not to say that body neutrality is running away from the problem but rather finding a different solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I began practicing body neutrality by accident and, luckily for me, it worked. I found myself surrounded by people who just didn’t talk about their bodies in the way I was used to. Our lives were about picking a major and studying for midterms. They were about exploring a new campus and a new city. Sorry, no time to worry about whether or not my thighs are touching — I have class in 10 minutes and an essay due at midnight. Body positivity might not be for everyone, so why not give body neutrality a try?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa recommends getting rid of all the mirrors in your house.   </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

My heart sank. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not again.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exams had been appearing in my calendar incessantly. Routine took over my college days: class, work, study, research, work, study, sleep, repeat. The colorful EBT CalFresh card in my wallet had been untouched for a week … or two … and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, “skinny” translates into weak. This direct correlation comes from growing up remarkably underweight. Eating was a daily struggle. My lovely grandparents who raised me had no choice but to force food down my throat to keep me from becoming dangerously malnourished. When left unsupervised, I shoveled rice into my mouth before sneaking to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. I remember too vividly the countless evenings of sulking with my tear-streamed cheek on the wooden dining room table, not far from my chopsticks, small bowl of cold rice and various dishes of vegetables and Chinese sausages. I was genuinely repulsed by the thought of putting food into my body.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My unhealthy relationship with food continued roughly until the beginning of high school. I wanted to focus on reading books, completing an endless stack of worksheets and organizing my chores. I wanted to get things done. I couldn’t afford to simply just sit there and consume various substances for so many minutes of the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet, I desperately wished that the people around me would state something besides the obvious; even at such a young age, I was sick of being defined by my strikingly thin figure. Why did my weight matter? What if I just had a high metabolism? What do they know? During what seemed to be the longest years of my life, I grew increasingly weary of people telling me that I had to eat. At gatherings, my aunts, uncles, cousins and family friends voiced the same annoying comment: “You’re so skinny!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obligatorily, I began consuming the food that was placed in front of me without having a tantrum about it. Overlapping food groups in my bowl was still unacceptable, but I stopped passing the protein off to my sisters, living with the mindset that eating was just a required chore in order to get on with the rest of the day. I’m not sure what triggered my sudden desire to please the people around me. Or maybe I was just fed up. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unique biological nature of every individual makes it impossible for everyone to maintain the same figure, but that’s not what the media advertises.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he differences were noticeable: As I gradually stopped handing off (and flushing down) my food, focusing on the present became significantly easier. Academics were much more tolerable; socializing was no longer so draining. I was daydreaming significantly less. Of course, the correlation between eating more and becoming a livelier person was not immediately evident but revealed itself over time. Eventually, I even started taking the initiative to make plans</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to go out and eat with friends. For the first time in my life, I was no longer 10 to 20 pounds underweight. My doctor was extremely proud of me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many people who struggle with being underweight, my extreme lack of appetite was and still is a massive side dish for my familiar main course: stress. From time to time, I find myself ignoring what my body wants and needs, especially when I am determined to complete a task or project before a deadline. Every individual responds to stress differently; I was briefly prone to stress eating, but I am learning that my body prefers neglecting food instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can tell when I’m losing weight: I go throughout my day subconsciously aiming to consume the bare minimum of each food group, allowing my thoughts and fears to feed my appetite instead. Sometimes, I check myself by thinking about my sister’s banana bread; I know it’s bad when even the thought of her baking doesn’t seem appealing. It’s important that I am aware of when this happens, so I can take a step back and reorder my priorities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, “skinny” is viewed as “healthy.” The issue with ideal body images is that weight is based on heavily malleable variables of standard body weight, shapes and other physical attributes. The unique biological nature of every individual makes it impossible for everyone to maintain the same figure, but that’s not what the media advertises. People need to feel more encouraged to work with, rather than against, their natural genetic compositions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undoubtedly, people still call me “skinny” today, but I no longer care about how others see me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest difference between my past-skinny and present-skinny self is my newfound focus on positive mental energy and physical strength. For my body, this combination can only be achieved by eating certain amounts and types of foods, such as by moderating my Hot Cheetos Puffs and strawberry-flavored Pocky intakes. After discovering the hard way how diet impacts my mindset and energy level, my goal is not to count calories. Adding up the numbers every day would not benefit my mental health, so I don’t do it. I know people who rely on numbers to keep them feeling their best, and I respect that. Each body is different, so do what works for you. But I say that self-care is the new skinny.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anna Zhou wants to increase her physical strength so she can haul her groceries up the stairs in one go. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/","id":5671,"author":{"id":376,"name":"Anna Zhou"},"related":[5670,5669,5668],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Living In A Fog","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Flesh Prison","publish_date":"2019-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?resize=650%2C488&ssl=1","description":"Hannah Peck writes about the physical and emotional devastation caused by her concussion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month, I was biking in front of the HSSB, panting as I heard the bell ring for my 11 a.m. class. I was late again, of course. I was trying to pass a sad and slow beach cruiser when I noticed a speedy road bike attempting to do the very same. He went to shoot the gap between me and the cruiser, and in doing so, pushed me into the oncoming bike traffic. In what felt like a single heartbeat, I was on the floor, my bike was on top of me, my phone was thrown across the path and my legs were covered in blood. I was left with was a splitting pain between my ears. At the moment, I had no idea why. Within seconds, I was surrounded by five kind strangers who were eager to help me get up and out of harm’s way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hadn’t realized yet just how hurt I was. I sat under a tree with my face in my hands, utterly embarrassed that everyone had just seen me wipe out. A nice man asked if I was okay since he apparently saw me hit my head on the ground. I tried telling him that I didn’t hit my head at all. He pressed on my temple to show me I was wrong.

This was the second brain injury I received at UCSB and I was most likely going to miss the rest of the soccer season. The way I saw it, my life was over. The thing about concussions is that you can only really understand what it feels like if you’ve had one before. Empathy is not possible. It is not just a bad headache that won’t go away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who you are and which part of the brain you have injured, your symptoms will be vastly different. People who </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786154/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">injure their prefrontal lobe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are likely to experience a personality shift as well as disassociation with the mind and body. When I fell off my bike, I hit my left temple on the pavement, inflaming my temporal lobe. This segment of the brain controls and regulates your emotions, language comprehension and auditory perception. Because of this, I was in a bitchy mood, sucked in Spanish class and had the hearing capacity of my 85-year-old grandpa. That month was devastating — and yet, thanks to the fog, feels as though it never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends and family ask what a concussion feels like, I freeze. There are no words with which you can articulate it. You just hope and pray they never have to experience it firsthand. The best way to describe the period of concussion is like you’re living in a fog. This fog is plagued by clouds of migraines, introspective thoughts and fears that you will never make it out. Sadly, </span><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-dangers-of-ignoring-concussions/article17992226/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some people do not recover from a concussion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially if they suffer three or more in their pre-adult lives. I was one of the lucky ones.  My teammate Kayla has received five major concussions and seriously believes she is a different person because of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is recognizing this shift in personality that causes people to become depressed. They daydream about how they used to act, think, speak and even walk. Day by day, their past selves becomes more and more a stranger to them. I myself felt this depression. Even though this was difficult to go through, the fog had its upsides as well. I even grew to know my best friend better.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing about concussions is that you can only really understand what it feels like if you’ve had one before.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best friend was diagnosed with clinical depression when she was 12 years old. Every year, her condition became more and more apparent. She saw a therapist twice a week and took three forms of medication daily. As her best friend, I was there for her whenever she needed me — whether this meant providing her a home to escape to, a shoulder to cry on or even an ear when she felt she could not trust her doctor. Slowly throughout the course of high school, I became her therapist. The pay wasn’t great, but it felt nice to help her out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always wished I could do more. I could only sympathize with what she was going through. I had never been depressed before, so of course, I couldn’t really know what was going on in her head. At lunch, I would research WebMD articles on depression and anxiety, hoping to get her answers and hoping to be a better therapist. I now realize this issue applies to concussions as well. You don’t really know what people are going through unless you’ve been there yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued to be there for Bella, even when we left to attend different universities. I became a long-distance therapist. We would FaceTime roughly five times a week, hoping to ease her nerves as she settled into her new life at the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Colorado, Boulder</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first time, we were in different states. For the first time, a phone call was my only way to comfort her. For the first time, I could not be there for her to the best of my ability. This ate at me. I was constantly worried about her. If I had not heard from her in two days, I knew something was wrong. She needed her therapist, but I was off dancing down Del Playa and tanning on the Anacapa lawn. I felt guilty. I had it so easy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My world came to a halt when I got my concussion. I was unable to do anything on my own for over a month and my GPA suffered tremendously. I became socially awkward, I lost my sense of adventure, I became introverted and I even forgot what it felt like to feel excited. My world was gray. I learned to exist, rather than to live. But above all else, I began to understand what Bella was going through. For the first time, I did not feel like her therapist. Finally, I could hear her out and understand it completely. For years she had been trying to help me see what it was like to live in a world of gray. Now I knew. So yeah, getting pushed off by bike really sucked — but it allowed me to see my friend and her condition in a whole new light. In a weird way, it felt like we were depressed together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point in our lives, we are bound to feel trapped by the gray and to feel lost in amongst the dreary clouds. I would not have gotten through my concussion if it weren’t for the love and support of those around me. It just goes to show that even on the darkest of days, someone else’s light can burn through your clouds, brighten the gray and clear your fog. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Peck encourages Gauchos to care for their concussed friends. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/","id":5664,"author":{"id":375,"name":"Hannah Peck"},"related":[5663,5662,5661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Life and Death in a Nutshell","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Flesh Prison","publish_date":"2019-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2048-e1557294803721.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2048-e1557294803721.jpg?resize=650%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Harper Lambert writes about living with a fatal food allergy and the surprising lessons she learned along the way.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Try this, it’s delicious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting on the table before me, she looks innocuous enough </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seductive, even.

Two bites into a baguette smeared with vegan cream cheese (what did I tell you?), the alarm bells started ringing. All the telltale signs were there: the itchiness on my tongue; the feeling of sand filling my throat as it constricts; my lips going pillowy with numbness; my swollen eyelids reducing my eyes to slits; and worst of all, the panic that sends adrenaline pinballing through my body, drumming up my heart rate and alighting every nerve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, the first ingredient listed was “RAW CASHEWS.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A moment of callousness and two bites of cream cheese. That’s all it took to launch my immune system into shutdown and my body into the bathroom, where I spent the next hour with my head in the toilet. This time I got lucky: With the aid of some Benadryl, my breathing returned to normal and the vomiting subsided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a thousand ways this situation could have played out, a thousand parallel universes determined by a single detail. What if I hadn’t been with friends who live minutes away from a drugstore? What if I’d been at a party surrounded by strangers? Or in a foreign country? What if my body went into </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anaphylaxis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I didn’t have my </span><a href=\"https://www.epipen.com/what-is-anaphylaxis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Epi-Pen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with me? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have experienced all of these scenarios in some form or another. From hives at holiday parties to barfing at the beach, I’ve seen it all. So it goes without saying that I am grateful my most recent reaction didn’t land me in the hospital, or worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, a tiny, irrational part of me wishes it did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, there is a disparity — a chasm, really — between the emotional and physical scars left by a traumatic event. Each time, my body outpaces my mind in the recovery process; my eyes de-puff before my tears dry. My allergy is life-threatening, meaning that every time I have a reaction, I am faced with the possibility of my own death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That such a serious medical condition is called an “allergy” strikes me as wildly inappropriate. “Allergy” is a silly word that conjures up images of snot-nosed kids and springtime pollen. It undercuts the terror that seizes me when I realize that something tastes “off.” It makes it difficult for others to empathize with my experiences. No, I don’t live with chronic pain or have to inject myself with medicine on a daily basis. Yes, I am otherwise healthy and able-bodied. But when you live your whole life thinking you could die at any meal, it takes an emotional toll.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the more drastic the reaction, the easier it is to cope with it. In the wake of a reaction fraught with dramatic details — pastries, Greece, family vacation, deserted island, paramedic tent, no Epi-Pen — I received an outpouring of sympathy from my friends and family. The intensity of their concern matched the misery of the experience. However, this was an exception, not the rule. Reactions that occur under ordinary circumstances, such as Sunday brunch, don’t elicit the same response even though they are no less terrifying for me. This can be extremely isolating, to say the least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feeling of being heard but not understood makes me want to exaggerate the details of my reactions the way I sometimes embellish stories, a trait at which my friends and family often poke fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck by this as I lay in bed after the Bad Brunch, snapping me out of my post-reaction slump. Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My allergy and I have been attached since birth, our fates tied together by the pad thai noodles that sent me to the hospital at age one. I can’t remember living without it, and </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data indicates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I probably never will. Which means that for better or worse, my nut allergy is woven into the fabric of my being. If personalities are like smoothies — a random blend of family, culture, DNA and environment — who’s to say it wasn’t a formative ingredient? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some manifestations are positive, highlighting aspects of my personality that may have otherwise remained in the shadows. I was always a precocious child, the kind that enjoyed talking to adults and hogged the camera in all the home videos. Yet my engraved emergency bracelet was my first real taste of the spotlight. I would shake my chubby fist at anyone who would listen, reveling in the attention it garnered me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I graduated from bracelet-waving to bragging, as if being in constant latent danger was cool. I feel lucky for myself and my parents that I was such an obnoxious kid, never hesitating to announce my allergy to anyone offering me food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also credit my allergy for my Doomsday Prepper tendencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have to carry a chunky plastic medicine stick and 1-2 tablets of Benadryl with you everywhere, you become one of those people who anticipates disaster at every turn. I have since blossomed into a one-woman drugstore, never without band-aids, floss, tampons or gum on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with a severe allergy also prematurely exposed me to some dark truths. The most heartbreaking lesson of childhood is that your parents can’t protect you from everything</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I learned this early on. Proactive and careful as they were, my parents couldn’t be there every time there was an incident. In fact, they were the accidental perpetrators of a few reactions. To chalk up my neuroses and distrust of adults to a nut allergy might seem, well, nuts, but it can’t be dismissed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s part of who I am, for better or worse. The disadvantages of a fatal allergy are obvious.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They read like the side effects delivered in hyperspeed at the end of a commercial: nausea, vomiting, swelling, redness, anaphylaxis, death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the upsides? I am long past the point of considering attention one of them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o amount of pity or compassion can counteract the trauma or resulting isolation. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the “everything happens for a reason” theory </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s disrespectful toward the victims of senseless tragedies and frankly, it’s bullshit. Some clouds are gray without a touch of silver. Some lemons are just meant to be lemons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite the drawbacks, having a severe allergy has gifted me with an alternative perspective on my own life. Along with all of the other timelines by which we organize our lives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationships, family pets, schools, career milestones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exists my personal history of reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details surrounding these incidents are forever vivid in my mind: the holiday decor at the Christmas Party where I ate white chocolate walnut fudge at age nine; the sunlight and rolling green hills at my second grade field trip, crumbs glinting off the knife that had been used to cut a peanut butter cookie moments before; the security of my mom’s hand around mine when she picked me up from kindergarten after a classmate’s birthday cake made me sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While allergic reactions make for unpleasant memories, they go hand in hand with special moments that I wouldn’t recall otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, one definitive benefit of having a deathly allergy: It gives people a way to show that they care about you. There’s a line in “Lady Bird” that goes, “Don’t you think they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” In this case, I think they are. Considering how nuts are exceedingly normal and harmless for about 95% of the population, a person needs a reason to care about their presence. I am that reason for my loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time someone takes extra precautions to ensure my safety, I feel like they’ve just handed me a present. Like when my friend Samantha insists on asking the waiter if the pizza we ordered has nuts, even though I’ve read the menu twice and pizza never has nuts, idiot. Or when my aunt Millie hands me the bowl of sweet potatoes that she personally prepares for me every Thanksgiving. It’s not just that my people look out for me; it’s that I never have to ask. They’ve already thought of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, living with this condition is perfectly manageable. Unlike many people, I’m fortunate to have a support system that includes access to medical treatment in case of an emergency.

It was Labor Day; we were in a cabin at Tahoe. I was unprepared, it was premature and yes, I bled. That weekend in sixth grade, I became the first of my friends to get my period. At a scrappy Chevron on the way home, my friend’s mom Lisa taught me how to put a pad on my underwear.<br><br>“Then you fold the wings down,” she yelled at me through the cracks of the public restroom. She paused, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “And you’ll <em>feel</em> it when it comes out.” <br><br>It sounded almost pleasurable, the prurient way she said it. I had dozed off during our barebones sex ed class in fifth grade, so upon first seeing those unfamiliar red spots on my ash-white shorts, my imagination ran rampant. I envisioned a sort of magical oil slick oozing neatly into a sanitary pad, to be expected and practiced as an annual fertility rite of womanhood. I surmised that it would happen twice a year, tops, probably aligning with the cosmic patterns of celestial orbs. There was probably a farmer’s almanac I could borrow at the middle school library to help me predict my period next year. Then, I learned that I come from a long line of uteruses that expel blood with the urgency of a firefighter’s hose. I adopted my mother’s many strategies: mesh underwear, double lining pads, sleepless nights on top of the dark towel. <br><br>That summer, my mom and I went on an impromptu European mother-daughter trip. In Rome, during a free Mozart opera concert that bored me to no end, my mom’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. She did not break her gaze from the warbling singers. “Aiya,” she said calmly. “The disaster has come.” I panicked for her. No, she said, she didn’t have any hygienic provisions with her. No, she didn’t have any black pants to change into. Yes, she had bled through. I looked at her khaki trousers that had seemed so smart and graceful moments earlier, and cursed them for her. We conspired to leave the concert with quick paces, me walking mere inches behind her like a sticky shadow.<br><br>Companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (which owns Always, Tampax, Naturella, and Whisper) target women of different countries with different products. The French want the least bulky, the Japanese want the softest material, and Americans want maximum security against leakage, regardless of cost in comfort. When we neared the light of street lamps, I could see the little stains on either side of her crotch, hiding in the creases of her pants as she walked, like a blinking, winking, eyebrow-raising face that mocked our embarrassment. Did the Italianos around us notice? Would they stand and point and laugh at her if they saw her stains? What if we were walking under American streetlights?<br><br>Menstruation is an ongoing civil war waged in between my legs, my ruined underwear its tired battlefield. Month after month, my body triumphantly declares victory over my will. I looked towards a higher power. What could calm the fury that overtook my body every 28 days? God, maybe, or yoga? I dabbled in both to no avail. My pediatrician warily prescribed me birth control and I started Sprintec, a waxy blue envelope of little round pills which is now my constant companion. Sometimes, when I forget to pepper the pill at precisely 9 p.m., I have my period for two straight months. I envied the women whose periods are so infrequent that they buy pregnancy tests. I envied Olympic gymnasts, whose extreme athleticism causes secondary amenorrhea. I envied those without uteruses and I resented their oblivion to our suffering. <br><br>I grew to dread my period, a deep self-hatred dappled with anxiety from frantically shuffling towards the bathroom with a hidden tampon up my sleeve or subtly glancing at my seat every time I stood up. Periods were terrible to start at school. By lunchtime, I’d convene with my friends. “I bled through,” I’d say glumly, defeated yet again. In a practiced ritual, they’d pat me on the shoulder with a sympathetic look. Lisa was right. I felt it. I felt too dirty to exist in public when I was bleeding. <br><br>We bargain with our reflections in the mirror, playing with the cards we were dealt: the cleft chin from your father, the curly hair from your mother, the hooded eyes, the pixie ears, the color of your skin in the winter. Variances of periods are many: menstruation can begin as early as age eight, lasts from two to seven days per cycle and occurs every 21 to 45 days. Periods can be viscous or thin, staining your favorite clothes any shade of crimson and brown. Thus, the period is the last manifestation of this genetic destiny, a hormonal sorting hat declaring your birth-given menstrual fate. As I anticipate the monthly shedding of my uterine lining, I’m reminded of my biological duty to reproduce, my position as almost-mother and future-mother and, at the risk of empathizing with the pro-life movement, my body’s power to create conscious life. No joy can be derived from apologizing for bleeding, sorry after sorry to my light-wash Levi’s and my Advil-scarred stomach. We do not shame the injured for their gushing wounds and broken bones, yet as I’m hurt, month after month, I nurse myself in secrecy. Menstruation is a woman’s first introduction to labor needlessly for the comfort of others.<br><br>When I was 17, I got a Diva Cup. The silicone wonder arrived at my door in a purple box with curlicue writing urging me to join the revolution: “A Better Period Experience,” it promised. The instructions are written in exquisite detail, specifying the locations of the labia and the cervix, as if its user did not know what a vagina is; the Diva Cup knew that many women are strangers to the intricate pains and pleasures of their own bodies. There was no shame in not knowing yet. Holding it by its ribbed stem, the cup is roughly tulip-sized and supple to the touch. Instructions demand some origami first: fold the cup in half from top down or into a U-shape. Then, a choreographed tango: angle the pelvis to the cup in sitting position as you insert, rotating it to ensure a solid seal. If vaginas were capable of feeling anxiety, mine did. As I pushed the Diva Cup in for its maiden voyage, I feared the worst. It might get swallowed up in that orifice and I might have to ask my mom to take me to the ER. It could crumble inside my vagina and probably somehow enter my bloodstream. The cup might turn over, liberating a deluge of blood in the middle of my Russian Literature seminar. It might hurt. Silly doubts, I realize now. The cup felt like nothing and my first period with the Diva Cup was a fucking miracle. Either God or yoga took pity on me; I was no longer drowning in a pool of my own blood and shame.<br><br>Oh, how can I count the ways I love thee, Diva Cup? Besides the physical security in its flawless, ingenious function, the cup is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, safe, comfortable, and convenient alternative. Am I a hormonal Diva for my unorthodox approach to reigning in my menstrual flow? Or is this cup the Diva that translates the dramatic theatre of my cycle to a secret power? I perused their website. “The name Diva originates in Italy, where it was used to describe a female deity, a powerful woman whose talent resembles that of the gods. In the 1800s the name Diva was used to describe a talented woman, leading the way in music and stage. What better way to empower women than by encouraging them to become a menstrual Diva – a leader in period care!”<br><br>Ah. I’m in a harmonious collaboration with menstruation. Ours is a masterpiece worthy of Carnegie and Pompidou. I feel it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kat Chen wants you to buy a Diva Cup for someone you love. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

a suitcase of fancy baby formula </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m picking her baby’s English name. The gravity of this responsibility slicks my palms with sweat whenever it crosses my mind. When parents name their newborns, it is more of a prayer than a name. There’s nothing about a bald mound of fat rolls that says “Paul” or “Beatrice,” yet there’s so much hope that the child will amount to a specific vision of greatness. A baby named Clayton has the potential to become a coked-out Wall Street asshole; a baby named Tallulah could be a raw vegan vlogger based in Portland. But naming your baby Beckham does not predestine her soccer career. The associations we have with names seem arbitrary, but they guide us in evaluating the people we meet. Names carry legacy and heritage, and they are more than a first impression for one individual: they are continuations. They are brands. Every Donald suffers from the reputation of one bad Donald.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The associations we have with names seem arbitrary, but they guide us in evaluating the people we meet.

Most likely, you see yourself as a body swimming with thoughts, emotions and ambitions. Maybe you identify yourself first by your talents, vocations or values: as a climber, a musician, as a communist. It’s difficult to summarize and identify individuality and connect the body that speaks and moves to the person inside. Names are meant to identify and summarize you but ultimately fail to satisfy either role. They’re tenuous ties to someone who you could potentially be and people before you who fulfilled their role under your name. There’s little ownership in being named, little choice in your first introduction to every stranger and every unknown territory. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Names can alienate you too. They can be false prophets. For many trans people, birth names become deadnames. Just think: we didn’t always introduce ourselves with preferred pronouns. I distinctly remember the moment in high school when we began our class by reintroducing ourselves with pronouns to the people we had grown up with. It felt odd at first, entering this ritual so bare and true. What used to be intimate confessions became declarations. It was a terrifying comfort; we held our breath as one, passing it around the room, as each of us entered the space as pretend-strangers. It was an opportunity to reenter the known realms of our world and it reminded me of Harvey Milk shouting at all of us to come out of the closet. To tell our neighbors that their grocer is queer, that their children are queer, that their friends are queer. Milk politicized coming out: it was powerful, he implied, for the greater good of our community. Maybe you still live in your deadname; it is not anyone’s place to tell you to come out. It is a privilege to understand identity; it is a greater privilege to perform your truth in the total safety of your reality. But in my English seminar, at age 17, I attended my friends’ self-christenings. I don’t claim that announcing our preferred pronouns made queerness definitively easier, but some of us were practicing for Harvey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was named by my mother’s MBA professor’s daughter, who was fourteen and apparently named me after a cinematic Catherine. The jury is still out on if it was Zeta-Jones or Deneuve, but I hope my mom got a good grade in that class. Katherine is a high-maintenance name for divas: Catherine the Great, Katharine Hepburn, Katherine Heigl. Strangers expect applause if they spell it correctly. The Chinese name my mother chose for my legal middle name came from the ancient Chinese classic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spring Autumn Annals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A monk told my aunt I would get into a car crash if I didn’t informally change my name to one with more “fire” in it, so I spent an hour with a Chinese dictionary just so the girls at my middle school could tell me it sounded like “shampoo.” It’s 炫如 (XuànRú), by the way. So much for radical female friendship. My family never called me anything other than “baobao” (Chinese for “treasure”) unless they were royally pissed. I only heard “Katherine” when I was being yelled at in a car. By high school, I started going by “Kat” because I was so triggered by “Katherine,” which I still deeply associate with my mom’s unbridled anger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, we shouldn’t have names until we’re 20. By then, anyone obtuse enough to choose a name like Tampon (a moment of silence for Bella Thorne’s dog) are willing participants in natural selection. But adopting a new name so late in life split me in two: the Katherine before, the Kat after. Coupled with the spice of teenage rebellion, I could not distinguish my growth from my identity crisis. How do celebrities do it? Anna Nicole Smith was Vicky, Guy was Ferry before Fieri, Chef Boyardee was handsomely named Ettore Boiardi (yes, I have a crush on Chef Boyardee). When these famous household names rebranded, were their names purely interchangeable costumes? We were all confused when Snoop announced his transition from canine to feline form, but maybe for him it felt like shedding skin, one era of iconicity to the next. Was reinvention an embodiment of their hopeful ascension to superstardom? Or maybe their name was a protective shield that separated their public performance from their private life, a shield that ricocheted the scrutiny of TMZ onto a exquisitely concocted character.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we name babies, we have so much hope for them: they have no criminal records, no failing grades, no experience with abusive boyfriends.

We want the world to know so desperately that they are special to the people who love them. In a perfect world, people will call me baby, just like the way my mom calls me “baobao.” I want to feel swaddled by strangers when they address me, like a walking, talking ricotta blintz. Baby is not only gender neutral </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it radiates warmth reminiscent of sick days spent drinking soup in my childhood bedroom and plastering Doraemon stickers on my mirror. I want to be called baby until I’m ready to bear the burden of a name. I miss the vulnerability of not recognizing my name in writing before I learned to read. I miss living life without the identifier that was pinned to me at birth. Most of all, baby is a reminder that my name is not a reflection of my corporeal form and all of the wonderful thoughts and abilities you can’t see. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the universal nature of “baby” is a comforting reminder that I am, even at my most beloved state, not special. So many mothers on falling moons cooing at their sleepless babies. So many lovers on rising suns sending their babies good morning texts laden with pink emojis. All of these babies, adored and numbed, daydreaming about finding home in their person. It’s a tired story, so generic it seems cheap, yet there’s solace in being one of many. When it happens for you, you’ll understand. “Ah!” you’ll think, caught off guard, “This is what it feels like to be someone’s prayer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that two-syllable moment, you embody all that is infinitely possible of a fresh newborn. I am someone’s baby, you are someone’s baby; someone will call me baby and someone should call you baby. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kat Chen will kick you in the shins if you call her “babe.”</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

Of course, I kept in mind that salads were a healthy alternative to hamburgers, but I nevertheless enjoyed late nights at In-N-Out with my friends from time to time. I ate primarily balanced meals at home and enjoyed dessert in moderation. My day-to-day life was always filled with physical activity. I rode my bike five miles to school every morning, dog-walked four times a week to make a little extra money, taught children’s dance classes and then took my own classes as well. On weekends, I would take hikes with my friends and family as well as go running atop the hill behind my house. Thus, I never put too much thought into the foods I was eating because all of my physical activity balanced out the food that I would consume.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85449\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85449\" data-attachment-id=\"85449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-07/a-revived-relationship-with-food/food-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85449\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article-188x250.jpg?resize=269%2C358\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jessica Bixby / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going to college was the first time in my life that I would be living away from home. I would now have many new responsibilities, one of them being managing my own food. Fully wary of the freshman 15, I decided to pay close attention to my diet and exercise routine in order to avoid falling into this common fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, my plan bore nothing but favorable</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effects. I ate fruit with my breakfast each morning and made sure to balance every lunch and every dinner with a salad. I enjoyed checking UCSB NetNutrition before serving myself in the dining commons, just to be knowledgeable about the ingredients I was putting on my plate. I began drinking more water and tried to exercise every other day. These were all positive changes in that they got me into a healthy routine among a time of such great change. My skin became clearer and I no longer fell into exhausted slumps after eating as I sometimes would after consuming those heavy In-N-Out burgers. I had never really paid attention to nutrition while living at home, so I felt a mature sense of agency through being able to control the way in which I was powering my body. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these were positive changes to begin with, the goodness was not to last. My careful attention grew into an all-encompassing obsession that bled into every aspect of my life in innumerable negative ways. The health-conscious decisions that started as choices became rules to be followed at all costs: Always drink coffee before breakfast to suppress appetite. Never eat meat. If there is a low-cal alternative, always choose it. Bread, pasta and and rice are all absolute no’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking NetNutrition became the definitive criteria for picking a dining hall. If my friends invited me to Ortega but Carillo served more balanced options, I would formulate some lie explaining why I could not join them, then walk all the way around the lagoon alone in order eat a light meal of low-calorie polenta topped with microgreens. I was never one to skip class in high school, nor at the beginning of college. However, as my fixation progressed, my priorities began to change. If I knew that I would be expected to eat cake for a friend’s birthday that evening, I would skip class in order to make time to exercise so that what I burned would balance out what I ate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighing myself became as much a part of my daily routine as brushing my teeth. I tracked every calorie I ate down to a pinch of vegan parmesan atop my zoodles. I fidgeted throughout all my lectures because sitting still meant minimal calorie burn and minimal calorie burn was bad. When not in lecture, I could be found on a Rec Cen elliptical, pushing my undernourished body to its max. Though I was already quite lean upon entering college, by the end of my freshman year, I had lost 15 percent of my body weight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these behaviors arose when I went away to college, they did not cease when I returned home for the summer. I remember getting invited to a pizza party by a dear high school friend. Although I had no plans for that evening and had not seen my high school friends in six months, I declined the offer. I valued saving the calories by staying home alone more than sharing pizza and good times with friends. The few times I did see my friends, they noted my weight change and concernedly questioned my well-being. I blamed the “pesky dorm plague” for my lack of appetite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that my tendencies were detrimental to my everyday life, but I was so fixated upon the number on the scale that I didn’t care. I stopped getting my period, stopped enjoying spending time with friends and stopped caring about things that were non-food-related.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was one thing, however, that my fixation did not destroy: my dream of studying abroad. After only a few days in Paris for a family vacation when I was 10, I became infatuated by the French language, music and way of life. Since then, I aspired to spend my junior year of college sipping warm espressos reading </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le Petit Prince</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in cozy cafés.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck with elation upon receiving my acceptance email from the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) for the University of Bordeaux’s study abroad program. In a few short months, my decade-long dream would finally materialize. Yet, before departing, I would have to fill out all the mandatory paperwork, one of which was the housing preference form.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My options were single apartment, shared apartment and homestay. Pondering these options, my head began to swirl. I knew that living in a homestay with a French family would be the best way for me to truly experience the French culture in which I so yearned to be immersed. However, choosing a homestay meant living by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">someone else’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rules, adhering to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> schedule and, by all means, eating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food. I shuddered at the idea of willingly forfeiting my diet of kale smoothies, cauliflower rice and tofu scrambles for the rich, creamy, meat-heavy, veggie-lacking French cuisine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite my fear of gaining weight and renouncing all the “healthy changes” I had made during my first two years of college, I did not want to let my obsession tarnish my long-held dream. I checked the homestay box on the form, then closed my laptop with trembling hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I arrived at my homestay, I walked into a home very different from what I was used to; it was exactly what I had dreamed of and more. My host mother’s dwelling was classic Bordelaise, crafted of white limestone and furnished with sun-faded vintage wood. Verdant plants surrounded the living room piano, and books with yellowed pages bound to cracking spines filled the shelves. Her kitchen had 50 of everything — spoons, forks, knives, bowls, plates, cups, wine glasses — and with these abundant apparatuses, she had delicately prepared an exquisite dish of spaghetti Bolognese to welcome me. When I saw the steaming plate on the table, my excitement extinguished in a snap. Red meat, olive oil and carb-heavy spaghetti — it was three evils in one, all teaming up on me to corrupt my regimen. Nevertheless, I knew that sharing the meal was the right thing to do. I pushed aside my thoughts and got to know my host mother over our plates. Her warmth made me feel welcome and comfortable, and my anxiety about the food began to slip away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my first few weeks, each meal felt like a mountain to be scaled. Yet, after reaching the summit and laying my cutlery aside my plate, I felt not accomplishment, but guilt. However, over time, I learned to enjoy the view. The creaminess of warm-buttered purée, the tantalizing juices of duck confit and the heavy richness of quiche Lorraine … These are all plates that I never would have dreamed of tasting before studying abroad but now cannot imagine my experience without. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I enjoyed the new flavors and began to seek out more. After hearing that France’s best-rated viennoiserie was situated in Bordeaux, I eagerly took a special trip downtown to sample its chocolatine. On a weekend trip to Lyon, France’s gastronomic capital, I eagerly tasted the buttery culinary specialty of foie gras. Throughout my study abroad experience I sampled canel</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">és, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the classic Bordelaise pastry flavored with rum and vanilla, from multiple shops, in order to discover the best one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My newfound joy for food spilled over into other facets of my life. I rediscovered interests which had been so long ignored while I was carefully counting the cherry tomatoes on my salad and logging them into my calorie-counting app. I now had the time to create things and started writing a blog about my study abroad adventures. I went out to bars with friends and ordered the drinks that looked appealing to me — even if they were made with non-diet tonic water! I spent lazy Saturday mornings reading poetry in my sunlit living room, fidget-free and entirely content. I finally saw the value in a life centered around the pursuit of joy instead of a quest to fit into double zero jeans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on the past four months, I am astounded at how much I’ve changed. Living with a French host family incentivized me to stray from my “perfectly clean diet” in order to create true familial connections. Being surrounded by a gastronomy-centered society prompted me to let down my guard surrounding food in order to experience its cultural beauty in entirety. Thus, studying abroad gave me more than just change of scenery; it also allowed me a change in the way I view my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d be lying if I said that my conscience doesn’t sometimes flicker when I take a bite of chocolate cake. But the relics of my past mentality never trump my newfound desire to engage in life’s pleasures. I love food, as well as the countless lessons and connections that it can bring. Thus, I have no reservations swallowing my rules in order</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to fully digest life.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein seeks to inspire anyone and everyone to experiment with new flavors.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.
