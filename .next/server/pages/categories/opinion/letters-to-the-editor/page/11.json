Whether it be information about increasing student fees, cuts to classes, cuts to administrative services, or the way in which the money we pay for our education is used by our institution. This is vital stuff that most of us do not have the time to investigate on our own, which is why the existence of independent media is such a necessity. One such example of independent media is <em>The Bottom Line</em>, which serves the UCSB community through its unbiased and informed investigative journalism. As an independent form of media on campus, it provides us students the information we want to know without being tied to advertisers or commercial interests.</p>\n<p><em>The Bottom Line</em> currently survives on an ever-slim budget, which has consistently dwindled as our public school system has had to make budget cuts. In the face of this it seeks to remain a truly independent paper, funded by those who need its information the most: UCSB students and it does not want to be held by outside interests. A similar independent media source on campus, KCSB-FM 91.9, remains independent through a student lock-in and community member donations.</p>\n<p><em>The Bottom Line</em> seeks $1.69 from each student a quarter, which is less than most of us pay for a small cup of coffee. Moreover, <em>The Bottom Line</em> deserves consistent funding so that it can continue to grow into something bigger and better, to reach its full potential. Not only does The Bottom Line provide students a rare chance to get involved directly with the media and to delve into very important student issues but it is the type of entity public universities need to have; a medium that is constantly analyzing and questioning and seeking out answers for its community.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Independent media must be fought for and sustained on our campus. <em>The Bottom Line</em> provides us students with the critical analysis we cannot do alone.

While standing in support of healthy dialogue as a learning process, we as the 2012-13 A.S. Executive Officers have decided to submit comment with respect to A.S. matters in pursuit of providing correct information to students.</p>\n<p>What follows includes responses to assertions made regarding the capacities of A.S. process and personnel, our shared concerns that we have been obligated to address together this year and, for the first time in A.S. history, a collective endorsement across party lines of the presidential candidate we believe most qualified to continue addressing such concerns, all of which we feel compelled to vocalize amongst a sea of rhetoric.</p>\n<p>In terms of student fees and all other money students put into the university, fees paid quarterly to Associated Students are not part of the academic tuition you pay each quarter. A.S. fees are directed to A.S. and include services across a wide spectrum, while tuition is directed to the University of California. Therefore, a reduction in âstudent feesâ (fees that go to A.S.) does not constitute a reduction in tuition. In fact, a reduction in student fees limits the availability of services. The only time fees can be reclaimed is when an individual deems that a specific A.S.-sponsored activity has contradicted the individualâs ideological/political/religious beliefs, and the individual completes the paperwork necessary to reclaim the fees he or she contributed to that specific activity, per Smith v. Regents. The amount of return an individual may receive rarely exceeds six cents historically and is usually designated based on specific events. The notion of returning âunusedâ student fees to individual students at the close of the academic year is not a viable possibility. We want to make clear that referenda dollars voted on by the students is a rare moment when students actually have a say in where their fees are going, especially compared to the Universityâs past negligence in terms of making your tuition distribution transparent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The accusation of âcorruptionâ within the Executive Board was related to the tuition assistance that A.S. executives receive, which this Executive Board, for the first time ever, advocated to cut such honoraria â making it the only board to do so and puts action behind words. Such accusation, we believe, is damaging and based on misinformation that does more harm than good to students. Tuition assistance for A.S. execs is meant to retain the A.S. values of accessibility and inclusivity by preserving the opportunity to serve in exec positions to be available to all students regardless of socioeconomic backgrounds. As the result of economic realities and the time-intensive nature (40+ hours per week) of executive positions, some students would not have the ability or time to balance a part-time job and hold an exec position were it not for tuition assistance. In addition, many students are not able to serve as elected officers not because they are not qualified but because they do not have the economic privilege to do so, especially in light of increasingly burdensome tuition.</p>\n<p>To ensure accountability, A.S. already has checks and control points in place for addressing and adjudicating internal matters of corruption or frivolous spending. These mechanisms take the form of Judicial Council, Senate ratification and advice available from A.S. staff, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we would like to take corrective action with respect to an incident that occurred this year involving the misuse of Associated Students resources for personal and academic purpose. Toward the end of November, a student that was not elected or appointed impermissibly used the A.S. name in an effort to collect data for a class project. This effort constitutes false pretenses, fabrication of an A.S. committee and the subsequent deception of the entire undergraduate and graduate student population at UCSB. In response to this incident, and in an attempt to ensure this type of abuse never occurs again, the A.S. Executive Officers chose to endorse the only candidate for A.S. President that, in our collective opinion, demonstrates the integrity and trustworthiness that is vital to fulfilling the mission of Associated Students: Megan Foronda. However, this decision ultimately rests with the student body.</p>\n<p>Foronda has proved her thorough knowledge of the internal processes of A.S. and has extensive experience uniting, rather than dividing, students. She understands the power of student voices and listens to their concerns, breaking away from the exclusive nature that A.S. seems to take when individuals focus on themselves and pursue their own agenda. Megan has always supported a wide variety of students, whether that be through allocating resources toward a diverse array of events or being the only presidential candidate that has substantially planned and organized large-scale events and spaces in which students can critically discuss relevant issues at the university, especially those that critique Associated Students. She has also been involved in effectively teaching students about the California budget crisis in relation to the privatization of higher education which, in a climate of constant attack on affordability of tuition, is ever-important.</p>\n<p>As the elected representatives, we think it is necessary to bring a healthy dose of constructive criticism, desperately needed for a governing body often marred by party politics and rhetoric that clutters the Association with negativity, hostility and discomfort. We, as individuals from all parties and nonpartisan backgrounds, felt it necessary to convey facts to the student body amidst quite a bit of misinformation out there.</p>\n<p>Associated Students is more than elections, and elected representatives are only a portion of what A.S. has to offer. The President, as the Chief Executive Officer of Associated Students, is your official representative on campus, systemwide, local, state and federal matters, which only increases the need for a president with a solid plan and a demonstrated ability to effectively and responsibly use resources. In short, Megan Foronda is the only presidential candidate that resembles this type of leader and the goals, aspirations and integrity Associated Students needs.</p>\n<p>It is our sincerest hope that you continue to remain critical of your elected student officials and engage in healthy, open and honest dialogue regarding issues that pertain to you. Whomever you vote for, we hope you vote and question information being presented to you. We thank you for your thoughtful consideration in reading this message and wish you a truly enjoyable Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><em>The Executive Officers have all decided to endorse individually, and our titles are used for identification purposes only.</em></p>\n<h5></h5>\n<h5>A version of this letter appeared on page 16 of the April 25, 2013 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h5>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/a-s-officers-band-together-back-foronda-as-president/","id":5957,"author":{"id":471,"name":"Multiple Authors"},"related":[5956,5955,5954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bitcoin: All That Glitters Isnât Always Gold","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","description":"On Monday, I accidentally showed up around thirty minutes early to my 12:30 p.m. history class.

The time was just short enough to force me to stay in Phelps Hall, but not long enough to do anything. So I decided to do the usual and crack out my laptop to browse Facebook and Reddit.</p>\n<p>It was pretty much the usual. Friends uploading new pictures, lame memes reposted from Reddit and chuckles about North Koreaâs bullshit, but something caught my eye. A thread on /r/economics mentioned Bitcoin, a new all-digital currency championed by libertarians and Tea Partiers as being the digital alternative to the gold standard. This wasnât the first time I had heard about it â back in February, my friend tried to get me to buy into it when it was still around $2 per digital coin. I didnât. I thought it was a bubble then, and I know itâs a bubble now. But curiosity got the best of me, and I just had to check the exchange rate to see if I was right.</p>\n<p>âHoly fucking shit!â I nearly jumped out of my seat. I was right, but inconveniently so. Back in February, my friend had tried to suggest that I invest around $500 to buy around 250 in shares, priced at $2. Had I done that, I would now be sitting on 250 shares of Bitcoin now valued at $236, or around $59,000 in estimated worth. âHoly fucking shitâ is right.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Back to Facebook, my friendâs News Feed lit up like the Fourth of July, proclaiming the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, and heralding it as the future of digital currency. My cries of warning and temperance went unheeded as he gleefully listed off the soaring price. $175. $185. $231!</p>\n<p>The reason why it was so high was because it was a speculative bubble. Bitcoin was marketed as an alternative to the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro, as being a hard currency that can be used to barter for goods. The advantage is that it is completely free from any central banking monetary policy, so it can increase and decrease at will. This makes it the worldâs first universal investing currency to avoid the drags and pitfalls of inflationary and deflationary cycles brought upon by fluctuations in the money supply. Or at least thatâs what Bitcoin would have you believe.</p>\n<p>In the opinion of this writer, itâs just a hoax, and Iâm not in bad company. Jim Cramer of âMad Money,â financial analyst Felix Salmon and even Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman had less than stellar things to say about Bitcoin, with Cramer even rejecting it as a currency at all.</p>\n<p>To even be considered a currency, Bitcoin would have had to have been accepted as a medium of exchange, but barring a few examples, virtually no one has done so. Instead, it was quite rapidly identified as a potential bubble by market speculators. They simply wanted to buy enough shares at a low enough price, hoping that some poor sap would buy a few several months down the road at a grossly inflated price. Think of it like buying tickets to the ball game playoffs before the season starts. If your team makes it to the playoffs, you can sell the tickets for a handsome profit. If they donât, then youâre shit out of luck, unless you can offload it to some poor sap before that. And thatâs exactly whatâs happening to Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The value of Bitcoin peaked last night at around $260 before falling to $105. In a move that is echoing the housing bubble of 2007-2008, it is slowly climbing back up again, as the âtrue believersâ are in complete denial of Bitcoinâs impending doom. On Redditâs /r/Bitcoin subreddit, thereâs a thread with 755 upvotes titled âHold Spartans!â with a link to a Photoshopped image of Spartan phalangites sporting Bitcoin shields.</p>\n<p>Back to Facebook, I replied about an hour ago to my friendâs thread. He responded, âCrashed??? Time to buy, buy, buy!â âNoâ¦ dude,â I chimed back in, âWeâre at the first bull trap, and youâre in denial. Sell now, recoup your principle, or get wiped out.â But before I could finish, he replied, âItâs just a bump, not a crash.â</p>\n<p>I doubt that. But it hasnât stopped people dumping tons of cash into the market, with some even selling their houses to get the requisite cash to invest. I just now have to meditate on the consequences of my action or inaction. On the one hand, I quite clearly didnât make $59,000, but on the other hand, I didnât participate in a predatory market strategy.</p>\n<p><em>Kevin de Bree is a third-year history majorâ¦ and was almost a $59,000-iare.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

It is a pro US-Israel relations group that aims to promote and strengthen the bond between the United States and Israel. Through our involvement in pro-Israel politics, we interact with key political figures, build strong relationships and ultimately help influence policy-makers both in the present and for the future.</p>\n<p>Along with other members of Gauchos for Israel, I was privileged to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committeeâs (AIPAC) three-day Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. which hosts 13,000 participants including 2000 students from all fifty states. I returned feeling not only more educated but also truly inspired to act.</p>\n<p>The convention offered a plethora of opportunities to hear distinguished speakers and attend breakout sessions that facilitated panel discussions. I was humbled by words of esteemed political leaders such as Senator John McCain, Israelâs Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Israelâs Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, Vice President Joe Biden and even Israelâs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via live video satellite). The breakout sessions were informational seminars led by experts in the field covering a variety of issues regarding the relationship between the United States and Middle Eastern nations.

Regardless of Iranâs failing economy, they still remain persistent in their efforts. The United States has realized that this is not only a key problem to the State of Israel, but it also poses a security threat to the U.S. as well. In response, the Obama administration is currently implementing strict sanctions on Iran, most recently a unilateral trade sanction, H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013.</p>\n<p>Honorable Daniel Glaser, Assistant Secretary for terrorist financing in the United States Department of the Treasury, explained that this would target Iranâs ability to access the international finance system. Any country purchasing oil from Iran must now pay in its own currency, and Iran is no longer allowed to exchange this currency for its own. In addition, sanctions from the U.S. are threatened for any country that deals directly with the Iranian bank. The H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was passed on February 6, 2013, and will have a huge impact on Iranâs already damaged economy.</p>\n<p>Even though many point to Iranâs evasion of sanctions through loopholes, Glaser reassured that the intelligence office is maintaining a close watch on Iran. Congress is also debating alternative options such as a viable military threat. Once Iran obtains nuclear capabilities, there is no reverting the fact that they could produce an atomic bomb at any given moment.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel must work together to do all that is possible to prevent this precarious situation from confronting the international arena. Having studied abroad in Israel for four months, I feel that this issue not only affects Israeli citizens, but the American general public as well. As an American citizen, I deeply believe in the importance of a strong and united front against a potentially nuclear capable Iran.</p>\n<p>This conference as a whole made me realize how supportive the United States truly is toward its relationship with Israel. Hearing political leaders speak of their reliance on Israel and vice versa was incredibly empowering. I feel proud as an American to be helping to contribute to the safety of not only the citizens of Israel, but the security of the United States as well. I strongly believe that the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong, and will only continue to strengthen in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Ariel Brotman is a third-year psychology and Middle East studies Major.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50695\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50695\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/","id":5970,"author":{"id":488,"name":"Abriel Brotman"},"related":[5969,5968,5967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New âCAUCUSâ Group Focuses on Unity between UC/CSU/CC Students, Aims for Empowerment","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Â  The three tiers of education in California have acted independently of one another since their very creation.

Every CC, CSU, and UC has had their own slate of issues laid down and divided by the stateâs board of education. Most of us are familiar with the UCâs plight of regental reform, tax hikes, and shrinking of financial aid vouchers. However, looking at the broader picture of issues staring down at the CSU and CC calls to question how some issues may be shared. Proposition 30, being the partial bandage of the entire California higher-education system was aimed to be shared among the three separate bodies.</p>\n<p>CSUâs focused these funds on increasing technology usage, enhancing outreach programs, and stopping unwanted tuition spikes. With the Prop 30 awarding a safety net of $125 million to the Cal State budget, students will be temporarily refunded by tuition waivers. However, the Cal State system will not be able to avoid making faculty and administration cuts to further balance their budget. CCâs are battling with class overflow, availability, faculty ratio, and a recently introduced course drop fee.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The resemblance of budgetary reform and fiscal responsibility among state legislators has been called to question numerous times. Student advocates have marched together and have called out the state on many occasions. Yet, apart from the âMarch in March,â there has not been collaboration in any organized fashion to help represent the three tiers of education in our state. This call to question has been recognized but no formal action has been taken until last year. I am a transfer student from both a CC and Four Year Institution. I have felt first-hand the dissemblance and fracture of the CA students on the ground level. I decided to bring this to the UCSAâs attention and pitch it as a formal endorsable resolution at the summer conference in 2012. It turned out that a few of my colleagues at UCR and UCLA had the exact same idea. After discussing the idea further, we decided to create a formal union of college students similar to the structure of the UCSA. However, this new organization would involve student leaders from all tiers of education in CA. We got the idea at the conference to title the organization (C.A.U.C.U.S.), which stands for the California Union of College and University Students. This union would call representatives from each assembly district to send a student leader from that region. Since there are more CCâs and CSUâs than UCâs the organization is going to extend to every region that may not include UCâs. In addition to these representatives, there are special delegate liaison from the SSCCC, CSSA, and UCSA. With a diverse and widespread board of representatives tackling issues of commonality can be objective to the needs of all students in the CA education system.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Senator Jackson, Assemblyman Williams, and many other representative allies we have a solid âYES,â to continue building this CA Student Union. At this point we are looking for feedback, advocates, and motivators to help make this idea into reality. I am pretty curious as to what my fellow Gauchos think about this, (as we are the most spirited campus that drives the UC.) Regardless of how long this takes I promise that this will happen. There is always a better chance to fight for what students believe in when we stand together. The choice is oursâ¦.</p>\n<p>STAND UNITED OR FALL DIVIDED!</p>\n<p><em>Sam Swift is a third-year political science and acting double major.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at<em> dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/","id":5964,"author":{"id":487,"name":"Sam Swift"},"related":[5963,5962,5961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cyberspace Classrooms and E-Professors: One Laptop Learner Considers the Merits and Downfalls of Online Classes","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB has recently begun to experiment with teaching online classes.

Many parts of the traditional face-to-face lecture class work well online, but some do not. Knowing the difference between when the web works and when it doesnât is the only way the university can teach online classes without eroding the quality of education.</p>\n<p>One place the web shines is in its replacement of the traditional lecture. Lectures are often one-way, with the professor disseminating information to the students. There is no reason this information broadcasting canât be moved online. Some on-campus professors make their classes interactive by inserting questions to check the studentâs understanding, often with i&gt;Clickers. This can be done online as well. I took a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), a course delivered simultaneously to tens of thousands of students from the University of Michigan, and in this class, most of the lectures had integrated multiple-choice questions into the lesson. Because the web can replace the traditional lecture, courses like MOOCs are made possible. It also allows lectures from the best speakers to be disseminated widely.</p>\n<p>The online lecture format is different from the traditional lecture format and has some unique requirements. It is very important that online lectures are videos. There is much more to a lecture than a professorâs words or even the sound of his/her voice; body language conveys a lot, and movement of any sort (be it a video of the professor or video of a whiteboard) lends visual interest and helps keep the students engaged. Also, with the number of distractions available on the computer, it is very easy to lose interest in the class without ever intending to. To these ends, lectures need to be broken up into separate chunks timed at less than 20 minutes each that build on each other, with each containing a single big idea.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the wonderful things about online classes is that they are easy to fit into a busy schedule. Itâs OK to stop after any video and return later. Formatting the class this way allows people not only to fit the videos into their schedules but also allows people to easily find the video on a specific topic if they wish to review it later.</p>\n<p>So the lecture is easily moved online. Thatâs great! But there is a lot more to a university class than the lecture. One of the goals of a university, and especially a research university like UCSB, is to create a community of scholars. This requires not only interaction between the students and the instructors but also unstructured time between professors and students in which they can ask questions too esoteric or off-topic for a general class discussion. Theoretically, this could be done online, but I have yet to find a more productive way to communicate with faculty than meeting in person. Many online classes have discussion forums, but these have a disadvantage because there is a significant time lag in posing a question, receiving a response, posing a follow-on question and so on. Real-time electronic communication technologies could potentially change this, but, as Jane Jacobs observed in 1957, âperson-to-person (even with video added) is no substitute for face-to-face.â This is still true today.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy understands this very well. They are promoting a model in which video lectures occur online, and students do exercises in class where they can receive help from their instructors. This âflipped classroomâ approach takes full advantage of the strengths of the web to disseminate information without losing the critical person-to-person aspect of education.</p>\n<p>I took Geography 12: Maps and Spatial Reasoning online at UCSB in the fall. The class was well-done. The instructor as well as the TAs had open office hours each week. There was also an on-campus section. Many of the activities in section could have been moved online, but this is something that must be decided on a class-by-class basis.</p>\n<p>In general, online classes need to be made up of engaging videos to replace the traditional lecture, and we must remember that there is more to a university class than the lecture. We need to address all these things in order to perpetuate the mission of creating a community of scholars. Otherwise, we are shorting both the students and the university.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Conway is a third-year geography major.

For those first two years, they get to bask in the infamous college social life and are not as pressured with the impending doom that awaits those who transfer into the university.

This leads to difficulties involved in balancing a strong social life and maintaining a good GPA.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving to UCSB, transfer students start at the beginning in terms of their transcripts, meaning that their GPA is, essentially, zero. Within one quarter, a student struggling to adapt to the quarter system and their new living situation might falter in their academics and earn a 2.70 GPA or lower.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This grade decline comes with many complications for the following few quarters; many of these transfer students will not get accepted in their major, and their GPAs are so low that getting a research position is nearly impossible. In the following quarter, students must fight to raise their GPA with the remaining pre-major courses, or else they will be forced to either change their major or drop out of UCSB, leaving them lost and unsure how to pursue a promising future.</p>\n<p>The struggle with finding a research position is not unique to transfer students with low GPAs. In fact, it is an issue for transfer students in general because most research teams require that a student attend at least two on-campus quarters, excluding summer. In the competition for a reputable resume and background in research, students must wait until after their first two quarters to apply for research positions.</p>\n<p>Since most teams are looking for applicants during the beginning of the school year, this is a real problem for transfer students. That being the case, students are left waiting until their fourth year often to gain laboratory experience, which leaves them with only one year to get the training they need to apply and appeal to graduate schools.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are alternative opportunities for prospective students. Transfer students have the option to apply as volunteers on a research site. Though they may not get course credit for their contribution, they will still get recognizable hands-on experience to present on their resume.</p>\n<p><em>Mai-Lynn Tran is third-year psychology major.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, March 1, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/transfer-woes-a-word-to-the-wise-transfer-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/transfer-woes-a-word-to-the-wise-transfer-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/transfer-woes-a-word-to-the-wise-transfer-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/transfer-woes-a-word-to-the-wise-transfer-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/transfer-woes-a-word-to-the-wise-transfer-student/","id":5962,"author":{"id":485,"name":"Mai-Lynn Tran"},"related":[5961,5960,5959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From Drone Strike Policy to Campus Rape Awareness Campaigns: Musings on Male Culpability in the 21st Century","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Â  On Tuesday, Feb. 19, two Nexus articles caught my eye.

U.S. policy lists young men as combatants. Imagine, if you will, what would happen if it were to become known that U.S. policy called for killing women of military age. People would riot in the streets and drone strikes would be halted tomorrow.</p>\n<p>What does the drone example teach us? Men are warriors and men are disposable. Even in 2013, we are still expected to die in wars. Just as the Selective Service Act requires all American young men to register for the draft, Pakistani young men are indirectly âdraftedâ by our foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Drone policy also reveals our societyâs presumption of male culpability. Men are guilty. This presumption is the reason why men receive longer prison sentences for the same crimes. It is why black men in the Jim Crow South could be lynched based solely on a white womanâs accusation of rape. It is why we can ignore male domestic violence victims, and dismiss male victims of crime by saying that âmen committed the violence.â (Would we dare say the same thing about minorities or the poor?) And this ties into the second article, the one concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Just as young Pakistani men are seen as terrorists, young American men are seen as rapists. Of course, sexual violence is a very serious problem, and I do not believe that the people who are trying to stop it have anything other than the noblest intentions. But I worry that they may be doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, the signs by the bike paths â the âexcusesâ used to justify rape. What exactly do these signs hope to accomplish? What good will it do to remind students of rape every day while biking to class? I doubt the signs will stop a single sexual assault, but they will constantly remind female students of their supposed vulnerability and powerlessness â while at the same time wagging a finger at male students, reminding us of our potential violence and criminality.</p>\n<p>The article says that the signs are meant to âopen up conversation on sexual violence,â so allow me to add an alternate perspective to the conversation. Do with it what you will.</p>\n<p>One sign says, âShe said no but meant yes.â The problem is, a 1988 study by Texas A&amp;M University found that 39.3 percent of college women had at some point said ânoâ when they meant âyes.â Another excuse reads, âWe were both so drunk.â This one is even more problematic; if we extend the definition of rape to include consensual sex while drunk, then I suspect the majority of Isla Vistans are guilty. And what if both the man and woman are drunk? Do they simultaneously rape each other? If the woman is not responsible for her actions while drunk, why should the man be? And, most importantly, does the woman feel raped? In many cases of consensual drunk sex, I would suspect that the answer is no.</p>\n<p>In the words of Dr. Warren Farrell, âLaws against date rape with broad definitions are like 55-mile-per-hour speed limits â by making everyone a violator, they trivialize those who are real violators.â</p>\n<p>American men do not live in the shadow of drones, but the principle is the same. We are the guilty ones. At the dawn of the 21st century, we live under a burden of original sin more subtle than anything the Church ever concocted.</p>\n<p><em>Jason Garshfield is a first-year undeclared major.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h6>The article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on Monday, February 25, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/","id":5961,"author":{"id":453,"name":"Jason Garshfield"},"related":[5960,5959,5958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Pains of Political Correctness","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As students of a generally left-wing Southern California university, we are fortunate enough to form part of a culture that preaches tolerance and diversity.

While I do not wish to decry the value of such ideals, I wish to point out that they are just what their name denotes â ideals. Let it be clear that the aim of my criticism is against the notion of political correctness, which I consider both aggressive and futile, not tolerant, which is of course a noble aspiration.</p>\n<p>It is a well-known principle of optimism that we cannot change the world around us, only our response to it. If he is wise, the happy individual does not believe the world is flawless, but instead controls his reaction to the flaws all around. This is the crux of my argument against PC culture. Human beings are naturally hostile and limited in perspective; as such, racism, sexism and homophobia are unfortunate inevitabilities of life. Struggle as we might against them, there is no possible eradication of these ugly externalities. What is in our power, however, is the degree to which we allow them to affect our well-being. If we resolve to feel nothing at the hateful words of others, we walk through life with an impenetrable shield as a result of inner strength. Why allow such ignorance to affect us so? It is fruitless.</p>\n<p>Advocates of political correctness harp on the importance of using the appropriate terminology. Womyn, LGBTQIA, and so on ad nauseam (there have probably been more letters added to this acronym as you read this; God lend us all the strength to keep up). As with money, political structures and a myriad of other convoluted things, language is a manmade construct that we have allowed to enslave us. The nature of linguistics is an arbitrary one; no word innately means anything other than what it has been assigned by society. This realization is empowering. Rather than fear slurs and obscenities, drain them of their power. Reclaim the words that offend you by using and repeating them until they are meaningless. Banning them from speech only reaffirms the strength and hatred behind them. Furthermore, forcibly altering someoneâs words does not necessarily guarantee any change in their thoughts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But perhaps all of this comes across as rather heavy handed and callous. Isnât it our duty as tolerant people to illuminate the minds of others and serve as harbingers of progress? The Law of Aggression, a central tenet in Taoism, holds that force defeats itself â that inert objects, once tampered with, begin to resist. When PC culture is adamantly in my face, I feel so imposed upon that I want to hurl obscenities every which way, even though Iâm a gay liberal atheist. Change comes from within. We cannot force tolerance. If you yourself are educated, that is enough. Rather than squandering time fixing the speech of everyone else, let us merely fix our own perspectives.</p>\n<p>We live in a desolate world filled with boundless ignorance and hatred. It cannot be eradicated â only mitigated, slightly, through endless toil. And so I leave you with a piece of bleak but necessary advice, which may appear as nihilism but is in fact a resignation that will prove replenishing in the long term: Do not weary yourself. Abandon your ideals. In what pristine dimension will they materialize?</p>\n<p><em>Navid Ebrahimzadeh is a fourth-year CCS literature major.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

The divestment campaign, set forth by Bill McKibbenâs 350.org, is one of many campaigns aimed at combating climate change. However, with an estimated total university endowment of $400 billion and more than 210 universities participating, the campaign has the potential to be one of the most impactful yet.</p>\n<p>In 1970, University of California Santa Barbara students, in protest to the Vietnam War and the 1969 Union Oil Spill in the Santa Barbara Channel, burned down the Bank of America located where Embarcadero Hall now stands. In recent years our student body has protested tuition hikes, the Iraq War and taken part in the Occupy movement, along with other campaigns for sustainable âgreenâ energy.</p>\n<p>As a student at UCSB, I feel empowered that the student body I am a part of is so committed to exercising its voice. However, while other universities like Unity College in Maine and Hampshire College in Massachusetts have already agreed to studentsâ demands to divest in fossil fuel companies, UCSB seems to be lagging on the issue. I find this surprising for a school that is so active on political issues. While our Environmental Awareness Board is working on a divestment campaign, it seems that many students are unaware of the issue entirely. Perhaps the novelty of the issue is the cause of this, or perhaps people outside of my own Environmental Studies major are just less concerned. Whatever the reason, this needs to change.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At a recent stop to Middlebury College, as part of Bill McKibbenâs âDo the Mathâ tour, McKibben made the case for divestment in fossil fuels and a student-driven change explaining that, âIt makes no moral or practical sense to pay for the education of Middlebury students by investing in companies whose business plans guarantee they will not have a planet to enact that education on.â As students we have a vested interest in the future of the Earth and the climate that surrounds us. To echo Bill McKibben, what good is the work we do today if we will not have an Earth to call home in our near future? When you are lucky enough to see the ocean everyday on your way to class, it is sometimes difficult to envision the devastation that is being exacted on the environment each day. However, in order to secure our future, we must address these issues now, and the divestment campaign is the perfect opportunity to make a difference.</p>\n<p>The Nation wrote that the divestment campaign was âengaging more students than any similar campaign in the last 20 years.â As the progressive university that we are, we must take up this fight to rid oil companiesâ stocks of our support. This is our battle. It is our generation that will inevitably inherit a world affected by the consequences of climate change. It is thus a logical result that we should take the leading role in shaping the political agenda toward a more secure future. We have seen the ineffectiveness of politicians in the fight against climate change, and why should they care? They have no stake in the issue. The issue of climate change is not dissimilar to those of gay marriage, abortion, black rights or any other issue that has been voted on by those who have no stake in the matter.</p>\n<p>Does it make sense to continuously allow the majority to make decisions about minorities? Because that is what has been the case in the past, and it is almost always slow to create positive change. Despite years of the top scientists and economists pressuring politicians about the environment, little has been done. It is clear that money has the largest voice in Washington, and a $400 billion nationwide university endowment makes quite a ruckus. Finally students have found an angle into the debate. With combined UC assets totaling upwards of $74 billion, UC divestment will not only make a statement to the oil companies that will lose our schoolsâ investments, but also to the politicians who have done so little to enhance our future livelihood thus far.</p>\n<p>As the educated individuals that we are, one could only hope that UCSB can come together and make a difference as we have countless times in the past. The power has finally made its way into the right hands; it is up to us to decide how to wield it.</p>\n<p><em>Eli Arata-Reshes is a third-year environmental studies and economics double major.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

At the UC level, we have much to be proud of as well:</p>\n<p>According to the UC Sustainability Reports, as of 2012 the UC campuses could produce over 17 megawatts of onsite renewable power â wow! Plus, the UC has the most LEED (green building) certifications of any university in the U.S. It is great that our university is making huge ecological improvements. But how can the UC claim to be a leader in sustainable business when it buys stock in fossil fuel companies?</p>\n<p>From their extraction to their combustion, fossil fuels are an energy source brimming with pollution. As most of us already know, coal burning causes acid rain, oil spills poison our rivers and âfrackingâ rock to extract natural gas requires huge volumes of chemical-laden water. Moreover, fossil fuel combustion is contributing to global climate change by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>It is likely a fiscally-smart investment to own stock in the lucrative fossil fuel industry, but because fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, this is an investment in favor of global climate change, and climate change is truly a ârisky business.â</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, global climate change is causing rising sea levels, melting glaciers, changing precipitation patterns and more frequent and intense weather patterns. These alterations to the planet, which are effects of global climate change, compromise our safety and that of future generations. For example, changing precipitation patterns mean that we are experiencing increasingly frequent and intense floods which drown people, destroy homes and create breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Climate change therefore reduces the ability of future generations to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>Obviously, climate change is not something in which an aspiring sustainable institution should be invested. Burning fossil fuels is a cause of global climate change, so it is equally inappropriate for the sustainability-oriented UC to own stock in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>UC Students have the power to change the Regentsâ investments. Today, we need to pressure our Regents to uphold the UC-wide mission of sustainability by demanding that they divest from the fossil fuel industry. Itâs time to take action. Attend an Environmental Affairs Board meeting (Wednesdays, 7 p.m. in the MCC) to get started!</p>\n<p><em>Risa Jensen is an undeclared first-year.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/","id":5965,"author":{"id":482,"name":"Risa Jensen"},"related":[5964,5963,5962],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Come One, Come All!

If you want to live in the University-owned Residence Halls, do it (they are currently accepting contracts for Manzanita and San Rafael for all continuing students!). If you cannot afford a particular place, but your group is pushing you to sign the lease, find the strength to tell them the truth. Either assist in finding a more affordable alternative or find another group. If you have reservations about living with someone because you donât know them well or you suspect that you wonât be compatible as roommates, say âno thanksâ before you get stuck in a contract. It may seem awkward, but trust me; it could be much more awkward (and painful) later if you donât speak up.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>DO determine your budget ahead of time. This way you wonât sign a lease for a rental that you later realize you cannot afford. Talk to financial aid and your family (if they help support you) to see what you can afford monthly. Having a part-time job in college is great â but not if you have to work so hard to pay for rent that you have no time to study, socialize, etc. Remember that living off-campus requires more than just paying for rent â also consider the cost of the security deposit, utilities, groceries, transportation, entertainment, furniture, etc.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>DONâT think that Isla Vista is the only place for students to live. University-owned residence halls and apartments are great options. Goleta and Santa Barbara are also places to keep in mind. Although there might be a slightly longer commute to campus from Goleta or Santa Barbara, rental prices tend to be much more reasonable than Isla Vista (think: your own bedroom!) and rentals tend to be in better shape (less turnover). Plus, the bus is free and there are great bike paths! If you are interested in a rental outside of Isla Vista, keep in mind that you only need to look about 30-45 days before you want to move.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>DO make sure that you will be compatible with your potential roommates. Ask each other questions about preferences and expectations regarding cleanliness, guests, parties, studying, sleeping and anything else that you know is important to you. We have more questions available in our office. Keep in mind that a best friend does not always make the best roommate!</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>DONâT sign a contract you donât understand. Leases contain a lot of difficult language and by signing on the dotted line, you are agreeing to everything included in the lease. Bring your lease into CHO for one of our staff to read over with you and answer any questions you might have.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Do recognize that there is not a housing shortage in Isla Vista â not even close! You can even wait until summer to find a great place in Isla Vista. This November-December-January lease-signing craziness is completely unnecessary! Take your time to find a place you love, with people you can live with peacefully, at a price your bank account can handle.</p>\n<p><em>Maya Salmon is Program Coordinator for the Community Housing Office.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p><em>Never rented before?

The strongest one is the fact that Iran continues to support terrorist organizations around the globe, which could one day obtain such destructive technology from Tehran and use it against American interests â all while Iran keeps plausible deniability of being involved.</p>\n<p>Our shaky relations with Iran stem back to the 1979 Iranian revolution and ensuing Hostage Crisis, in which the U.S. embassy in Tehran was stormed and 52 American hostages were held for 444 days. This attack scarred our country and introduced us to the extremist elements inside of Iran.</p>\n<p>In 1983, Hezbollah used suicide bombers to attack the United States Embassy in Lebanon killing 63 and wounding 120. That same year Hezbollah used suicide bombers to attack the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, killing 241 Americans. In 1985, members of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad hijacked TWA flight 847, held the hostages for 3 days and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem. In 1992, Iran-backed terror groups used suicide bombers to attack the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires killing 29 and wounding 242. A 1994 attack on the AMIA building in Buenos Aires killed 85 and wounded over 300. In 1996 Iran was again linked to the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 U.S. servicemen were killed and 372 were wounded. For many years Hamas, jihadi groups and Hezbollah have indiscriminately attacked Israelâs civilian population with rockets funded and provided by Iran. The links to Iranian terror do not stop there, however.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>More recently, Iran has been tied to the deaths of countless U.S. servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan with their funding and arming of insurgents. Former United States Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell has stated, âThe Iranians today, we have clear evidence, are providing the very weapons that are causing U.S. servicemen and women to die. Thatâs clear, thatâs not refuted, thatâs not hawkish, thatâs not shaded. That is the fact.â</p>\n<p>In 2011, Iran-linked agents attempted to assassinate the Saudi Arabia Ambassador on American soil in Washington D.C. using explosives, in a plot that sounds like a movie script. Most striking of all, Iran was found to have played a role in the 9/11 attacks, by a federal district court in Manhattan in December 2011. In Havlish v. bin Laden, Judge George B. Daniels ruled that âIran and Hezbollah materially and directly supported al Qaeda in the September 11, 2001 attacks and are responsible for damages to hundreds of family members of 9/11 victims who are plaintiffs in the case.â This is quite a shocking revelation, and one which might not be known by the general public.</p>\n<p>War came to us on Sept. 11, 2001. The urge to turn our backs and leave the Middle East to take care of its own problems is not a responsible endeavor. It assumes that if we leave the world alone, the world will leave us alone. WWII taught us that real evil does exist, and that we must fight it wherever it rears its head. The Iranian people tried to rise up against their brutal, theocratic regime in 1999, in 2009 and again in 2011. Each time they were met with bullets.</p>\n<p>Our fight is not with the people of Iran, it is with the mad men who run their country. We will be challenged again as we have in the past. Will we turn our backs and hope for peace, allowing a brutal terrorist regime to acquire such a seriously destructive kind of weaponry? Or, will we harden our resolve and stand up to evil once more as we have in the past? The choice is yours.</p>\n<p><em>Avrohom Kahn is a fourth-year communication major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/concerned-student-warns-nuclear-weapons-iran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/concerned-student-warns-nuclear-weapons-iran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/concerned-student-warns-nuclear-weapons-iran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/concerned-student-warns-nuclear-weapons-iran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/concerned-student-warns-nuclear-weapons-iran/","id":5956,"author":{"id":481,"name":"Avrohom Kahn"},"related":[5955,5954,5953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alumn Pleads: âMark Massari, tear down that sign!â","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On behalf of the tens of thousands of UCSB students who transformed our Campus Events Center into one of the loudest, most raucous places to watch a college basketball game in the mid â80s through t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On behalf of the tens of thousands of UCSB students who transformed our Campus Events Center into one of the loudest, most raucous places to watch a college basketball game in the mid â80s through the late â90s, we ask UCSB Athletic Director Mark Massari to tear down the Thunderdome sign and rename the venue where Gauchos play basketball, volleyball and a host of other sports.</p>\n<p>The straw that broke the camelâs back was yet another pathetic student crowd that showed up to watch the UCSB menâs basketball team play conference rival and favorite Long Beach State in front of a live, televised audience this past Saturday. Iâve seen more energy, enthusiasm and better attendance at blood drives. The atmosphere was so bad that a TV producer found three guys sitting on surfboards off Campus Point more compelling than anything they could find in the arena. Thank god we at least have our beautiful campus and surroundings to showcase during televised games and not an empty, quiet arena.</p>\n<p>In recent years two of the greatest Gauchos ever â Orlando Johnson and James Nunnally â played in front of many similar dismal home crowds. Itâs time we stop making excuses for weak student support at basketball games. Weâve heard all the excuses: final exams, midterms, dorms closed, other things going on, blah, blah, blah. We are sick of all the excuses and empty seats! Too busy mapping out your bike route to pick up syllabi during the first week?

Sure, weâve seen a handful of great basketball crowds over the last 15 years that have shown glimpses of past glory, but we are not worthy of playing in an arena called the Thunderdome. I bet half the student body thinks that brown building on the north side of campus holds a weather simulator, rather than a place once revered as the loudest arena west of Cameron Indoor Stadium.</p>\n<p>We ask that you stop calling our beloved basketball venue the Thunderdome.

How about naming it the Val Kilmer Arena or Kirstie Alley Pavilion so as to be a reminder of past greatness falling to D-list status. Itâs hard for any older Gaucho to say our basketball team plays in a place called the Thunderdome without a little chuckle inside (actually a large chuckle inside). Seriously.

Soon to replace them and presently queued along the north face of the building is a series of palm trees, shipped in from wherever the palm tree farm is â paradise, manufactured and imported. How much has each of these wonderfully phallic pieces of decorative scenery cost the university? Probably not much, but the question is worth begging.</p>\n<p>For those who read the Nexus last week, youâll know that the UC Office of the President recently decided to retract the tasteless âlogoâ they had attempted to impose on the University, its faculty, staff and students. While much can be said about the aesthetics of the logo (its tackiness was apparent, in my opinion, for all to see) attacking it for its beauty is questionable at best. Beauty is a subjective notion, after all. Rather, what we must recognize in light of both the logo and the palm trees is the increasing commoditization of our university.</p>\n<p>In the video produced to introduce the logo, the thing itself was imposed upon a series of consumer items: a tote bag, a pair of flip flops, a coffee mug. And while a good number of us might in adulthood take our morning coffee from a cup bearing some reference to our alma mater, the idea behind the promotional video, letâs call it a commercial, equates an education at the University of California with a consumer item, something to be bought, worn around, shown off amongst our peers and then discarded at some point once its use value has dried up, holding not inherent value other than as a means to furthering ourselves in the social world, or to some other end.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The beautification that ours and other UC campuses currently experience (consider the renovations done to Berkeleyâs football stadium, far more expensive than a few trees) represents a consistent theme of commoditization, a form of marketing for the University that, while it might attract more grant money, out-of-state students (worth more than Californians) and distinguished faculty, tends to reduce the University itself to the level of a consumer item, holding no permanence or value of its own. Just as the coffee mug sits nicely in the hand of a pretty blonde woman who smiles at the person watching the video, Iâd venture to guess that the palm trees, once theyâve assimilated well enough into the campus scenery, might appear on the website, or as letterhead sent out to perspective students and faculty, a selling point on the campus tour, or whatever.</p>\n<p>The point here is not that university campuses should be dreary, lifeless and void of beauty. But while the University struggles in so many ways, while undergraduates and their parents are virtually extorted, while graduate students struggle to find funding and remain poorly compensated for all the work they do, while professors salaries remain low and endowments (particularly in the social sciences) shrink, while classrooms lack chalk and students cannot cheaply access their books, the University damns itself by investing in its outward appearance, logos, football stadiums and mass produced trees. These things are nothing but a faÃ§ade and the attention given to them detracts from what the University might otherwise be. The true value of this or any university is found in the work done, the communities built and the fostering of civic engagement. This is a place of learning, of developing ideas, establishing friendships, understanding and bettering the world, and above all, it is an end in and of itself, not a fucking postcard.</p>\n<p><em>Michael Dean asked for tuition money for Christmas and got a palm tree shoved down his chimney instead.
