More new faces, who were formerly housed but now cannot afford local rents, have also poured into their cars and our parks. We are in a crisis.</p>\n<p>People complain about panhandling and hurting businesses, but little to nothing is being done that can affect them for the long term. They cost citizens millions of dollars per year. The key is work. It builds self-worth and is not a hand out but a hand up.</p>\n<p>My team and I decided to bring a few people who have changed all this for their own city. On Thursday, Apr. 12 at 7 p.m. at the Marjorie Luke Theatre we will present two speakers; Eileen Richardson of Palo Alto and her Downtown Street Teams will share how she created jobs for the homeless population in her city. Her successful techniques have been adopted by seven other cities as well. They must be doing something right!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The other speaker will be Richard Le Mieux, author of Breakfast at Sally’s, who was a wealthy businessman who lost it all and became homeless.

Our votes don’t make a difference; nobody cares if I vote.” The thing is, guys, you’re wrong about all of it. Yes, your votes matter; yes, they do make a difference and yes, people care whether or not you vote. Who cares if students vote? Well, for one, Anna Vlahos certainly does.</p>\n<p>Last week, Ms. Vlahos, the Executive Director of Stop Voter Fraud, sent an open letter to the Santa Barbara Voter Registration Office asking them to discount voter registrations from before 2010. Sound sketchy and questionably legal? Just wait, it gets better. See, Vlahos isn’t concerned with the integrity of voter registration in Santa Barbara County as a whole — her request specifically targets UCSB and Isla Vista, citing the “transient” nature of the student population, which does sound like a reasonable argument until you actually stop to think about it.</p>\n<p>This request is just the latest in a series of attempts by this group to disenfranchise the student population in Isla Vista. The group itself was formed in support of a county supervisor candidate who lost the election three years ago and attempted to have every ballot cast in Isla Vista thrown out by accusing student groups of voter fraud. The accusations of voter fraud were roundly dismissed by every court to hear it, but that hasn’t kept Stop Voter Fraud from continuing their attempts to exclude students from the electoral process. After their efforts to throw out student votes after the 2008 election failed, it appears SVF has developed a new strategy: prevent students from voting at all in the June 5 primary. Apparently they don’t buy into the idea that everyone should have a say in government, at least not when there’s an election on the line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So, what can you do about it?

When given the option, I will choose to watch a good movie and enjoy a glass (or bottle) of red wine over walking the dirty streets of Isla Vista to search for a party. In fact, I secretly take pleasure in soberly going to the liquor store at 9 p.m. on a Friday to buy a pint of ice cream, while already-drunk frat boys and out-of-towners wait to purchase their plastic handles. Or, even better, sitting at Caje drinking a cappuccino and reading for classes until midnight on a Saturday — watching the debauchery occur outside and knowing I will wake up rested and accomplished. In short — I’m not your typical Isla Vista resident. And I love it. Studying abroad is what I imagine it feels like to be those four-day-a-week partiers in I.V. Except you’re in a foreign country. And are expected to travel a lot and do well in school.</p>\n<p>After living in Australia for three weeks without stepping foot in a classroom, semester at The University of Melbourne commenced. My days of waking up late, meeting new friends at restaurants and bars every night of the week, and posting pictures on Facebook to make my American friends jealous were over. They were replaced with 9 a.m. classes, four gigantic readers, job-hunting and going to bed at a reasonable hour. The stress I had hoped to avoid by suspending my responsibilities in the U.S. had returned, something every advisor and former student had failed to mention in our numerous pre-departure meetings.</p>\n<p>Learning that you are expected to travel in addition to living abroad only added to this pressure. It seems more innate in Europe, where you can visit many countries and experience a range of cultures in just one weekend. But travelling is also popular in Southern Australia, where heaps of natural islands and vibrant cities are easily reachable by ferry or plane. After only being in Australia for a few weeks — and still feeling like I’m on vacation — I was faced with starting the travel process all over again. Just thinking about airfares and hostels, forking over large sums of money, and coordinating friends’ diverse class schedules gave me a headache.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This realization that I was expected to travel came as I was cross-referencing the campus map to my class schedule to the best coffee shops in the area. I was just barely settling in! The homebody in me wanted nothing more than to develop a reliable routine: get involved in campus activities, master the tram system and discover my favorite bars and cafes around the city with friends. Also, I actually enjoy my classes and devote much time to reading and writing each week. Just as in Santa Barbara, people in Australia find this very strange, as most students happily blow off schoolwork to travel or hit the beach.</p>\n<p>Last weekend some friends skipped class and flew to Sydney. Other students have rented an RV and driven along the Great Ocean Road or spent a few days on the island of Tasmania. While that all sounds exotic and exciting, I can’t help wanting to settle into city life before jetting off on tropical adventures. For me, drawing lessons and drinks at a local art gallery, a rooftop cinema screening of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” and stand-up at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival sounds just right. While I eventually want to explore all Australia has to offer, the only travel research I want to do in the near future is look up the easiest walking route to class or fastest tram line downtown.</p>\n<p><em>Corie Anderson is a third-year film and media studies major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/","id":6070,"author":{"id":510,"name":"Corie Anderson"},"related":[6069,6068,6067],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Christian Voice Needs No More Representation","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I have a problem with the inclusion of a Consult a Christian column, but not because I want to suppress the Christian position in favor of championing atheist, Jewish, empiricist, Rastafarian, secular...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I have a problem with the inclusion of a Consult a Christian column, but not because I want to suppress the Christian position in favor of championing atheist, Jewish, empiricist, Rastafarian, secular, Muslim or Shinto opinions. I will argue with the Christian views and disagree with their position, but defend to my death their right to say it, so to speak. But while Christians have every right to be represented in the paper, they do not need to be. They already have a voice in the many churches in Isla Vista, the folks you find in front of the UCen or on Del Playa and if you look past Santa Barbara — a voice the size of three-quarters of the U.S. population.</p>\n<p>Much like saying heterosexual or capitalist views are underrepresented, it is ludicrous to believe that the Christian voice is being silenced. These ubiquitous viewpoints are ingrained in the fiber of our society and everyone knows them intimately regardless of their own personal beliefs. Christianity is not only the dominant religious view in our society but a full-blown institution equipped with the tools of political and social control, which affects my life whether I like it or not (I don’t, but I’ll save that for another day).</p>\n<p>I understand that you did this in response to a torrent of critical letters, but I also know that the Nexus isn’t new to the idea that you cannot accommodate all dissenting perspectives. And to accommodate a view that manifests in the vast majority of society is irresponsible and truly unbalanced. On the other hand, it’s your newspaper, and if you wish to counterbalance all of your columns irrespective of any sensibility I have some suggestions: “Go Pollution,” “They’re Doing it Right,” “Reality Hits You Soft, Girl,” “Wednesday Chastity Belt,” “Socialist Said, Libertarian Said, and Libertarian-Socialist Said.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

What do you need?” I respond.</p>\n<p>“I need some money.”</p>\n<p>“Money,” I thought.</p>\n<p>It’s a Saturday night and this person wants me to run over to the 6800 block on Sabado Tarde Road just so I can give away my money and most likely never see it again? Luckily for me, I simply didn’t have it so I had to decline — and this is what pissed me off — as soon as the person realized I didn’t have the money to give they hung up the phone immediately. No goodbye, no “by the way, awesome party, you should come by anyway,” just an abrupt click. Gone.</p>\n<p>I started to think about this person and whether they had called me for anything else other than a favor. I couldn’t remember one time, not one. I tried to remember when that person invited me out to a party with them and I couldn’t recall a single instance. I tried to remember all of the favors that person had done for me but I could only draw a blank because the memory simply wasn’t there.</p>\n<p>This made me re-evaluate my friendships in Isla Vista. I had to wonder, “Who are my real friends and who is just using me for favors?” It isn’t hard to tell who is a user and who is a true friend if one simply looks carefully. It is easy to be blinded by a nice smile and cordiality. People here are generally very good at kissing ass.</p>\n<p>Most people will act nice and sweet to your face and when you turn around they pick at your flaws like a nasty scab. Feigning sincerity in friendship is an ancient practice. There is always that person who only calls when they need a favor or that person who smiles every time they see you but if you look into their eyes as they smile, a big “fuck you” is visibly radiating from their pupils.</p>\n<p>Some people, if they don’t like you, are honorable about it and remain up front. Generally, one will know where one stands with this person. That person will either treat you like a friend or simply ignore your existence. This person is honest and most likely loyal to the friends he or she does keep.</p>\n<p>However, some people will hate you and you would never know it by the way they smile and wave. In order to tell how this person actually feels one must use all the powers of perception one possesses. Little signs and indications let you know how a person truly feels towards you. There are four questions you must ask yourself:</p>\n<p>First: When I see this person and say “hi” how long does it take them to acknowledge me and keep walking? Most of the time, when you see a good friend, you are genuinely glad to see that person and that feeling is reflected in your hello. That person looks straight at you with a warm and personal greeting. He or she will generally have something pleasant to talk to you about or maybe invite you to a party that weekend.</p>\n<p>A fake friend will pretend not to notice you at first. Then, upon noticing you, will give you a big, almost sarcastic, greeting. It is obvious when they pretend to be interested because their eyes keep drifting off to look at anything except you while they nod their head intently in agreement at whatever you say yet make little contribution to the conversation.</p>\n<p>After about a minute or so of hearing you ramble on about whatever, this person will become visibly distressed because all they want to do is leave and have thus spent the last 30 seconds trying to figure out how to successfully exit the conversation.</p>\n<p>Second: Does this person invite me to go out to parties or bars with them on the weekends? A good friend is always calling you about a party or trying to hit you up to go to Dublin’s or Gio’s. A fake friend will remain elusive about their whereabouts lest you decide to invite yourself along and they have to figure out how to say no.</p>\n<p>Next: Does this person make eye contact with me during conversation? If someone does not look you in the eye during discourse, most likely that person is not paying attention to you or the conversation. A true friend is comfortable with you and, therefore, would have zero issue looking directly at you when conversing. It is only natural to remain casual and undisturbed with a familiar face. A fake friend will avoid your eyes and become only vaguely responsive, slowly pulling back interest in hopes that you might get the hint and move on.</p>\n<p>Finally: Does this person only call me when they need something? A true friend calls you for random things like going to State Street or BevMo! to get alcohol, a party or Sharkeez or a friend’s house or to find out how you did on your midterm. A fake friend will call you for money or alcohol or drugs or to find a party if they are bored … nothing else.</p>\n<p>If you know someone that fits the description of a fake friend, do yourself a favor and avoid that person. Do not waste your time with someone who does not have enough respect to treat you with dignity. Do not waste your time with someone who cannot be honest about his or her feelings toward you. Do not waste your time with someone who sees fit to use you like a tool, without remorse, as if that is your only purpose.</p>\n<p>You know who your real friends are because those people have your back and would help you through anything. Those people are comfortable and happy with you … and you know who those people are when shit gets real because they stick around.</p>\n<p>A true friend will help you bury the body and then drive you to Mexico. A true friend would never rat you out to the cops. A true friend would never use you for favors because a true friend is there to help you if you need it and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Kelly Nassour is a third-year English major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45239\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-04/true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico-true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45239\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-04/true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico-true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-04/true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico-true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-04/true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico-true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-04/true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico-true-friend-bury-body-drive-mexico/","id":6080,"author":{"id":528,"name":"Kelly Nassour"},"related":[6079,6078,6077],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Brain Dead Drug War Policy Saves People by Killing Them”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Only people ignorant of the true history of addictive drug use blame the drugs for the tragedies connected to drug addiction.

A legal heroin habit cost less than tobacco addiction (50¢ per week) and “drug crime” was unknown. Search the historic archives in vain trying to find robberies, burglaries or assaults associated with drugs when they were legal. The term “drug crime” is an invention of prohibitionists trying to cover the effects of their failed drug policy.</p>\n<p>In the United States, unintentional opiate overdose deaths were extremely rare before drugs were outlawed. Almost all drug deaths before the Harrison Narcotic Act were suicides. Nowadays, the Drug Czar tells us there are more than 30,000 accidental drug deaths every year. The term “drug death” is an alibi to cover the deadly effects of drug prohibition. Most drug fatalities in those days were caused by suicides and a few murders, but accidental overdose deaths were exceedingly rare.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Proof that hard-line drug policies cause drug crimes and drug deaths comes from the Swiss Heroin Maintenance Program where addicts are supplied with cheap, pure heroin and cocaine. The Swiss have not had a single overdose death in the program, and injection-transmitted diseases (HIV/AIDS, Hep C, etc.) are now a rarity in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The criminal drug black market has vanished in Switzerland since the Swiss began providing addicts with cheap, legal drugs. The success of the Swiss Heroin Maintenance Program in causing a more than 97 percent reduction in addict crime in Switzerland is something drug crusaders do not want to discuss.</p>\n<p>Swiss policy has also resulted in an 82 percent decrease in heroin addiction since 1990, which is unequaled by any American drug policy.

I’d imagine that we all have experienced that awkward moment when our text message is misinterpreted or taken out of context. “But that wasn’t what I said!” “I don’t really think that!” Context is everything.</p>\n<p>That said, I would conjecture that the single most dangerous thing to both Christianity and the condemnation of Christianity is the “Bible verse”: the single quotation taken out of 66 books written over thousands of years, craftily selected to suit a specific purpose or argument. It is on Bible verses that both cults and critics thrive. If we’re going to reduce God’s Word to a sentence or two, then quite frankly, we can make it say whatever the hell we want it to.</p>\n<p>So let’s talk about condemning homosexuals to death. While we’re at it, let’s talk about those who work on the Sabbath (Exodus 31:14) and those who commit adultery (Leviticus 20:10). All condemned to death. Let me draw your attention to Jesus. He and his disciples come across the infamous “adulterous woman,” exposed in her sin and minutes from death. Jewish culture and scripture demanded that she be struck with rocks until dead. So what does Jesus do? He looks out at the crowd and says, “He who is without sin, let him throw the first stone.” And when everyone leaves, this is his final word: “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more” (John 8:1-11, ESV).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Bible, like I said, is composed of 66 books and written in three different languages over the course of thousands of years, yet it has one coherent message and focus.

In 2008 Steve Pappas lost to Doreen Farr in the race for 3rd District supervisor by 2.27 percent. He lost the student vote by more than 2:1. Citing his gut feeling that he should have gotten more votes in I.V., Pappas demanded a recount. This netted him one extra vote. Still unsatisfied, he sued to have ALL I.V. votes thrown out. Despite three years and numerous appeals, Pappas hasn’t brought forth a single shred of evidence that any voter fraud took place, and admits he cannot name a single person that he believes voted improperly. Having lost in Court four times and having his allegations dismissed by one judge as “frivolous and tantamount to an intentional misleading of the Court”, Pappas has been ordered to pay Farr’s legal fees.</p>\n<p>Bankrupting Doreen Farr was the clear primary objective of the lawsuit from the beginning. A quirk of California State law meant that as the winning candidate, Farr is responsible for defending the election in court, even though she wasn’t accused of doing anything improper. With big money developers bankrolling him, Pappas can afford to keep the lawsuit going indefinitely, and every dollar Farr spent isn’t available for her re-election campaign. This is why Pappas is appealing the $700,000 he owes Farr, to keep her cash poor for this June’s election.</p>\n<p>But there is a second and more sinister motive to the lawsuit than a simple attempt to criminalize politics and bankrupt a political opponent. Pappas v. Farr is simply one front in the right’s nationwide effort to disenfranchise young voters. Speaking to a group of young activists, former President Bill Clinton described it as “one of the most pervasive political movements going on outside Washington D.C. today is the disciplined, passionate, determined effort of Republican governors and legislators to keep most of you from voting next time […] There has never been in my lifetime, since we got rid of the poll tax and all the Jim Crow burdens on voting, the determined effort to limit the franchise that we see today.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This movement is very real. It can be seen in Florida’s new law requiring those participating in voter registration activates to register in advance with the state, which has already caused to League of Women Voters to halt their voter registration drives, and will cripple college drives. In Maine, it’s Republican Assembly Speaker O’Brien attacking students saying we “are basically doing what I did when I was a kid and foolish, voting as a liberal. They don’t have life experience and they just vote their feelings,” before attempting to stop students from voting in state elections. Just last year in Chico, students defeated Measure A, which attempted to move the City Council elections into the summer when students wouldn’t be there to vote. And it’s not going to stop. Realizing they can’t win the votes of young people the right has decided to try to bar us from voting.

Leviticus 20:10-16 contain death penalties for four different types of sexual immorality among heterosexuals, two types of sexual immorality concerning bestiality and one mention of immorality concerning homosexuals. In the same way, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 condemn not only homosexuals, but also the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, drunkards, revilers, swindlers and the greedy. Although verses 9 and 10 condemn, the following verse, 1 Corinthians 6:11, justifies stating that this is how man was while he was stuck in his sin, but now man has been washed, made clean and justified in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Does the Bible show proof that homosexual relations are a sin? Yes. The Bible has much more overwhelming proof that God loves ALL humans and will stop at nothing to provide all men with the opportunity to gain salvation, no matter their sexual orientation. Jesus Christ came to earth to save man while man was stuck in his sin. He did not give man a list of rules to achieve salvation; He put in all the work for us. In the same way, Jesus will save ALL who believe and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and was raised from the dead (Romans 10:9-11).</p>\n<p>The Bible would say that homosexual relations is the same as any other sin, condemnable by nature and that Jesus Christ provides salvation for all human beings, despite their sexual orientation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

At a Grammy pre-party, the 85-year-old addict in recovery stated: “First it was Michael Jackson, then it was Amy Winehouse and now the magnificent Whitney Houston. I’d like to have every gentleman and lady in this room commit themselves to get our government to legalize drugs.”</p>\n<p>Some point out that the problem with Bennett’s statement is that it directly links the deaths of three famous musicians to the prohibition of drugs, which isn’t exactly the case. The drugs that killed Michael Jackson and Amy Winehouse (and likely Whitney Houston if the prescription medication bottles found in her room are any indicator) were all legal. Jackson and (quite likely) Houston overdosed on prescription drugs prescribed by doctors while Winehouse died of acute alcohol intoxication.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, though legalizing currently illicit drugs wouldn’t affect the availability of prescription medication or alcohol, Bennett’s treatment for the recent rash of celebrity ODs is spot on. Jackson, Winehouse and Houston were undoubtedly all chronic drug addicts and died because of it, despite having the means to seek treatment. But considering the social stigma that relates drug use and addiction to weak willpower and poor morals, who can blame them? Society’s demonization of drug addiction prevents addicts from admitting their own problems and hinders or prevents them from seeking treatment. This is especially true for celebrities who often have all their actions in the spotlight, whether they want them to be or not.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Legalizing drugs could also help to alleviate the issue of drug overdoses by allowing recreational drug users, who prefer currently illicit drugs, access to the prescriptions they abuse to indulge in their vices. Though it seems like increasing the number of people using currently illegal drugs would increase the number of people who overdose, there are several seldom-considered factors that increase the risk associated with prescription drug abuse:</p>\n<p>1. Prescription drugs lack the taboo that illicit drugs have. Many prescription drug abusers consider it “self-medication” rather than drug abuse and addiction. This perpetuates their denial if they develop a dependency.</p>\n<p>2. Popping a pill is easier than smoking a joint or snorting a line. Many avoid recreational drugs because the route of administration often involves an unfamiliar activity like smoking, snorting, or injecting a substance. Ingesting a pill is a task that the majority of Americans have done countless times before.</p>\n<p>3. The medical industry wants to ignore the issue. Pharmaceutical companies don’t want their products to be linked to the negative social effects of addiction because it would likely decrease their profits. Doctors who over-prescribe medication have the same incentive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It isn’t hyperbolic to call prescription-drug abuse the next crack cocaine. The sale of opioids (drugs like OxyContin, Demerol and Vicodin) increased by more than sixfold between 1997 and 2006. During that same period, overdose deaths increased by a factor of 2.6.</p>\n<p>You could add more names to the list of OD’d celebs. Singer Brittany Murphy. Comedian Greg Giraldo. Playmate Anna Nicole Smith. Drummer James “The Rev” Sullivan. It’s an epidemic. And Tony Bennett’s recommendation to fight fire with fire by legalizing illicit recreational drugs may be the only way to slow it.</p>\n<p><em>David Washington is a second-year political science major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44786\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/legalization-put-rampant-overdose/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44786\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/legalization-put-rampant-overdose/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/legalization-put-rampant-overdose/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/legalization-put-rampant-overdose/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/legalization-put-rampant-overdose/","id":6078,"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington"},"related":[6077,6076,6075],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"He Said: Next Valentine’s Day, Think in Terms of What Would Whitney Do?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you, like me, spend an inordinate amount of time agonizing over the fate of divahood in American pop culture, this weekend was pretty tough on you too.

Whitney, this one’s for you. In honor of the great Mrs. Bobby Brown, I’m bringing you some Valentine’s Day advice she expressed through song.<br>\n“I Will Always Love You”: Aw, here we begin, my personal favorite Valentine’s Day group. If you find the lyrics of this song truly encapsulate your feelings on Cupid’s day, obviously last night was a pretty big deal. You’ve said that “I love you” phrase; things have probably been going on for far too long, but hey, let’s play along. Usually I like to tread along the traditional path before unleashing my inner freak, so we begin with dinner, some wine and that awkward game of footsie everyone thinks that everyone else is so into, fucking weirdos. When we get back to the lair, though, shit gets weird. Fast. Both parties shell out the obligatory “Thanks for being (insert awkward compliment or pet name here)” before the sinning begins in earnest. Simple coitus does not suffice on romance’s most holiest of days, people; we need the full spectrum; we want you to wake up the next morning truly wondering where you went so wrong in life so as to have used your tongue in that manner. I’ll spare you the trade secrets, but I think you’ve got an idea of what’s required of Whitney’s most esteemed cadre.<br>\n“How Will I Know”: Everyone is familiar with this stage in the dating game after even just a few short weeks in Dante’s second circle, commonly referred to as Isla Vista. This is that time in a relationship where you’ve been getting casually acquainted with the smell of your significant other’s morning breath. What a glorious time indeed! You’re probably feeling a bit unsure as to what is the proper course of action to take; you’re not really sure if you’re picking up what they’re putting down, but just aren’t ready to completely accept the reality of being alone in your room sniveling about “The Notebook” and its portrayal of eternal love. It’s in this situation that a little liquid courage can really open some doors. Make it takeout, grab some flowers and two-buck chuck and rehearse your lines. The mood is key; if sufficiently contrived, you could wake up the next morning finding yourself in a compassionate relationship based upon honesty and caring, or end up with deep bruising on your neck from someone apparently fresh off the “Twilight” set. The gauntlet will be thrown down whether you like it or not.<br>\n“I Wanna Dance With Somebody”: Trust me, I believe every word about how much you love being single, how you don’t need anyone to be with and how Valentine’s Day is just some stupid holiday Hallmark created to sell cards and chocolate. You’re full of shit; you know it, I know it and frankly let’s just stop pretending for everybody’s sake. Don’t worry, Whitney had you in mind when she sang, “Oh I wanna dance with somebody / I wanna feel the heat with somebody / Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody / With somebody who loves me.” For this exact reason someone throws a party every Valentine’s Day consisting of gratuitous amounts of alcohol, dubstep and a semi-attractive girl or guy with just enough life in their eyes to allow you to delude yourself into thinking they’ll remember tomorrow what happens tonight. Go ahead, let yourself go; remember, you just wanna dance with somebody. No harm in that, right?<br>\nSo if Whitney’s wisdom doesn’t suffice, consider yourself hopeless, utterly hopeless. It’s because of people like you that Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” exists in the first place. You should be ashamed.<br>\nJake Schurmeier is a fourth-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44640\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/valentines-day-terms-whitney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44640\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/valentines-day-terms-whitney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/valentines-day-terms-whitney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/valentines-day-terms-whitney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/valentines-day-terms-whitney/","id":6077,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6076,6075,6074],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Response to Ask an Atheist: The Truth About Christianity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In the article “Are Eastern religions a good alternative to Western ones?,” one of the authors, Brian Gallagher, made many assertions about Christianity that were inaccurate and misconstrued the t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the article “Are Eastern religions a good alternative to Western ones?,” one of the authors, Brian Gallagher, made many assertions about Christianity that were inaccurate and misconstrued the teachings of Christianity. Gallagher claims “In Christianity we are commanded to love … and fear, a being who … may torture us as he pleases. We are told to pray … worship … beg for forgiveness, and to imagine ourselves as … watched, judged and scrutinized.” While some of these comments are correct in that God does command certain things, the picture that Gallagher paints is incomplete. He is missing the grace aspect. Christianity is neither a religion of forced worship nor a religion of pure justice. Rather, it is a religion that man is sinful and wholly unable to fix himself but is saved by a God that is able to right the wrong and gives forgiveness to men who are utterly flawed. God calls us to love Him and to love others, a command which can only better the world if followed. This is something that comes naturally when you begin to understand the depth of His love for us. Fear of God is also something that comes easily when you ponder the awe-inspiring nature of a God that created heaven, earth, man and animal. A god that powerful is one that should be revered and respectfully feared because His power is unfathomable. Job 37:23 states “The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.”</p>\n<p>The Christian God is not a god that “tortures as he pleases,” but rather a God that loves unconditionally and “pray(ing), worship(ping) and beg(ging) for forgiveness” is how men can return that love and pursue a relationship. God’s judgment, too, is not as Gallagher described. God’s grace comes before His judgment after He has countless times extended His grace and forgiveness and we have freely made the choice to turn away from Him. Because of man’s inherent sinfulness, justice is always deserved, but mercy is given instead. This mercy was Jesus, sent to earth to pay the price for man’s past, present and future sins so that we would no longer be separate from God because of unworthiness, but could instead have a relationship. Still though, humans choose autonomy from God because human nature drives us to be selfish, hateful and egotistical; we refuse to accept that we cannot make our lives better through our own works and thus ignore the free gift of salvation. The only requirements that God places upon man are best described in the book of Micah which claims “He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.” Christianity is not a religion of judgment and malice by an uncaring god, worshipped by manipulated adherents, but rather a religion of individuals who are unworthy to have a relationship with God, but have been offered a sacrifice which enables imperfect men to approach a perfect God. The discussion of religion is an important one and should thus be factually correct when presented so individuals can get an accurate depiction of Christianity and the bigger questions in life.</p>\n<p>Emily Badraun is a fourth-year political science major.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44508\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/response-atheist-truth-christianity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44508\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/response-atheist-truth-christianity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/response-atheist-truth-christianity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/response-atheist-truth-christianity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/response-atheist-truth-christianity/","id":6076,"author":{"id":520,"name":"Emily Badraun"},"related":[6075,6074,6073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Help Give Every Child the Opportunity of an Education","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a teacher at West Charlotte High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, I taught an incredibly talented, intelligent group of ninth graders.

But when they entered my classroom on the first day of school, they were, on average, reading at a fifth-grade level. Of the 2,000 students at West Charlotte High — almost all of whom who were African American and facing the additional challenges that come along with growing up in poverty — more than half were freshman because so many had been held back. Just down the road, less than 10 miles away, was one of the highest performing schools in the state, where students saw college as the inevitable next step after graduation. For most of my students, college was a luxury they had never considered.</p>\n<p>As an undergrad at UCSB, I was very involved in the effort to expand access to the UC system for low-income students. As a first-generation college student myself, I felt strongly that affordability should never be an impediment to college attainment. But when I joined the community at West Charlotte High School, I discovered that college access is more than affordability. College access also requires college readiness built through an education that prepares students for the rigors of college-level work. My students were being shortchanged by a system that wasn’t giving them the kind of education that would put them on a path to and through college.</p>\n<p>Their story is all too common among kids growing up in low-income communities. When children growing up in poverty enter kindergarten, they are already academically behind their wealthier peers. This gap in educational opportunity only widens over time. By the fourth grade, they are three grade levels behind and half won’t graduate from high school. Only one in 10 will attend college, and for those lacking a college degree, many doors are firmly shut.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. My kids proved this to me every day. With hard work and the support of committed adults, my students were able to grow 2.5 years in just one school year. With an all-hands-on-deck approach, the achievement gap between kids growing up in poverty and their more affluent peers is a solvable problem. That’s why I joined Teach For America after graduating from UCSB in 2005. After teaching for two years, I joined Teach For America’s recruitment team so I could help more Gaucho leaders become classroom leaders, and two years later I was excited to take on my current role as executive director of Teach For America in Oklahoma. I now lead a network of more than 200 corps members and alumni who have committed to lifelong leadership in the effort to give every child — regardless of their family income — an excellent education.</p>\n<p>I can think of nothing more impactful a recent college graduate can undertake than shaping the lives of a classroom of students. They only get one shot at a good education and without a quality K-12 experience, they won’t have the option to become a Gaucho and experience a world-class UCSB education.</p>\n<p>Knowing that we can close the achievement gap, I simply can’t walk away from this work. As you think about the role you will play in the broader world upon graduation, I hope you will consider joining me in these efforts. Teach For America’s final application deadline is approaching on Feb. 10. I urge you to visit www.teachforamerica.org to learn more or start your application.</p>\n<p>Lance Tackett is a UCSB alumnus and the executive director of Teach For America in Oklahoma.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/give-child-opportunity-education-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/give-child-opportunity-education-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/give-child-opportunity-education-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/give-child-opportunity-education-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/give-child-opportunity-education-2/","id":6075,"author":{"id":519,"name":"Lance Tackett"},"related":[6074,6073,6072],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Keep Cyclists Safe While They Keep Your Gas Prices Low","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’d like to express my heartfelt thanks to Nicholas Winger, Nico Cervantes and the unidentified others who came to my aid when I crashed my bicycle during my (successful) attempt to avoid impact wit...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I’d like to express my heartfelt thanks to Nicholas Winger, Nico Cervantes and the unidentified others who came to my aid when I crashed my bicycle during my (successful) attempt to avoid impact with a vehicle driven by someone who apparently did not notice a cyclist in the bike lane.</p>\n<p>I’m grateful beyond words to live in a community where people care, and I’m also glad to be alive.

However, what strikes me most about this column is its sense of exclusivity. It’s about one thing and one thing only: heterosexuals. Heterosexual intercourse is literally only the half of sexuality. How can a column that prides itself on innovative sexual topics focus so largely on only one aspect of the trade? It is discouraging as a queer person to be continually overlooked, week after week, quarter after quarter. Granted, Elizabeth Brooks may or may not lack experience in this field, but there sure as hell are thousands of other Gauchos who could speak to homosexuality in the bedroom today. I don’t mean to degrade Brooks in any manner — she is very witty and comical in all of her publications. However, it would appear that the column has no acknowledgement or respect for homosexuality. The Nexus has never been one to ignore taboo topics. What are we so afraid of? People being “disgusted” by seeing gay sex in the Nexus? This type of bigotry and small-mindedness is hypocritical. Gay people read the vivid (yet still interesting) details of heterosexual eroticism … so why can’t the same depth be seen for homosexuals? The gay community has always struggled with visibility, and the heteronormative agenda of the Wednesday Hump continues to put us in the shadows of sexuality. I thank Brooks for all the insight she has endowed on readers each week, and I now challenge her to tackle a topic often overlooked: homosexuality. Again, it is a column I enjoy thumbing through each Wednesday, and my only wish is that it be more open to engaging a larger population of the student body.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44309\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/wednesday-hump-heternormativity-finest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44309\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/wednesday-hump-heternormativity-finest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/wednesday-hump-heternormativity-finest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/wednesday-hump-heternormativity-finest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/wednesday-hump-heternormativity-finest/","id":6071,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6070,6069,6068],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":15,"route":"/categories/opinion/letters-to-the-editor","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
