Throughout history there have been countless figures that decided they were going to get rich quick by unlawful means. At some point we have all fantasized about planning a heist with the “Ocean’s Eleven” team or being a part of a high speed chase with the guys from the movie “Heat.” Despite the grandiose nature of some of the figures in history, thefts happen much more frequently and are nowhere near as glamorous.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I was caught trying to steal a pair of headphones from the UCSB bookstore — an inexpensive pair of headphones that were 100 percent insignificant in the scope of things, but turned out to be very significant for me. The worst part was that I had money on me that I could have used to pay for them! After a lifetime of becoming “educated,” I went and broke a cardinal rule that we supposedly learned as toddlers. Apparently I missed that day of preschool.</p>\n<p>The following weeks were laden with sleepless nights and questions about what was going to happen to me. Was I going to get kicked out of UCSB? Was I going to have to go to court? What were the side effects of my stupidity going to be? After weeks of tossing and turning over my uncertain future, I finally got my answer. My savior came in the form of a meeting that admitted me into the Restorative Justice program on campus. The program essentially serves as an alternative, more constructive penance that helps you fix whatever wrongdoings you may have committed. This was a much better solution than the medieval punishment for stealing of chopping off a hand (which I was expecting).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During the RJ circle, I shared my story with a group of people who were affected by my actions. After hearing how I affected the people in the circle, the group and I came up with some things I could do to make up for my wrongdoing and give back to my community. As part of the sanctions, I was able to talk to both the asset protection manager at UCSB’s Bookstore as well as the local District Attorney’s office, the people I would have faced if not for qualifying for the RJ program.</p>\n<p>I was utterly shocked to learn that the bookstore loses over $50,000 a year from shoplifting. On top of that, I discovered that all of the money from the bookstore goes back to UCSB students in one way or another, so I was basically stealing from myself, my friends and the rest of my colleagues at UCSB. I went on to find out that I could have been facing thousands of dollars in fines, legal fees, possible jail time and the lifelong brand as a criminal. All of this for a simple little pair of headphones!</p>\n<p>Some people think that stealing something of such a minute nature can’t have that much effect on their life or the people they stole from. I thought that way for a while, and let me be the first to tell you that my life will forever be changed by the side effects of my seemingly trivial unlawful acquisition of merchandise.</p>\n<p>My parents always told me to learn lessons the easy way by not making the mistakes yourself. I learned this one the hard way, and I hope that everyone will take my mistake and learn from where I went wrong. The moral of the story? Don’t steal from the Bookstore or anywhere else for that matter. It is just not worth all of the side effects.</p>\n<p>Zach Healy is a fourth-year communication major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46739\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46739\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/","id":6035,"author":{"id":521,"name":"Zach Healy"},"related":[6034,6033,6032],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"California’s New “End the Death Penalty” Initiative Proves Inherently Unjust","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In the upcoming elections this year — the June primary and the November general — California citizens will have the chance to exercise their rather unique (and, in my opinion, rather silly) abilit...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the upcoming elections this year — the June primary and the November general — California citizens will have the chance to exercise their rather unique (and, in my opinion, rather silly) ability to exercise direct democracy and vote on a series of propositions. Among those propositions, yet to be numbered but certain to be on the November ballot, will be California’s “End the Death Penalty” initiative, which seeks to replace the death penalty as the maximum criminal sentence with life in prison without possibility of parole. Though there are some parts of the law that everyone should agree with, the main provision eliminating the death penalty is utterly inane and patently unjust.</p>\n<p>Before I elaborate on why eliminating the death penalty is a fundamentally unjust action, it is worth noting that the minor provisions of this proposition are sound. For example, if the law passed, former death row inmates would be required to work in the prison system and have all of their wages garnished to repay the relatives of their victims. Frankly, I don’t know why we don’t require the convicted perpetrators of any violent actions such as rape or robbery to do the same. The establishment of a $100 million fund to help law enforcement solve homicide cases would be a refreshing instance of the state actually spending money on a vital service rather than our exorbitant welfare structure.</p>\n<p>However, as much as these provisions make sense, eliminating the death penalty as punishment for murder is fundamentally unjust, not just according to any moral code, but the foundational documents of our republic. John Locke’s Second Treatise on Civil Government, the philosophical document on which our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution are based, lays out very clearly that no person may rob another human being of his life, liberty or property. Such an action is not one of someone who is in civil society, but one who has rejected the social contract and re-entered the state of nature. While Locke has those who enter civil society give up the right to personally kill a murderer, he also explicitly states that we give up this right with the understanding that the government will exact justice for us! Without such an assurance that the government will repay in kind, how then can we consider our government to be a just one?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lastly — as a Christian, in addition to being conservative — I feel I must dissuade you, dear reader, from the blatant misconceptions surrounding what the Christian faith has to say on this issue. Contrary to liberal opinion and the teachings of the Catholic Church (whose California affiliates have endorsed the proposition), the death penalty is not — as they claim — morally wrong according to either the Old or New Testaments of the Bible. The Ten Commandments, as given to the prophet Moses, prohibit murder, not killing. In fact, the Bible states repeatedly that the death penalty is not only a just punishment for murder, but that the relatives of those who have been murdered should accept nothing less than for the perpetrator to be put to death.</p>\n<p>While several provisions of this proposition make sense, the main argument made by proponents — that the death penalty is morally unjust — is false. Indeed, a civil society must have some provision for death as punishment for murder or it is not a just society at all.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Robin is the Daily Nexus conservative columnist and a third-year poltical science and history major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46743\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/californias-death-penalty-initiative-proves-inherently-unjust/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46743\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/californias-death-penalty-initiative-proves-inherently-unjust/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/californias-death-penalty-initiative-proves-inherently-unjust/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/californias-death-penalty-initiative-proves-inherently-unjust/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/californias-death-penalty-initiative-proves-inherently-unjust/","id":6002,"author":{"id":500,"name":"Jeffrey Robin"},"related":[6001,6000,5999],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Recounts Night in Jail after BUI Arrest","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The purpose of the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Dept., according to their website, is to “utilize bike patrol and officers from the CHP and UCSB Police to provide safety and enforcement for the...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The purpose of the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Dept., according to their website, is to “utilize bike patrol and officers from the CHP and UCSB Police to provide safety and enforcement for the community of Isla Vista.” In a small community like ours, where the majority of citizens are college students, are people more afraid of the police officers or of the actual crimes? I am a 138 lb. woman, who had four drinks within an hour span on April 20, 2012, before attending the SBTRKT concert at the Hub. I am 21 years old and didn’t drink for over 2 hours until operating my bike and felt fine to ride my bike, or as the police like to call it, “driving your bike.”</p>\n<p>My friend and I are seniors fulfilling our last quarter at UCSB. At approximately 12:30 a.m., we were stopped on our bikes when we were eight houses away from our home on Trigo Road. The cops stopped us for not having bike lights on our bikes and then proceeded to ask us about our night. However, he eventually asked us if we had anything to drink. Shortly after taking the breathalyzer test five times, my BAC ranged from a .13 to a .14. Then I was handcuffed. The officers looked through our wallets and demanded the passwords to our phones. Subsequently, my friend scored a .156, and we were both in handcuffs on our way to the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>This is where my perception of the police force took a turn for the worse. My arresting officer, Officer Clocherty, was driving, and I was stationed in the passenger seat, and my friend was in the back seat with Clocherty’s partner. On the way to the jail, Officer Clocherty was tailgating going 90 miles an hour, rolling stop signs and talking to me about how he was a state champion wrestler in 1996. Not only did we get lost on the way to the jail, Officer Clocherty had to call his boss to see if he could legally take us to jail and had no idea whether a BUI was an infraction or a misdemeanor. When I told the officer he was breaking laws, he replied, “I have my lights on.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>My jail experience left me craving to reform the system that seems to only perpetuate crime, the very thing the police are meant to stop. I have never experienced such a loss of rights, a loss of freedom and a feeling that I was not in control of my own self.</p>\n<p>When I was being processed, Officers Clocherty and Alexander Fuller were exchanging jokes about an inmate I could see through a window. He was standing on a bench in his cell. Officer Fuller yelled, “Jump! Do it! Kill yourself!” and they both erupted into laughter.</p>\n<p>Once in the cell, I met Akemi Neufeldt, a student at SBCC who was arrested that night for a DUI. Although arrested for a DUI, Neufeldt was not driving the car. Neufeldt’s boyfriend was driving her car when he attempted to drift and he hit a parked car. Neufeldt and her boyfriend got out of the totaled car and waited until the cops came 30 minutes later. In that waiting period, Neufeldt took her keys and got her car insurance out of her dashboard. The cops came and arrested Neufeldt because she had the keys in her hand at their time of arrival and claimed her boyfriend, even though he stated he had been driving, was lying and covering for his girlfriend. They had reached their conclusions and took Neufeldt to jail, and her boyfriend went home free.</p>\n<p>The people with the power to take away our rights completely lacked compassion altogether. The jail guards were overly flirtatious and malicious, while the women jail guards were stereotypically on a power trip. Not every worker in the jail fits these descriptions; there were two people in particular, namely Officer Magri and another woman, that were exceptions to the rule. These are the people that should be celebrated. In the face of what seems like the Stanford prison experiment, these two people I will take note of as the people that retained compassion despite the norm.</p>\n<p>After 10 and a half hours of being in jail (for some reason we were in longer than the two DUI cases), we were released into another room where we awaited to be given our property. The mistreatment was not over. The woman checking us out, Dominguez, took 30 minutes. She conversed with her coworkers about life, and then got out our cell phones and purses and for some reason she felt the need to put them on the ground and kick them over to us.</p>\n<p>I am writing this because I believe people need to know. If the overall police system became entirely corrupt, would we have the means to overcome it? Whether you are being stopped on your bike for not stopping at a stop sign or given a ticket for not having a bike light or any other ridiculously distributed citation, people need to know that it happened. These citations are not given out to “protect safety.” Where are the police when real crimes occur in our neighborhood? Incidences of rape and violence are reported every weekend; burglaries are treated as an afterthought. An armed robbery just occurred last Friday, and the perpetrator is still out on the loose. The desire for a powerful position in society has clearly corrupted the minds of these police men and women. People that become police officers because they want the power are not the right people for the job for the very fact that they are power hungry. My sophomore year, I saw an SBCC student, Willy Stober, tazered by a police officer after he asked him not to give him a noise violation. The cop acted in this way because he felt “threatened by Stober’s friends and needed to set an example.” I asked Stober why he didn’t proclaim his innocence in court and he replied, “Who are they going to believe, me or a cop? It’s his word versus mine.” Change is in order and safety needs to be the ultimate priority of police, not exercising their seemingly limitless power on innocent bystanders.</p>\n<p>Katy Roberts is a fourth-year global studies major.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

After all, four years is not long compared to 15 or 30 years. But students are just as affected by the local laws as those residents who plan to spend a much longer time in the Santa Barbara County. Today, it is the Social Host Ordinance; tomorrow it will be something else — for example, employment laws. UCSB students not only live and study but also work in Santa Barbara County, therefore such laws could have a direct effect on their jobs and incomes.</p>\n<p>Besides, while most students do move on after four years of college, some stay for much longer, either because they find work in the area or choose to attend graduate school at UCSB. Student groups, such as CALPIRG, are constantly working to solve environmental and social problems, not just nationally and globally, but also locally. If student groups can be involved in bettering the local community, they should certainly be allowed the right to have a say in the laws by which that community lives. Truth is, UCSB students are an integral part of the Santa Barbara community and they have as much right to a voice in local affairs as the other residents.</p>\n<p>Even if you are still convinced that the student community is too transient to feel any long-term effects of local elections and legislation, student disenfranchisement is, simply, illegal and discriminatory. Nowhere in the requirements for voter registration in California does it say that you must stay in a particular city or county for a certain amount of time before you can vote, not to mention that disenfranchising students would also make it impossible for them to vote on statewide and nationwide issues. Nor are students the only transitory social group. Members of the military and their families move around a lot, as do low-income families. Should these groups not be allowed to vote either?</p>\n<p>Interestingly, no one has attempted to disenfranchise mobile social groups in general, instead targeting students specifically. It would seem that the groups and candidates that wish to disenfranchise students are not so much worried about student transience as the fact that the student community is powerful, well-informed and likely to swing the election against them. On the first two counts, they are correct and, if they continue threatening our right to a voice, they will be right on all three.</p>\n<p>Alexandra Lototsky is a third-year political science and Slavic languages and literatures major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-26/students-isla-vista-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-26/students-isla-vista-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-26/students-isla-vista-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-26/students-isla-vista-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-26/students-isla-vista-politics/","id":6059,"author":{"id":515,"name":"Alexandra Lototsky"},"related":[6058,6057,6056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Worry About Tomorrow Tomorrow: “The Smoke Clears Down the Road”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As 4/20 revelers across Isla Vista celebrated Friday (and throughout the weekend), it was a good time to appreciate the special time and place we can enjoy here.

Or learn to surf, or go hiking or skydiving or to Vegas for a weekend you’ll never remember (but no one is allowed to speak of)?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Why shouldn’t you hang with a few good buds with some good bud and a six-pack so you can relax and share good times?</p>\n<p>If it’s all just a ride, make it thrilling.</p>\n<p>But even as the smoke rose and slowly clouded the neighborhood’s atmosphere on Friday, we knew student life ends eventually. Peter Pan is a fairytale; real kids grow up. For educated professionals, that tends to mean losing the dreadlocks, buying a few suits and getting ready to devote your life to long hours so you can eat and hopefully buy yourself a nice home and some toys.</p>\n<p>We know we’ll have to work at some point — a sobering thought and frightening prospect in its own right — but we’ve come to accept that reality and are preparing ourselves for it. The details are still troubling, though.</p>\n<p>Since a lot of jobs drug test their employees, many will have to decide whether they’re willing to risk their professional career for a few coughing fits and giggles. As stoners gaze down their bong tubes, bowls packed and lighters ready, I wonder how many have an idea of when the days of sweet and skunky smelling chronic smoke filling their lungs will end.</p>\n<p>“Thanks Mary, you were great, but can you get out of here? We have work to do.” It takes practice to say it right.</p>\n<p>Is it just laughter that they’d be missing out on? Would they miss the taste of fresh baked brownies or the sound of Marley altered by the effect of a burning joint? What about those unique and entertaining conversations with friends and strangers or all the thrilling incidents and adventures that occur as a result of their seemingly harmless habit?</p>\n<p>But is it harmless? Is the smoke that fills the air of people’s homes, cars and streets a friendly ghost or deadly spectre? People walking down the street with cancer sticks dangling from their self-indulgent smiles seem to dismiss the question as irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Are the good times worth the costs and risks? Is it worth it?</p>\n<p>Questions hang in the air, blending with the haze. Dare I venture into that cannabis closet, hiding my illicit tools whenever I hear footsteps through the door? Do I want to bear the stress of fearing a drug test or a police stop and search caused by a strange smell on my person?</p>\n<p>Light from a nearby window reflects off the bong on my desk and the glare assaults my eyes. I move the piece and reach for my grinder, forgetting the questions I don’t have to answer today.</p>\n<p>Let tomorrow’s obstacles stay there.

She has led countless rallies for students’ rights and protests against injustices. She has stood in solidarity with those who have been wronged, from the victims of the pepper spraying at UC Davis to Trayvon Martin to the students at UCSB who face discrimination each and every day.

He has worked with the nonpartisan Voter Registration Volunteer Coalition, which registers thousands of voters every year and will be tasked with leading UCSB’s voter registration drive for the 2012 elections. In order for us as students to have a voice in our community, we must register and vote en masse for candidates that will represent our interests. It will take the leadership of Nadim Houssain to continue our legacy of registering more voters than any other school in the nation and to ensure that the student voice is heard by our elected leaders.</p>\n<p>Betty Aynalem, a third-year resident assistant and vice president of the Sociology Association, is a progressive student that will represent the needs of the UCSB community in the local affairs (EVPLA) office. She will maintain a strong working relationship with the elected officials of Santa Barbara County, working closely with Doreen Farr’s office on local projects in I.V. It is refreshing to see a candidate that is determined to build coalitions with other groups working on similar projects as the EVPLA, saving time, energy and money. During this time of deep budget cuts, this is the kind of thinking that we need in A.S. to ensure that UCSB continues to provide quality programs for all students while not wasting student fees.</p>\n<p>While Guadalupe Ibarra and Mayra Segovia are both very strong and qualified candidates for Internal Vice President, the edge goes to Lupe because of her inspiring passion for political education. She sees the lack of knowledge that students have about Associated Students and will fix it by providing more information on the projects representatives are working on to the A.S. website. As Democrats, we believe in the right of constituents to easily see what their elected officials are working on. However, as our members have come and gone, none of them seem to know what their A.S. elected officials have done because both the social media and websites of A.S. officials have lacked updated information. We believe Lupe understands this and will bring a new era of transparency and accessibility to A.S.</p>\n<p>Mac Kennedy has been an active member of Campus Democrats at UCSB and will bring a Democratic perspective to the Associated Students Senate. He understands that the role of a Senator is to go above and beyond the prescribed duties. Mac has been active with the EVPSA office, KCSB and the Daily Nexus in addition to Campus Democrats at UCSB.

Assuming that the Pirate was finally commandeering the campus, I thought little of it. However, meandering my way to class on Monday, I realized the true intention of Occupy Bike Path: to set up the Carnival of Horrors that is Student Representative Elections. As it turns out, members of the OPP had sat for days in order to cinch the best campaigning positions. What a shame it was completely pointless.</p>\n<p>There are two main parties gunning for your vote: the Open People’s Party (OPP) and the Democratic Process Party (DP).  A quick glance at both parties’ websites definitively shows there is absolutely no difference between them. Both clamor to espouse the idea that they more accurately represent the common student, despite the fact that I challenge you to think of anything productive either party has ever done to help the school. Each party clings helplessly to their desire to run some sort of high school mock political election.</p>\n<p>Look, it’s just like the real thing!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This leaves you with two options: Either you don’t care and won’t vote; or you’ll take your time to research the candidates, realize they have no real issues,and won’t vote.

As you’re settling into your final quarter of the school year, many of you are applying for summer internships and finalizing your plans to study abroad, while others may be getting ready to graduate and start a career … and wondering how you’re going to pay off those student loans.</p>\n<p>At a time when student loan debt has surpassed credit card debt in our country, I know this is a very real concern for soon-to-be graduates. The high cost of paying back your loans can be substantial — determining the type of career you pursue or even where you’ll live. As a former student at UCSB myself and the mother of college grads, I know how daunting a challenge it can be. That’s why in 2007 I worked hard to help pass into law the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. This bipartisan law cut the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans in half, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, over a four-year period, easing the burden on thousands of students and their families.</p>\n<p>While I had pushed for the interest-rate cut to be longer, Congress and then-President Bush compromised and set the lower rate for only a period of four years. That means these historically low rates will double — going back up to 6.8 percent on July 1 — if Congress does not act soon. This troubling increase would cost a student borrower thousands of dollars more in interest payments over the life of his or her loan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Our country needs to be investing in higher education, not pulling back. And with tuition skyrocketing in California and in states across the country, it is more important than ever that the federal government take action to keep education affordable and within reach to all. That’s why I’m supporting legislation to keep student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent. So far, the majority party has refused to bring our bill up for a vote, but I keep pushing them. For example, last month I forced a House vote on legislation to at least allow the Department of Education to take any steps it could take to make college more affordable if Congress won’t act. Unfortunately, my legislation was defeated on a party-line vote.</p>\n<p>Lower rates on student loans are important, but I know that Pell Grants are also critical to helping thousands of Gauchos afford the ever-increasing costs of tuition and textbooks. In fact, over 15,000 students in my congressional district alone benefit from this vital federal financial assistance, and it’s one reason why I’ve continued to push for increased funding for Pell Grants.</p>\n<p>We passed legislation in 2009 to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,550, and I’m urging the leadership in the House of Representatives to increase the award to $5,635. But despite the soaring costs of going to college, some actually want to cut back this vital assistance. In fact, the budget the House just passed would cut Pell Grants by more than $1,000, raising costs for the nearly 10 million students getting grants today. Needless to say, that budget did not get my vote.</p>\n<p>I know these are tough times for college students. Tuition is going up and graduates are facing a very tough job market. But for those of you who have gone the extra mile to get into college and worked so hard to graduate, I’ll do everything I can to help support you. I believe we must make investments in higher education and give you — our nation’s future leaders and innovators — the tools to compete successfully in a global economy and make a difference in your community.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you on campus sometime soon. In the meantime, I hope you’ll also get in touch with me on Facebook and Twitter. My Twitter handle is @RepLoisCapps.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and Go Gauchos!</p>\n<p>Lois Capps is the representative for the 23rd District of Calif.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46155\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46155\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/","id":6057,"author":{"id":431,"name":"Lois Capps"},"related":[6056,6055,6054],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Is She the Farr Better Candidate?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In 2008 Steve Pappas lost the 3rd District Supervisor seat to Doreen Farr by a slim margin.

Disgruntled by the two-to-one majority that the student population of UCSB and Isla Vista gave to Farr, Pappas began a lengthy appeal process which aimed to invalidate all I.V. votes due to what he declared was improper voter registration proceedings. His claims were repeatedly dismissed in court but Pappas was not discouraged.</p>\n<p>Last December, Pappas announced that he would once again run against Farr in this year’s June 5 election for 3rd District Supervisor. Last week, Anna Vlahos, executive director of Stop Voter Fraud — an organization co-founded by Pappas — sent an open letter to the Santa Barbara Voter Registration Office asking them to discount voter registrations from before 2010, specifically the student population of UCSB and Isla Vista — just in time for the upcoming district supervisor election.</p>\n<p>Pappas has made it clear that he does not respect the student voter. Pappas not only disregards student concerns, but also is actively striving to exclude students from the election process. He claims that since we are constantly changing our addresses, we are not true constituents and do not deserve representation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the other hand, Doreen Farr has consistently focused her attention on student concerns.

Many of us have all the qualifications needed for a job, but are not hired because we fail to effectively market ourselves to employers. Is that our fault? Not really. Honestly, there aren’t that many places on campus to practice this invaluable skill. Having a stellar resume and a hard-earned bachelor’s degree proudly written at the top is only the first step to landing a job. But even if you have that, do you know where to send it? Do you have connections in HR departments at companies? I know I don’t. And I am frustrated that this school doesn’t do much to help foster those connections. How can I get across what I alone have to offer that no other college graduate has?</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone. Most students struggle with deciding how to best market themselves and prove their uniqueness because it isn’t easy. It requires an analysis of who you are and what you want. The most important thing to remember is to be true to yourself. Even if you are not currently seeking employment, it is still critical to have an “elevator pitch” prepared just in case you run into someone who works for your dream employer. An elevator pitch is a one-minute spiel that sums up who you are and what you have to offer. This is your personal brand that you should know by heart and be able to share confidently with others.</p>\n<p>Once you have your brand down, it’s important to build your network of connections. Many people will tell you that they heard about a job opening or even got hired because they had connections to the right people. As a UCSB student there do exist some connections to faculty and co-workers that we have honed over our years here. An expanded network means you have a greater chance that one of your connections leads to a job, internship or even just valuable career advice that changes your life. Plain and simple.</p>\n<p>The good news is it seems that my concerns have been heard. The Career Peers at Career Services are hosting a special event to help people like me learn how to market themselves and make connections. They’ve called their event “Brand Yourself for Success: A Night of Networking.” While this is their first attempt at doing something like this, it is nice to know that certain departments on campus really are concerned with making sure we go into the real world with a skill to help us land jobs. On Thursday, April 26, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Mosher Alumni House, they are bringing in a keynote speaker to lecture on how to brand yourself for the job market. Following the lecture, they are bringing in over 20 employers from different industries as well as some faculty to listen and critique how we come across and our first impressions. From what they say, the event is aimed at providing valuable feedback on how well we are selling ourselves. The best part is that it is an opportunity to practice networking with professionals in a setting where they are completely focused on meeting you and helping you.</p>\n<p>This event is a valuable opportunity for UCSB students to improve their professional image.

But every day I feel like more and more of us are formulating our own stubborn opinions about music, television, pop culture and the like.</p>\n<p>For example, I have to acknowledge Justin Bieber has talent. Of course he does. I just don’t buy his music because it’s not my thing. I don’t mean anything personal by it and I don’t think I’m supposed to fall under the Belieber demographic anyway. That said, the boy can dance and carry a tune all right from what I can tell. That fact doesn’t concern his haters. The language that dudes my age use to describe this poor kid is nothing short of volatile. Making some cash and being perceived as overrated is plenty to garner some infamy in the 21st century.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Deciding to hate something is even the go-to mentality in a lot of ways. I have never listened to a single Nickelback song, but I still have the luxury of knowing they’re the worst band in the entire world. I’m perfectly aware that that poorly formulated opinion came right out of the ether. Furthermore, it’s my prerogative to perpetuate that belief via a cowardly tweet and/or wall post. Thanks, society.</p>\n<p>In the age of the internet and social networks, it’s near-impossible to express genuine sincerity for something without a snarky retort from a cynical 15-year-old in a dark room somewhere. If I took my baby cousin to see The Lorax, I wouldn’t think about admitting to liking it. The only acceptable review is, “Fucking sucks … blah blah blah … Goddamn Hollywood … blah blah blah …” in a sardonic circle of guys smoking Camel crushes with their hoodies up to keep the sunlight and earnestness out of their eyes.</p>\n<p>When did we all get so bitter and jaded? Did this happen overnight or has it always been like this? With reality shows snatching the highest ratings on television and dance pop effortlessly topping the charts, everyone is ready to believe that their taste alone is impeccable. It’s a frightening and polarizing way to think and I don’t see it stopping anytime soon.</p>\n<p>When Conan O’Brien left The Tonight Show after the time slot controversy, he asked something of the young people in his final farewell: “Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism; for the record, it’s my least favorite quality. It doesn’t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get.” This is a sentiment I’ve since tried to live by. Bear in mind, it was said by someone who was muscled out of a late night institution most comedians only dream of. If Conan can still keep the faith after that experience, I’m not gonna let flashy pop stars or silly kids’ movies get me down.</p>\n<p>Where is the love?</p>\n<p><em>Dash Nye is a third-year film and media studies major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/","id":6051,"author":{"id":514,"name":"Dash Nye"},"related":[6050,6049,6048],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Banishing the No- Prefix Once and For All: Alternatives to Next Year’s Floatopia","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Another year has gone by, and once again Floatopia was successfully banned.

That’s three years now, which in my opinion is pretty damn depressing. As a third-year student, I got here just in time for it to be banned, which is how I would imagine it would feel like being Charlie in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” if instead Willy Wonka had just been like, “Fuck you, Charlie. I changed my mind. No one’s coming in,” and then surrounded the factory with cops.</p>\n<p>In addition, and adding insult to injury, I went to Cal Poly’s Cesar Chavez day over the break, and it was awesome. I don’t like to admit that Cal Poly does anything better than us, but, I mean … they might kind of be doing a half decent job with their beach party. So, to help us get back on track, I’ve brainstormed some other ideas for annual spring events that maybe we could have instead … Or threaten to have.</p>\n<p><strong>New Floatopia Ideas:</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em> Goat-topia</em></p>\n<p>In this version, we get ancient Greek as fuck. Everyone puts on togas, we drink a bunch of wine, and then as an entire student body, we go kill all of the goats that are out by Sands and eat them. Preferably with large fires that we cook them over. It’ll be fun. If you’re vegan and against this, then it’s not like any of us wanted to hang out with you anyway. And the goats are totally cool with it; I asked them and they didn’t say no. By being vegan, you’re ignoring the goats’ freedom of choice and ability to consent to being eaten.</p>\n<p><em>Blow-topia</em></p>\n<p>This one’s pretty simple: Lots of cocaine. LOTS OF IT.</p>\n<p><em>Bro-topia</em></p>\n<p>Some might argue this is the ‘topia we already host every year. Due to a definite increase in the number of tattooed douchebags wandering the street asking, “Where’s the party at?” I’d say there might be some truth in that assumption.</p>\n<p>However, I’d argue this: We can do it better.</p>\n<p>Instead of passively allowing bros to come, this time we actively recruit them. Everyone invites as many out-of-town bros as possible. NO GIRLS. Absolutely no out-of-town girls allowed (this will make sense in a second). Once your bros are adequately hammered, preferably off tequila, bring them to DP, where the DJs will be playing a specific playlist of only Skrillex songs. This should lead to the perfect storm — thousands of confused, drunk bros getting increasingly confused and angry, because — “Why are my eight bros and I not getting laid by beautiful blonde bikini models like we imagined?” They’ll begin to try to think of a reason, but then quickly remember that thinking is difficult and it’s easier to just get really angry. But I FUCKING LOVE Skrillex, they’ll think to themselves. This song is FUCKING SICK. I’M SO PUMPED up. Hey. HEY! HEY DID YOU JUST HIT MY FUCKING SHOULDER, BRO?! BRO, THAT GUY JUST HIT MY FUCKING SHOULDER. And BAM! The show is on!</p>\n<p>Sexual frustration + drunkenness + thousands of bros = biggest bro fight ever. With no women to hold their attention, none of the surrounding bros will be able to keep themselves from joining in after whichever short-tempered bro throws the first punch. And this should be pretty awesome to watch, as long as it’s safely from an upstairs deck. I imagine we’ll be able to actually taste the testosterone in the air. As a prize, I say last man standing at the end of it gets crowned King Bro and is given the sorority girl of his choice — who, lets face it, is totally down for him anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Ho-topia</em></p>\n<p>Ok, once again, this miiiight be the one we already throw every year. But personally I think our women are classier than that. To be totally honest, I don’t exactly have any real ideas for it because I imagine it would look something like a “Girls Gone Wild” video. And if I knew how to create THAT, I wouldn’t be wasting my time writing this right now.</p>\n<p><em>No-topia</em></p>\n<p>Maybe if an unnamed individual wouldn’t make a public Facebook event every year, this is the event that authorities would THINK we were putting on, and then we could go ahead and have an awesome beach day in the ocean instead. But apparently that’s impossible, so I guess we can just completely forget it. FORGET USING LOGIC.</p>\n<p><em>Glow-topia</em></p>\n<p>We specify a weekend night to turn off all the lights in I.V., and everyone wears glow stuff.</p>\n<p>I was writing this as a joke, but this one actually sounds kind of awesome. We should probably actually do this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In closing, that sums up my ideas for alternate spring festivities. Basically I can’t think of anything else good that rhymes with “flo.” However, if you can think of any I missed, please write to the Nexus and make sure they know.</p>\n<p>However, to conclude the entire thing, I would like to provide one more last idea. This year “Deltopia” somehow ended up on Easter weekend. This was a horrible combination, needless to say. However, if it does by chance fall on Easter weekend again next year, I think that maybe we should take advantage of the unique situation. We should seize the opportunity to celebrate both Easter and Floatopia at once — by getting drunk and crucifying whoever makes a public Floatopia Facebook event.</p>\n<p><em>George Publius is a third-year student.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/","id":6048,"author":{"id":511,"name":"George Publius"},"related":[6047,6046,6045],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"There’s No Denying Invisible Children’s Success in Spreading the Word on Kony","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As everyone has heard by now, the viral marketing campaign KONY 2012, made by the nonprofit company Invisible Children, has recently come under intense scrutiny in the media.

Most coverage of the massively successful 30-minute video has been extremely negative, criticizing the video’s questionable message and Invisible Children itself. As a San Diego native, where IC is headquartered, I am very familiar with the nonprofit. I first heard about the company during my freshman year of high school, around the time it was founded in 2005.</p>\n<p>IC’s three young creators, San Diegans Jason Russell, Ben Keesey and Chris Carver, filmed a documentary about child soldiers in northern Uganda in 2003. After returning to California, they set up a nonprofit company and screened the film to as many people as possible, attempting to raise awareness of the Ugandans’ plight. The main operations of IC at its start were to screen the documentary, give talks to raise awareness of northern Uganda and sell bracelets made by Ugandans — providing employment to locals and visibility for their company. This idea of “raising awareness” is key to many nonprofits, especially with issues international in nature, and people mainly rely on some larger force to make a difference. IC also encouraged writing letters and calling government representatives to bring change in Uganda.</p>\n<p>During high school, I became extremely involved with Invisible Children. It was a nonprofit aimed at teens, with a media-savvy style and attractive, relatable founders, which successfully engaged the apathetic youth, who were largely uninterested in charity work. After my friends and I saw the film, we immediately bought the bracelets and told everyone we knew about it. The documentary also spurred my deeper interest in African politics. I joined my high school’s Model United Nations club, attended local African events and began researching the situation in various African countries. I even met Benjamin Ajak, one of the “Lost Boys from Sudan” and co-author of They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When I came to UCSB, I lost touch with IC and African politics, but always supported the company and its message. I had heard of the KONY 2012 campaign from friends who were still involved in IC, and I “attended” the event on Facebook and re-blogged the video in an act of lazy support. It seems many did the same, as the video became an Internet sensation, bringing Invisible Children into a harsh spotlight.</p>\n<p>While I am not an expert or a proponent of KONY 2012, I still do not completely understand why the video brought such intense hatred of IC. The loudest critique I’ve heard is on the video’s “oversimplification” of the situation in northern Uganda. Filmmaker Jason Russell retorted, “It’s oversimplified for a reason,” being they hoped to spread a general message quickly and easily to encourage people to personally investigate further. I agree with Russell’s justification, since their initial documentary spurred great interest and action in me. Many also criticize IC’s use of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter to spread the message. This confuses me, as these sites are generously employed by every major news organization (even the president) to quickly spread information. It also corresponds with IC’s aim to target a young audience. I personally believe that any awareness, even through “cheap” mass-marketing websites, is beneficial not only to IC in gaining supporters, but also in compelling people who have never heard of northern Uganda to learn more.</p>\n<p>Though Invisible Children has a special significance to me, I absolutely love that people are questioning and criticizing this nonprofit. In order to keep companies and governments honest, it is imperative that individuals probe below the surface instead of passively accepting “universal truths.” But this also means citizens must question these independent examinations as well and make up their own minds about the issue. The explosion of media coverage on KONY 2012 has proven this passion for legitimacy. But don’t take my word for it …</p>\n<p>Corie Anderson is a third-year film and media studies major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/","id":6047,"author":{"id":510,"name":"Corie Anderson"},"related":[6046,6045,6044],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“I’m just a normal guy.
