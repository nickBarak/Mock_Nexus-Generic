The administration has shown zero interest in public health insofar as it concerns their continued refusal of safe working conditions in UC hospitals. They have shown utter contempt for the well being of their academic employees as class sizes continue to expand, and TAs overwork themselves to keep up with the privatization of public education. They have displayed complete disregard for the history of police brutality at the hands of UCPD in their selection of America’s Top Cop to lead the 10-campus system.</p>\n<p>However (and most suddenly with the announcement), they seem to care a great deal about public health but, then again, UC administration loves its own ideas and forms committees to validate its own conclusion. This simultaneously displays two things: their particular view of democracy and their hatred of any democracy that would come from the stakeholders of the university (students and workers).  Students — undergraduate and graduate alike — and staff, service workers and faculty need to start asking harder questions. Why aren’t we asked about what the University should look like? Why can we only participate within the proposals of the Regents? What does the top-down model of UC governance say about the possible future of public education?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I doubt we will receive an answer, but we don’t need to wait to be asked.</p>\n<p><em>Earl Perez-Foust is a graduate student in the comparative literature department at UCSB.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 8, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

In retrospect, my biggest regret was sitting through a meeting that could possibly be interpreted as the student body legitimizing her appointment as UC President.</p>\n<p>Most disappointing, though, was Janet Napolitano’s outright refusal to host a public forum for all students, choosing to instead meet discreetly with less than one percent of the UCSB student population. As students marched outside on Nov. 21 and 22 with the hopes of catching a glimpse of Janet Napolitano, it became more and more apparent that the voice of the students is not something she takes an interest in.</p>\n<p>Our new UC President began with full control over the conversation and directed us to answer this question: “If you were the UC President and you were in my position, what issues would you prioritize?” This initially seemed like an ideal situation — a system controlled by the very people feeling the repercussions of massive tuition hikes and oppressive policies.</p>\n<p>Yet as the meeting progressed, I became aware that Napolitano was giving no legitimacy to the students’ voices. Napolitano did not sympathize as students attempted to hold her accountable for her policies during her term as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, merely justifying her actions and policies instead of moving forward.</p>\n<p>One student felt compelled to thank her for her “service” to this country — a privilege in itself. While she was building her reputation as Secretary of the DHS through her “service,” others who lived under her policies suffered the traumatic repercussions of countless deportations and unprecedented surveillance. While those who are privileged enough to live comfortably dared to thank Janet Napolitano for her “service,” other students bravely managed to come face-to-face with the human being that was responsible for the deportation of their own family members.</p>\n<p>Hopes for a more affordable, accessible UC system under her leadership were completely shattered by the end of the meeting. Napolitano showcased her disregard for a tuition-free campus in accordance with the UC Master Plan, saying that hope for the “old model” was long gone.</p>\n<p>The Master Plan, a very realistic and “tangible” action plan for the UC system, was drawn up in 1960. The idea of a free, accessible education for all Californians, regardless of race or class, became a force for change in society. However, this revolutionary plan for education — what should be the pinnacle of any democratic society — has been disregarded by UC Regents for decades and, as a result our university has turned into the privatized system we know all too well.</p>\n<p>Indifference towards one of the most profound proposals for free and accessible education is only furthered by our Associated Students’ proposal to “re-envision” a Master Plan that would fix the failures of a broken system. What we have come to know is a UC system that has been increasingly privatized and is far from mirroring the demographics of the state. In fact, acceptance of various marginalized communities has stagnated or dropped at every UC campus in the past two decades.</p>\n<p>Rather than receiving suggestions for a more accessible and equitable education system, Janet Napolitano’s interrogative demeanor pressured students to look for alternatives within their own pools of resources. This was particularly evident when asked about institutionalized retention centers and programs for struggling students of color. Her response, or lack thereof, led me to believe that this meeting was merely intended as a means to publicize her “accessibility” as the new UC President and to justify her crimes and policies of white supremacy under the Department of Homeland Security. Her failure to address the issues that students of color face with honesty is a reminder of her qualifications as a politician and not as an educator.</p>\n<p>Another student brought up the negative effects of the increasing police presence on campus, an ironic remark, considering her extensive coordination with the police at that very meeting. Napolitano attributed the racial profiling and racism in the UCPD to the lack of “police training.” Yet she failed to mention that during her reign over the DHS, she led one of the most aggressive deportation efforts in the United States — a campaign that has made people across this country, and specifically on this campus, feel targeted and unsafe. Secure communities, the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign and the aggressive border checkpoints are direct examples of her policies that promoted racial profiling.</p>\n<p>It was not only her domestic policies that she justified — Napolitano failed to recognize the coerced compliance in policies of imperialism, violence and colonization abroad, which brings to question her role as a leader in a system intended to be critical of systems she has built her reputation off of. The meeting ended with students expressing personal recollections of feeling physically unsafe on this campus, led by organizations such as Stand With Us and the Anti-Defamation League. Yet Janet Napolitano avoided the question (a common trend during the meeting), referencing instead her preference for “free speech” in these situations.</p>\n<p>I left the meeting feeling further marginalized and angry, but mostly disappointed. Any preconceived notion of higher learning in the UC system was diminished. I came to this campus hoping to be educated on issues plaguing various communities in this country. Instead, I give legitimacy to government practices through Janet Napolitano, I invest in the military and prison industrial complex and I am entangled in two of the largest nuclear weapons facilities in the United States. We hope to leave college with a diploma and decolonized minds, but we sometimes forget the true privilege and responsibility of being a part of such a prestigious university. Janet Napolitano’s appointment is just another way in which the UC system has legitimized white supremacist, racist and imperialist policies. We can no longer be compliant with the institution that is meant to educate and decolonize, which is why the resignation of Janet Napolitano is the only right answer.</p>\n<p><em>Kat A. is a fourth-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Such pro-peace Palestinians need all the help they can get, because the two Palestinian governments in power today refuse to accept the principle of “two states for two peoples.” In Gaza, Hamas rules with an iron fist and continues to prepare for war against Israel. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ four-year term expired in 2009, but he has refused to hold new elections. And In both places, Palestinian security forces intimidate and jail dissidents who criticize their leaders.</p>\n<p>We studied the SJP conference program. None of the Palestinian governments’ human rights violations were mentioned. Instead, the program was filled with euphemisms about the importance of destroying Israel, the most progressive state in the Middle East.

Essentially, what I’ve gathered is that over the years, this institution has moved further and further away from what it was designed to provide — top quality, accessible higher education. The ambition and application of this mission was primarily the vision of Clark Kerr, the legendary President of the UC system. Kerr’s plan was formulated during the 1950s and 60s, a time in which California was plagued by issues of an inefficient tax system, significant state budget issues and a worrying disconnect between accessibility and enrollment demand; a time quite interestingly enough that eerily mirrors our own.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference between that golden age of California higher education and our time however, is in the manner in which our state is dealing with the problem. Whereas the decision-process regarding fixing higher education once involved those actually experienced with matters of higher education, it appears that currently we would rather choose to outsource our problem solving to those who have never been the problem solving type. This is why it is particularly disheartening that a few weeks ago our own Associated Students Senate chose to shoot down a vote of “no confidence” for our newest appointed President of the UC system, Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>The decision ties in to our institution’s recent history and degradation of its original master plan on two fronts. First, it is quite clear that Napolitano’s experience as former head of the Department of Homeland Security, where she gained a knack for deporting individuals and being in the good graces of the National Security Agency, makes her more fitting for administrating a nuclear facility than a widely respected hub of intellectual thought. Ironically, the baby-boomer laden committee appointed to select the UC president used this reasoning to explain why she was the perfect candidate when it rolled out the red carpet for Napolitano in its initial publicity blitz. Her obvious lack of experience in the field of education should be a huge red flag to us as students.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A far cry from the days of Kerr, it is evident that we now have a figurehead happier to manage whatever facilities continue to prop up the military-industrial complex than an intellectual leader with the appropriate scholastically-minded vision. With this kind of leader, we will have another 30 years of the status quo, and this university will remain a 20th century institution readying kids for a 21st century world. Regardless of what opinion you might have when it comes to the safety of undocumented students at our university as the recently failed resolution contended, a student of this university should disagree with a Napolitano reign on principle alone.</p>\n<p>Second, it is clear as daylight that the process is wholly undemocratic, and an insult to the people who as of a few years ago pump more money into the university system than our own state does. The appointment of Napolitano was approved by the UC Regents in a vote that went 25-1, with the lone dissenting voice coming from our only student representation on the board. The vote is an outright misrepresentation of the people the Regents are supposed to represent.</p>\n<p>It shouldn’t be a shocker, though. The Regents often have little to no experience in education themselves and usually end up being mere cronies to the Governor of California. This approach has failed, and it has failed hard. Clark Kerr himself was ousted by Regents handpicked by then-new Governor Ronald Reagan who was exceptionally frightened by the increasingly liberal movements of free speech and thought, or what I’d like to call “education,” going on at UC campuses across the state. Regents nowadays are obviously not much better because the cronies have only sat by while our schools become privatized and flooded by those with extraordinary means.</p>\n<p>Again, it is quite disheartening that our own Senate, made up of students like you and I, would reject a vote of no confidence on the basis of good faith in our new leader’s abilities to meet our demands and expectations of higher education, when its clear that we have been losing ground and selling out to the highest bidder with the weakest spine for decades. Ultimately, we must ask ourselves if we are willing to cease being the children of Ronald Reagan. Can we instead take charge of our university to fulfill the destiny spread out by Clark Kerr all those years ago? We have the numbers, we have the ideas and perhaps one day we’ll have the student leaders with the will to actually change things.</p>\n<p><em>Mario Vasquez is a fourth-year history major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I sat there looking down at the greatest poetry of the 20th century and I was being asked to fill in the blanks. Percy Shelley claimed: “Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration … Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” Whilst international relations students may raise an eyebrow to that, you can imagine my disappointment that their work was being reduced to some kind of verbal coloring exercise.</p>\n<p>This is by no means an attack on the professors who set the exams but rather the system that forces them to condescend to question whether we have actually read the material they set. The problem with midterms is that they’re clearly not designed to test whether you’ve engaged with what’s been taught. Rather, midterms are constructed to instill just enough fear in the girl sitting in the back row to drag her attention away from a text from the guy “who’s like super cute and totally flirted with her at the last  date night,” so she can make a quick note on what free indirect speech means.

Having smaller labia is just as normal as having bigger ones.</p>\n<p>You might be familiar with stories about how those with body issues came to be that way. About how they thought they were perfectly normal, until one day, someone made a comment to tell them they aren’t. And so begins a spiral of self-consciousness and body image issues.</p>\n<p>You see, I thought I was totally normal. That is, until I started reading literature written by people attempting to eliminate the ideal of the small labia who, in the process, painted those labia as unnatural. There seems to be a tendency that attempts to boost a group that is marginalized by putting down the rest of us who happened to not be a part of that group.</p>\n<p>Anything someone is born with is “normal”: Small labia, large labia — whatever the case may be. If you want to change that, that’s your prerogative. If you need to change it for medical reasons, by all means do it. But you shouldn’t be SHAMED into changing it, or into NOT changing it.</p>\n<p>Whatever we are born with is something to be proud of, not ashamed of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article was submitted anonymously.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

It's about to get real Hunger Games-y up in here...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Our pass times have begun, and choosing our classes is almost as important as choosing which college to attend in the first place. Restrictions, prerequisites and section times — everything has to align perfectly. And even then, half of the time it doesn’t work out.</p>\n<p>At this point, we’ve all registered at least once before, so it’s common knowledge that your first pass time on GOLD isn’t a recommendation for when you should log in to sign up for classes — it’s more of a threat. That posted time basically says, “You have from 11:15 until 11:15:30 to get all your classes, or they’re gonna be gone forever.” If you log in a minute late, your classes are gone and you’re already a mile behind everyone else. Think of it as the real-life Hunger Games, because that’s essentially what it is. If you don’t train before the start of the games, you’re already dead. So what do we do? How do we prepare ourselves for the virtual feeding frenzy? My answer is actually pretty irrelevant to the majority of you.</p>\n<p>We all have our own song and dance for trying to pick our perfect schedules, and if you go by anyone else’s method, as the “South Park” ski instructor famously said, “You’re gonna have a bad time.” Everybody knows the stereotypical panicked student who will sacrifice health, sleep and sanity for his or her bio lecture; the late-sleeper (as opposed to the five early-risers at this school), who, only in times of panic, will resort to taking a pre-10 a.m. class; and the dedicated Thirsty Thursday participant, who will take eight classes a day Monday through Thursday if it means having no class on Friday.

Her face reminded me of the one that the Econ professors make when students ask them to push their grades up from a B+ to an A-. Apparently, I was going into the registration world blind and ignorant; I had not visited<em> ratemyprofessors.com</em>, a crucial step in the pre-registration process. This website offers the curious students from colleges across the nation overall ratings of just about every professor they could ever have. From “easiness” to “helpfulness” to “clarity” to “hotness,” the different ratings are all vital to keep in mind when choosing your classes. At my friend’s insistence, I looked up the professor that would be teaching the class I wanted to take and made the same face that my friend had made just minutes before. Several students had left angry emoticon-filled comments warning me not to take the class, to avoid the professor at all means, to save myself and go a different route. Then I looked up my other professors, and what had once been the perfect schedule now seemed flawed, unpromising and downright scary. But I took a breather — how do I know that these ratings even apply to me? What if the professor that the students call “evil” becomes your best friend because you just so happen to be evil too? What if the angry raters thought the class was so terrible because they just couldn’t get their shit together that quarter?</p>\n<p>And so the problem presents itself: what is the right way to choose our classes? It’s as simple as looking at what you want to take, what you need to take and what works for you and your daily routine. Then craft your perfect schedule based off of that. Don’t worry too much if people say something is great or terrible, because outside opinions really shouldn’t be the ultimate determinant for which classes we end up choosing. Advice from our peers, blessings from upperclassmen and ratings from sites such as <em>ratemyprofessors.com</em> are all helpful in their own ways, so use them, but use them carefully. And the cold truth of it is that you could plan out your whole quarter perfectly, but when it comes down it, you really do need the odds to be forever in your favor to get everything you want. The last-minute registration panic does not extend the courtesy of preference; it’s more of a “So, I know I need to take bio this quarter, but that’s full and really, Anth 5 is almost a biology class” type of thing.</p>\n<p>At the end of it all, the more we stress about making the perfect schedule with the best professors and the most important classes, the more we waste our time and energy that we need for doing the best we can this quarter, because in the famous words of Sweet Brown, “Ain’t nobody got time for that.”</p>\n<p><em>Travis Zane is a first-year economics and accounting major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Dozens of news and media outlets have chosen to boycott the mascot and refer to the team as I just have — “the professional football team in D.C.” It’s because the name of the actual mascot is an outright slur that wouldn’t even be in the vocabulary of a decent person, were it not for its singular appearance in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Team owner Daniel Snyder is indifferent about the campaign, going as far as telling reporters to print the word “never” in capital letters when writing about the prospects of a name change. It’s a damning situation, but a surprisingly common one.</p>\n<p>However, some teams such as the Florida State Seminoles have gained acceptance from local First Nations people because of their particularly respectful representations.

The gaucho is an equivalent of the North American cowboy. The depiction we use is a cartoon and it’s comical, but definitely not in a good-natured way. In fact, it’s quite dehumanizing. The fact that we use cultural terms like this for a cheap gimmick to make money is as off-putting and disgusting to me as it is to see a bro decked out in stereotypical drunk Mexican threads on Halloween night in I.V.</p>\n<p>So I propose that either this institution set up a cultural exchange initiative with the people of the region most commonly associated with the gaucho, which would be quite educational and potentially eye-opening for most students, or that we change the name outright.</p>\n<p>I, for one, fully support the latter measure. We have even had a history of flirting with a name change, with the Cubs being the front-runner during our transition to the UC system way back when. I would love to be a Cub; it’s catchy, cute and cuddly, with a potential mean streak. It also beats getting the usual “WTF” reaction we get when telling people what our current mascot is.</p>\n<p>If this past weekend found you asking why Columbus Day is a legitimate thing after all the terrible things he did, it’s because the people in power really just don’t care. There’s too much at stake. But why not be thinkers? Why not be empathetic?

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, my professor gave my class some personal advice. To sum it up, he told us to choose our majors and aspire towards certain careers for one reason and one reason only: a love for the subject and an interest in the profession.</p>\n<p>Later, during our weekly section, one of my classmates challenged what our professor had said, telling him upfront that it was probably the worst advice she’d ever heard. While he thought that careers should be based off of interest and natural talent, she thought it was completely irresponsible and impractical to ignore the economic concerns that vary between different career paths. With our undergraduate education costing around $30,000 a year, she argued that students could not simply wait around for the subject that “clicks” with them; students were making the right, informed choice when choosing certain majors that led to higher incomes. Money, being one of the fabrics of our society, plays an important role in the decisions we make as pre-career, undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>Yet if money were to be the only thing we based our decisions off of, why wouldn’t we all be engineering majors? Besides the fact that I would probably drop out after the first quarter, there is also the underlying yearning shared by all of us whether we like it or not: we crave passion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We hear both sides every day: “Follow your dreams,” and, “Find your passion,” versus, “This market has really good job opportunities,” and, “This career will make you a lot of money.” In high school, you may have taken a test that assigns you the professional career that fits you best. My results told me that I would excel at being a wedding planner, and while I do enjoy planning events such as parties and dances, let’s be honest: I’d much rather crash a wedding than plan one.</p>\n<p>Then my counselor told me that I should major in English because I scored well on the AP Literature test and on the writing section of the SAT. However, to me, writing essays upon essays for the next four years sounded more like selling my soul than attending college (no offense, English majors).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that in these early years of young adulthood, most students aren’t sure of what their passion is yet. We want to find it, but we just don’t know how. And the one thing we’re sure of is that money is important, because it lets you live comfortably and escape the worries of not being able to sustain the lifestyle you desire.</p>\n<p>Coming out of high school without a clear vision of what path to take or which passion to pursue, many freshmen (including myself) respond to the words “jobs,” “money” and “opportunity” with open ears. Is that bad? My professor would argue yes and my classmate would argue no. I say to hell with both of them. Yes, financial security is an important factor when making decisions about your future. Yes, happiness is also an important factor when thinking about the job you’ll be doing for the next several decades. But do these two factors have to be seen on the opposite sides of the spectrum? To say, “Yes, definitely,” would be as ridiculous as UCSB’s ranking at No. 2 instead of No. 1 on Princeton Review’s Top Party Schools (seriously, what is the deal with that?).</p>\n<p>So what’s the best answer then? There isn’t one really, or at least not one that’s the same for all of us. Although “money can’t buy happiness,” it sure as hell can put a roof over your head and a nice warm meal on the table. However, how you get that money is completely up to you. Chasing a goal solely for the end amount of cash isn’t the best strategy in the book. No matter who you are or what you’re after, you’re going to want have fun while you chase whatever it is you decide to pursue. Sure, an engineering major might statistically be better off than a psychology major, but the world we live in wasn’t built by statisticians. And we wouldn’t be college students in the first place unless we adhered to the motto “#YOLO.”</p>\n<p>As young adults, the only way we’re sure to avoid the constant, pressing advice of those around us is by locking ourselves in our rooms and shutting off all human contact, something I’d strongly advise you against doing. The thing is, it’s a natural tendency for those older than us to warn us about the future based of their own experiences or observations. But it’s our job to decide which advice we’re going to listen to and which advice we’re going to throw into the lagoon. Most importantly, take to heart the advice that is going to further your own interests and passions. After all, today’s top scientists say that the only reason our lagoon smells so bad is from all of that rotten advice.</p>\n<p><em>Travis Zane is a first-year economics/accounting major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

As a result of the healthcare crisis in America, the I.V. clinic merged with two Santa Barbara-based clinics to form Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics, Inc. After a few years, the building was sold to keep SBNC afloat and Isla Vista’s community center was lost. At the time, this didn’t seem so disastrous because the County Redevelopment Agency planned to build a community center in I.V. However, because of the State’s fiscal crisis, all RDAs were dissolved before construction started out on Estero Road.</p>\n<p>Before its dissolution, the RDA purchased the clinic and church buildings intending to bulldoze them and build an immense underground parking lot. Needing 2/3rds-support of Park District voters, Measure D, which would have granted IVRPD the right to sell, lease or trade town parks, was instead defeated 3-1 in 2008. The County is left with the option of keeping the buildings “for government use” or selling them, perhaps to private developers.</p>\n<p>To their credit, the County board of supervisors supports keeping the two buildings but over the next year, the Park Board will be deciding just how much the District will be involved in the future of these properties.</p>\n<p>The Board has already stated the buildings should be the town’s much needed community center. But how is its staffing and maintenance to be paid for? And what if the State Finance Department insists the buildings should be sold? How will the Park Board prevent them from being demolished to make way for another high-rise apartment complex (with little or no parking)?</p>\n<p>Well, the reason I’m writing to the Daily Nexus is because there is a one-year term open on the Park Board, to which any I.V. resident registered to vote is eligible to be appointed. The newest member of the Park Board would have the opportunity to step into this historic brew of events and possibly have a sizable effect on Isla Vista’s future. This open position will be filled by vote of the other four board members at their public meeting, Nov. 14. The term expires at the next regular election, in November 2014.</p>\n<p>As it happens, the next Park Board meeting is showing The Isla Vista Slide Show, a sweeping history of the town emphasizing the 1970 civil disturbances and the community-building movement that rose phoenix-like out of those ashes. This double-barreled presentation inspired several generations of UCSB students to get involved in their community.

My professor had been speaking for 15 minutes but I hadn’t been listening at all. I was going through the motions of a responsible student, with my notes open, eyes attentive and head nodding, but none of her words reached my ears. Instead, I was consumed by a question that had been plaguing my thoughts and nagging at the very essence of my being for months: Why does Snoop Dogg (excuse me, Snoop Lion? Does anyone even know anymore?) love socks so much?</p>\n<p>It all started when I first followed Snoop on Instagram. Yes, that’s how familiar we are: I just call him “Snoop” now (#firstnamebasis). Snoop’s Instagram features awkwardly angled “selfies,” blunts, socks, Adidas gear and pictures of his kids. Let me describe a few of my favorite Instas:</p>\n<p>• A pair of slippers custom-embroidered with the words “Snoop Dogg,” a gold chain, G Pen vaporizer and a $2 bill, with the caption, “Essentials #slippergame #gpen.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>• One skinny foot sporting an orange, grey and black argyle sock, captioned, “Sock game!!

I’m happy fuck it long as the ice cream bomb n the kids like it I love it. Get ya hustle on!!! [sic]” (He’s really just an all-around family guy.)</p>\n<p>Within a week, I began sending out mass texts with daily updates on Snoop. At first my friends and family responded with similar enthusiasm, but one by one, they became disinterested as I continued to shove pictures of Snoop’s socks in their faces. At this point, I was just beginning to use the phrases, “Sock game!” and, “What it do, nephew?” in daily conversation.</p>\n<p>As I got deeper, I spent more and more time thinking about Snoop. How does he stay so cool? Why does a grown man smoke so much weed? Why hasn’t his daughter taught him how to take a better “selfie”? Why does he wear so much jewelry when he goes on vacations? Where can I get myself some Snoop slippers? And what is up with all the socks? Then, I started thinking I saw Snoop in airport terminals and bus stations. Is that man in the orange shirt actually just Snoop re-living his Extravaganza experience?</p>\n<p>I downloaded the Snoopify app (highly recommended) in order to better understand the Snoop mentality, but when I took my own “selfie” and tried to Snoopify it, there was nothing I could add to make it more Snoop-y. The Snoop-session had gone too far.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista and scholars of UC Santa Barbara, I am asking you to come to my aid. These unanswered questions have my mind spiraling out of control. This ardent love of Snoop Dogg has taken its toll. (See? I’m even writing in rap form now.) I only hope that if my questions are answered, I may finally be able to focus on my studies and continue a relatively normal life as a student and a friend. So seriously, guys, da fuck is up with all the socks?</p>\n<p><em>Risa Weber is a third-year communications major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

thing I remember from my Intro to Psychopathology course (and well, let’s be honest, there’s probably <i>only </i>one thing), it’s a brief discussion that I had with the instructor toward the end of our first lecture. I simply asked him, “Does anyone in the field have an issue with use of the word ‘disorder’? Presumably, every mental ‘disorder’ <i>does </i>have an inherent order and any ‘<i>dis</i>-order’ simply exists as a condition whose order is simply not as obvious to an outside observer.” My innocent inquiry was met with the following dismissive, unsatisfactory reply: “The word ‘disorder’ is just a placeholder, and everyone in the field knows that, so there’s certainly no issue.”</p>\n<p>Whoa, now — <i>au contraire, O wise professeur</i>! To be sure, there is <i>definitely </i>an issue here.

It’s not exactly a fun thing to do in and of itself (not for me, anyway). So why do I care so much about this term? Well, this particular case definitely reeked something fierce of a moral issue, but more importantly, it reflected the unfortunate tendency of even our most esteemed academics to throw around words that can actually do a great deal of harm<i> </i>to our understanding of the concepts they intend to define.</p>\n<p>Here’s a more well-known example of what I mean: We often hear the word “gay” thrown about by particularly ignorant/weak-minded folk, who use the word as if it were synonymous with “bad,” “undesirable” or “uncool.” For example: “Dude, that shirt is <i>so </i>gay.” Now, the common (albeit, poor) argument from these people when trying to justify their application of the term is that everyone who takes issue is either a) overreacting or b) misunderstanding their intentionally light use of the word. After all, these “well-meaning” fools might argue, “What better way to make a term meaningless and less negatively charged than to bring it into the realm of casual, everyday use?” When I think what you guys mean is, “What better way to strip a word of its <i>malicious </i>meaning by intentionally using it <i>wrongly, </i>perhaps even <i>mockingly</i>?”</p>\n<p>Nope, I’m not having it, your argument is invalid, “warning, warning, bad argument alert!”<i> </i>etc. The more a passive listener hears the word “gay” misapplied in these contexts, the more they’re going to subconsciously begin to associate it with its wrong use. Overuse and misapplication of the term really serve to change<i> </i>our conception of it such that it eventually comes to mean something entirely different. So when these lame wads bandy about with their lighthearted misuse of “gay” as if they’re on some sort of noble, god-sent mission to bring the word down from its socio-politically charged pedestal, what they’re <i>really </i>doing is altering the less aware passerby’s implicit understanding of the word. To the passerby, “gay” becomes “bad” or “undesirable,” rather than “naturally-occurring,” “morally valid” and so on.</p>\n<p>And while the misusers of the term hold the lion’s share of blame to begin with, the passive listeners in question here — the ones who “innocently” perpetuate the redefining of the word — must accept their share as well for being so oblivious to their surroundings. But I won’t go further into blame/responsibility and social unawareness for this article’s purposes.</p>\n<p>Bringing it all back to the arena of mental “disorders,” when this instructor tried to imply that I was being unnecessarily nitpicky about a term, I instead deduced the following — that he was grossly underestimating the social weight of a word, and that he really doesn’t appreciate how astray we can be led by applying inappropriate labels to naturally occurring psychological phenomena. “Gay” and<i> </i>“disorder” are frequently misused for the same underlying reason: Because instead of putting in a conscious effort to <i>understand </i>homosexuality or mental illnesses, we take them both to denote people or psychological conditions that are somehow <i>problems in themselves</i>. That is, “gay” equates to a host of poorly conceived sociopolitical beliefs and attitudes, and “disorder” equates to taking a member of society’s atypical psychology as having no inherent or valid “order” to speak of … when, by the way, there is indeed an order to everything in this universe, whether we choose to understand or ignore it.</p>\n<p>Instead of taking the time to understand the order<i> </i>of these naturally occurring and <i>valid</i> psychological conditions, we’d rather consider them inherent<i> </i>flaws<i>, </i>writing them off as unimportant enigmas to be dealt with some other day by someone else. And by going as far as to call the word “disorder” a “placeholder,” this professor proves my point: The misuse of these words is used as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for understanding our fellow human beings <i>now</i> so as to lazily put the task off until later, thus proving that the real disorder here lies in our failure to understand each mental atypicality — not<i> </i>in the atypicalities themselves.</p>\n<p><em>     Suraj Sood is a fourth-year psychology and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We began talking about the dating culture at each of our relative schools. He was looking for advice on how he was going to ask out a girl with whom he had been hooking up for three weeks. He wanted her for himself. He said he was going to take her out to a really nice, elaborate dinner. Then he asked, “Do you think I should ask her to be my girlfriend before, during or after the dinner?” I respond, “During.” But hell, what do I know? It’s not like I’ve ever been taken on a candlelit dinner throughout my three years in college. And neither have any of my five normal roommates.</p>\n<p>Here’s a story for you: It’s about a Boy with blue eyes and a Girl with brown hair. Boy and Girl had been friends for a while. One evening, Girl was hosting a party and Boy arrived. That evening, their friendship surpassed just friendship. Whenever you have sex with a friend for the first time, you move into precarious territory. Anyway, Boy needed to use the restroom in the middle of everything and upon return, decided to use the same condom as before. This was a flagrant turn-off for Girl, so she suggested that they both go to sleep. Three hours later, Girl awakened, turned to her side and noticed that Boy had enigmatically disappeared. “I just wanted to sleep in a bigger bed,” Boy texted her when she inquired where he had gone. Girl knew something was up, because Boy had slept over in her small bed many times before. Morning arrived, night arrived and the following day and week arrived … still no word from Boy.</p>\n<p>This story is just one of many that attest to the presence of letdowns, absences and avoidances that are oftentimes more hurtful than directness, all of which have been felt by a majority of females living in our community. So here’s my advice to you, boys: Try taking her out to dinner before unbuttoning her pants. Try holding her hand before asking for a blowjob.</p>\n<p>Here’s another way to put it: Guys, think of your sister. And if you don’t have a sister, imagine that you do. Would you want some guy treating her the same way you treat the girl you’re kissing?</p>\n<p>Don’t be so afraid that we’re going to shepherd you toward commitment. Our only want is for someone to treat us decently, to stay for the entirety of night when we make the request, to show facets of honesty and to walk us home when it’s dark outside and we were recently informed of a stabbing that took place on the 66 block of DP. After all, our hearts only bend so much.</p>\n<p><em>This article was submitted anonymously.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article appeared online only.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52330\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52330\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/","id":5886,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[5885,5884,5883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Government Shutdown : It Is Your Problem","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Letter to the Editor: Third-year political science major Mckinley Krongaus tells you why the government shutdown is really everyone's problem.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1981909873\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52302\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52303\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/why-being-offended-should-be-a-thing-of-the-past/white-house-north-2007-dj/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?fit=534%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"534,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"white-house-north-2007-dj\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?fit=534%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52303\" alt=\"white-house-north-2007-dj\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?resize=534%2C374\" width=\"534\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/white-house-north-2007-dj.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>For those of you who aren’t aware (I know most of you aren’t, so don’t lie), our government is currently shut down. This hasn’t happened in 17 years. We all attend a public university, and we all are of legal voting age, so yeah, I would say it is pretty damn important that you all know how/why this is happening and just how unnecessary it is. Before I begin, let me just clarify a few things. Yes, I am a Democrat, (for those of you who are still reading, thank you). Yes, I have “Barack/Biden 2008,” “Women for Obama 2012,” “Jews love Obama,” and my personal favorite: “I’m Ready For Hillary” stickers plastered on both my laptop and guitar case. Yes, I am a political science major and therefore think that it is only common sense that every 18-22 year old undergraduate college student should be at least minimally up to date on the political goings on of our country. But, more importantly, I am an American, and the actions of our political leaders right now are laugh-worthy.</p>\n<p>To those of you who don’t believe that healthcare is a universal right, I respect your opinion. I will never in my life understand that thought process, but I will respect it nonetheless. And to those who believe that insurance companies scam hardworking families and abandon those who are suffering, I am with you, but that is beside the point… The moral of the story is that members of the Republican Party are throwing a tantrum equivalent to those of the 5-year old boy I nanny, Benjamin. When we were playing Chutes and Ladders, one night, I told Benjamin that he actually rolled only a two, not a five, and could therefore not climb the ladder to the finish line. He proceeded to kick the board over, throw the dice in my face, and lock himself in his room. These actions, of course, earned him a scolding. The concerning part is that these same actions are, right now, earning the House Republicans their paychecks…</p>\n<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or what my buddy “Almost President Mitt” lovingly coined “Obamacare”), is a 100 percent Supreme Court certified constitutional bill that was signed into effect by President Obama on March 23, 2010. I am not debating any of the details of the Act as I only have about 127 characters left, not 185,271,198. But the bill was passed. And just as Jon Stewart reminded us on “The Daily Show” with the Schoolhouse Rock clip, “I’m Just a Bill,” once a bill is introduced, voted on by both the House and the Senate, and then signed by the President of the United States, it is law. There are no “if”s, “and”s or “but”s about it — read The Constitution. Yet the Republicans have tried over 37 times in the past three years to repeal the bill and have now vowed to lock themselves in their bedrooms (continuing to be paid while doing so) until the Democrats come over, knock on the door quietly, and say “I’m sorry, you actually did roll a five. You won the game of Chutes and Ladders!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I am not trying to say that there is one group of people to blame for our country’s situation. We definitely did not get to this point sporadically. But the facts remain that Republican Congressmen/women refuse to approve our national spending budget until the enactment of ACA is delayed a year. This collective action has left more than 800,000 federal workers furloughed, closed all of our national parks and monuments, and most importantly makes it impossible for me to live stream Mei Xiang, one of the pandas at the National Zoo, and watch her sit nearly motionless while she eats her breakfast bamboo (okay the last one was not serious, but to some it may be!).</p>\n<p>Write to your representatives and senators and encourage them to stop taking pay while they hide behind their weak political tactics and allow their citizens to suffer (this applies to those of all political affiliation). Let them know that you, a young college student, think that their actions are embarrassing and immature. And, on Nov. 4, 2014 get out and VOTE. Our Congress has a 10 percent approval rating, so yeah, it’s fair to say “they suck.” But guess who elected them? This is when you feel guilty about your political participation or lack thereof. In our last congressional election, 90 percent of the incumbents who ran were reelected. So before you run your mouth about how stupid Congress is, or even worse, how none of this is relevant to you, learn about how we got to where we are and do something to help us all figure out how we can move past it together, as a country — not as two parties crammed onto one piece of land. Just to bring it home, 7.5 million American children are living without any form of health insurance. Does that leave a good taste in your mouth?</p>\n<p><em>Mckinley Krongaus is a third-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

At UCSB, everyone can find their niche. Now, I don’t want to overwhelm anyone any more than the RHA’s 30-plus Welcome Week events already have. Between the blue and yellow posters engulfing the walls of your Res Hall’s lobby, the chaos of the dinning commons and what feels like hundreds of people handing out fliers at the Arbor, it’s easy to get intimidated.  But don’t let the hype scare you away.</p>\n<p>In high school, we all had our “thing,” whether it was ASB, volleyball, water polo, band, choir … the list goes on and on. If you found something you were passionate about in high school, you can certainly continue to participate in it here. Or maybe you were that over-committed, over-involved student who just wants the chance to finally take a load off. That was me last year; I was like, “Okay, I’m in college, I can do whatever I want now, I don’t have to do any clubs, I don’t have to play a sport, I’m just gonna chill.” But while that was fun for a while, I have to say my UCSB experience was highly enhanced the quarter that I started taking advantage of more of the exciting opportunities that we have on campus.</p>\n<p>Get involved in your hall because it’s one of the best ways to meet people. If you’re on the fence about whether you want to help out or not, just go to the info sessions! Whether you’re in one of the shorties, like Anacapa or Santa Cruz, or over in San Cat, being involved in things like Hall Council will introduce you to a variety of people in your building. Even if Hall Council doesn’t sound like your thing, you should definitely check out some of the programs your peers will put on throughout the year.

Intramurals give you a fun atmosphere where you can let out that competitive streak that all Gauchos naturally possess … plus, who knows how to celebrate a win better than a Gaucho? There’s also a whole array of club sports that offer everyone a fairly even playing field (no pun intended), such as rowing, rugby or lacrosse, which maybe aren’t the standard fare that was offered at your high school, but should certainly be given a shot.</p>\n<p>As you walk through the Arbor or past the UCen this week, there will be clubs, groups and teams tabling that you’ll see and think, “Hmm, sounds pretty cool.” Do not ignore this thought! Stop and chat, find out when they meet and give it a shot. You never know when and where you might discover your hidden talent, or meet your future best friend, mentor, boss, study buddy, significant other … the options are unlimited.
