In Spring 2018, I was elected by 3,665 UCSB undergraduate students — roughly 17.7 percent of the student body and the most votes any single candidate has received in a contested race in the history of ASUCSB elections.

To my knowledge, Internal Vice Presidents in the past arguably have not taken as much effort as I have to physically attend these meetings and represent Associated Students to its fullest capacity on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, as the Internal Vice President I also chair the Associated Students Committee on Honoraria, where I have to process every single request for monetary compensation that is submitted by every BCU member, executive office member and entity chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being the representative for student on-campus and university affairs and chairing the Committee on Honoraria, I also serve as the presiding officer and chair of the Associated Students Senate where I manage 24 student senators and at-large student representatives to the three senate standing committees. Doing so, I maintain parliamentary procedure and create the weekly senate agendas as well as review the minutes to every board, commission and unit that operates within the Associated in order to ensure they are par with the Associated Students Legal Code. Lastly, I process 50+ weekly on a day-to-day basis solely on Associated Students, Campus and University Affairs, yet nobody other than myself and the individuals who have held my seat before are aware of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an executive officer of Associated Students, I also have the honor and privilege to work with 10 of the most amazing and driven individuals on campus in my office who are committed to enhancing the well being of students at the university level. This entails yet more meetings and task delegation including but not limited to facilitating the Fall Associated Students Kelly Pearman Executive Fellowship, holding weekly office meetings and executing officewide projects and responsibilities. All of these add to my duties of being the chair of senate, chair of Committee on Honoraria and representing student on-campus committees and boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the points stated in the editorial,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) The clause stated the public posting of Office Hours also states under it: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Executive Director or designee shall be responsible for posting office hours on the respective door, the A.S. website, posting the respective office hours next to the photo portraits of the ASUCSB elected officials that are placed in the University Center, and for sending out a university-wide email to all students with the names of all elected and appointed ASUCSB officials and their respective office hours by the end of the (3rd) third week of each quarter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I assume the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> self-nominated myself as the designee or assumed I was the Executive Director of Associated Students which I am not. Past Internal Vice Presidents have also never compiled a master list of senators’ office hours, yet I am doing so this quarter and will do so for the rest of the year as a part of my platform for transparency that I ran on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) “They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowhere in the Associated Students legal code says that a Senate bill database needs to be established, and as part of my platform for transparency, I made it upon myself to establish it this year as precedent for future Internal Vice Presidents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) “They demanded </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBL</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBL</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– had every right to record.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators during the meeting did not consent to being filmed at the time of the livestream which is completely within their right to privacy, and it was during a time where minutes were not to be recorded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4) “Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators and myself do not even have the ability to personally update the Associated Students website, so the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> assuming that we do is a complete misunderstanding of what we can do as elected officials, as bureaucratic processes still apply to these student leaders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I am also a first-generation Southeast Asian student on this campus double majoring in a BS in Biological Sciences and a BA in Asian American Studies. I take 16 units a quarter in order to graduate on time so that I can receive two degrees from the prestigious undergraduate institution which is UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like all elected officials within Associated Students, I am a student first and leader second. If we need to take time to have a mental-health break or destress from what our lives entail, then we will and that should not be ridiculed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because I take the time to acknowledge that my position is more than just being the chair of the Associated Students Senate but also a main representative of undergraduate interests at the campus and university level does not mean that others can only see my duties as controlling one aspect of the association when it is simply not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wants to judge the two posts on my twitter account and a private snapchat story then they can, but never will I let an individual, group or entity assume and say that I do not take my job seriously because I understand the privilege and work that holding an executive officer position in Associated Students, let alone being the Internal Vice President, entails.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I truly believe what you’re doing as a board is honorable, meaningful and worthwhile. I want to emphasize that my leadership is student-centered. Moving forward, I hope that Associated Students as a whole and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can work past personal conflicts in order to work together toward a better UC Santa Barbara campus by both serving and informing the student body in a manner that prioritizes the students who voted me into office and pay into running our student-led press. This can be a learning experience, just as was stated in the article, and in the future I would be more than willing to have my office work with yours in assuring accountability, transparency and ensuring that student leaders are properly recognized for their work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincerely,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven

midterm election has been on the top of my mind for awhile now. Nov. 6 is in the hands of young people and we should be both excited and anxious to turn the tide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students, we need representatives that are going to hear our voices and let them roar on the congress floor. Congressman Salud Carbajal, like myself and thousands of other Gauchos, relied on financial aid and student loans to graduate from UCSB. Salud Carbajal stands up for students — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he has supported Senator Warren’s Bank on Student’s Act to allow students like me to refinance their student loan debt. He has also co-sponsored legislation for the Federal Government to partner with states to provide free community college tuition to all students for two years. He introduced legislation to increase the value of Pell </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grants, near</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ly doubling the max award to $9,650. Salud is also a strong advocate for codifying Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors on college campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos, do not be complacent. Be bold and intentional with your ballot.

First of all, the UC doesn’t hold enough investments in any one company to significantly influence companies via its shares. Second, this tactic has been tried, and in this case, companies will not listen to a shareholder engagement strategy that asks them to forgo their bottom line and completely restructure their business model.</p>\n<p>Claim 2: “Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations.” Many critics of divestment keep conveniently forgetting that the goal of divestment is not about shifting the money and starving the industry of stock value, but rather about the immense cultural shift that results from a respected and powerful institution like the UC deciding to no longer invest in companies that are threatening the futures of the students of their intuition. Making such a claim erases the history that divestment played in bringing on the end of apartheid in South Africa, in pushing the UC to no longer be a passive observer of human rights abuses but to instead stand against white supremacy. On Nelson Mandela’s first visit to the United States after being released from prison he thanked the students at UC Berkeley for their roles in the divestment from apartheid movement. Finally, the tobacco divestment campaign played a crucial role in the public relations struggle over the health impacts of tobacco and directly helped shift cultural norms around smoking. Today, thanks to the cultural shift divestment brought about, it would be scandalous for a university to invest in tobacco.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Claim 3: “The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy.” The fossil fuel industry exists to meet its bottom line. This industry is responsible for oil trains which have derailed and killed innocent bystanders; for increased rates of asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular illness in communities living near power plants; for the mass disregard for people whose livelihoods depends on their environment, as seen with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the destruction of native lands for the production of tar sands, and the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We cannot claim that these companies exist for the public good when Exxon created a massive disinformation campaign, hiring Big Tobacco’s top PR firms to discredit the best climate scientists. Why, exactly, should the UC be investing in that level of destruction?</p>\n<p>Claim 4: “We must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve…” I applaud this point and the divest-invest movement has garnered so much public support because it doesn’t only focus on what is bad, but also actively pursues investment alternatives into climate justice solutions. This includes investing in community choice energy, education, and renewable startups. As a society, we need to get better at articulating our vision for what kind of world we want to live in; we need to divest from the problem and invest in the solutions.</p>\n<p>Claim 5: “On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age.” Fracking has no place in the low-carbon, just transition that we need as a society. The technology was developed to extract the little remaining oil and gas from nearly depleted wells and has been linked to increases in the frequency of earthquakes, the contamination and waste of precious groundwater, and the destruction of local economies in the boom and bust cycle. Moreover, the fuels being extracted by fracking are still contributing to the climate crisis: natural gas releases methane which, while having a shorter atmospheric residence time, has a stronger global warming potential than carbon dioxide, and in California, fracking is used to extract dense, tar-like oil that releases far more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.</p>\n<p>Claim 6: “UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers.” This statement is absolutely true. Investments in fossil fuels are risky because much of the industry’s reserves will become stranded assets, and hence financially unviable, leading to what experts in the field call a “carbon bubble” when appropriate climate legislation is finally introduced. The UC’s responsibility and its mission – both to the students who must be forced to live with the consequences of climate change, and the people of California who have overwhelmingly demanded climate action – should be aligned with its investment practices.</p>\n<p>How, then, can the UC defend actively investing in companies that are driving climate change which has been attributed by brilliant climate scientists to contributing to the California drought, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Sandy, all bearing heavy costs for this country?</p>\n<p>Students have been actively lobbying for fossil fuel divestment since August 2012, have sat in closed-door meetings with Chancellors, Regents, investment officers, and sustainability officers, and have garnered the support of over 700 faculty UC-wide, 9 A.S. senate resolutions, 3 Academic Senate resolutions, and now the support of 4 Chancellors. Suggesting that the campaign should focus more on being “constructive” and “lobby” instead of using civil disobedience ignores the entire history of the campaign.</p>\n<p>But I don’t blame Prisco for buying into that idea. Our history books have an unfortunate tendency of tidying up how real transformation happens. Systemic change – such as civil rights, the New Deal, and women’s suffrage – doesn’t happen because a group of people politely sit down in a meeting with key decision makers. It happens because those who dare to dream negotiate and demonstrate until human and environmental rights are achieved.</p>\n<p>The fossil fuel industry owns five times more coal, oil, and gas than even the most conservative climate scientists suggest is safe to burn, meaning that 80% of fossil fuels must remain below ground if we are to have any chance of avoiding climate catastrophe. Combatting climate change and the catastrophic poisoning of our communities, water, air, and land has no easy solution. Meaningful change is a long and bumpy road, and Chancellor Yang, accompanied by the chancellors from UCSC, UCSD, and UCD, should be applauded for making bold commitments that are appropriate for the severity of the crises we face. While divestment won’t solve the climate crisis nor repay those who have been sacrificed in the name of cheap energy, it is a meaningful catalyst for change.</p>\n<p><em>Emily Williams is a graduate student in Geography.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/","id":6261,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6260,6259,6258],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why UCSB Should Not Divest From Fossil Fuels","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Graduate student Nathan Prisco weighs in on the issue of the University's divestment from fossil fuels. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As future leaders, we all have a responsibility to do what we can to advocate for solutions to climate change. With approximately $3 billion invested, the University of California system is in a powerful position to influence the fossil fuel industry as an important shareholder. When one divests on moral or ideological grounds, one guarantees that the assets will be controlled and managed by a new party that cares less about the ideas and morals that led to the divestment. In the United States, the boards of directors of public corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to seek profits for the common shareholders. If the owners (shareholders) of the fossil fuel industry do not care about climate change, the companies are legally obligated to similarly not care. Rather than divest, the UC system should exercise its role as a prominent shareholder to pressure fossil fuel companies to adopt more forward-looking policies to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations. In the past, there was a national effort to divest from the tobacco industry due to the known public health consequences of tobacco consumption. Aside from negative publicity, divestment efforts were largely inconsequential. In fact, depressing an industry’s stock prices due to large-scale divestment tends to boost the return on equity available to the remaining shareholders through more effective share buybacks and dividend reinvestment; Philip Morris (now Altria) was one of the highest returning stocks of the past 50 years. The real success of the anti-tobacco movement in the United States, aside from public smoking bans, arose from targeted health advocacy to disseminate information on the negative health effects of smoking.</p>\n<p>The energy industry contains some of the world’s most highly qualified scientists, skilled workers and engineers who work on the most challenging problems of our generation. The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy. For the first time, we are beginning to see renewable energy emerge as a viable large-scale commercial option. Our generation is accustomed to rapid progress and is understandably frustrated by the snail’s pace of the energy sector. However, the energy grid is comprised of hundreds of billions of dollars of existing infrastructure and has been developed for over a hundred years; it is not amenable to rapid change.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moreover, as an educated student body, we must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve and view the energy sector with long-term objectives. For instance, the Obama administration opposed the expansion of many activities such as the use of Canadian oil sands, coal power generation and oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean because these activities have a relatively high environmental impact. On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age. In fact, the United States’ carbon emissions declined by 12 percent from 2005 to 2015, due to the increased use of natural gas over coal for power generation. </p>\n<p>A recent article in the Daily Nexus claimed that Chancellor Henry T. Yang has endorsed Fossil Free UCSB in its calls for divestment. His statement has been misconstrued; he did offer his support to the activists, but he did not explicitly endorse a divestment from fossil fuel industries.<br>\n“I stand by our students who have been sitting in calling for fossil fuel divestment this past week and support their aims … In the coming week, I look forward to working with my fellow chancellors in support of a thorough and transparent discussion on divestment from fossil fuels as part of the UC’s approach to combating the climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>It is encouraging to see an administrator engaged with the student body, although his response leaves much to be desired. As a highly qualified engineer and scientist, Chancellor Yang could use this opportunity as a teaching moment to provide more direction to the activists. Under President Donald J. Trump, research institutions and regulatory agencies are under assault, and now more than ever we need common-sense actions on climate change. Above all, I commend the organizers of Fossil Free UCSB for their impressive achievement and successful display of civil disobedience, but I suggest a more constructive approach. Lobby for new policy to clarify the UC system’s relationship with fossil fuel industries, and engage the regents to commit strongly to climate advocacy in their capacity as shareholders. This includes advocating for increased funding of renewable energy initiatives and fundamental research at our universities and national laboratories, improved regulatory oversight for fracking wastewater disposal and other pollutants and a “revenue-neutral” tax on carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>Even if it otherwise makes sense to divest, the chancellors must consider the impact divestment is likely to have on our community. The UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers to effectively manage its resources in pursuit of its strategic mission. Divestment on moral grounds reduces the universe of potential investments, and this can only decrease the returns available to the overall portfolio. Can the chancellors demonstrate that the opportunity cost of divesting from fossil fuels does not significantly impact the growth of our system’s endowment or the quality of our institution?<br>\nNathan Prisco is a second-year graduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB.

For example, had BDS been brought up at UCLA again this year or next, it would have likely been defeated. Just because it passed once years ago doesn’t mean that UCLA supports BDS. The UC Regents have already stated that boycotting Israel is discriminatory and they will not divest — period.</p>\n<p>Next, the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement is anti-Semitic. The Anti-Defamation League — the authoritative voice on anti-Semitic activity and one that the article cited — stated that BDS is designed to undermine Israel’s existence. Saying that the Jewish state does not have a right to exist is anti-Semitic, and the Jewish community, both here at UCSB and worldwide, has overwhelmingly agreed with that assertion. It should be up to the Jewish community, and the Jewish community only, to define what anti-Semitism is on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>We can judge the BDS movement’s intentions through quotes by the founder of the movement, Omar Barghouti. He believes that Israel “will be renamed Palestine,” ending the existence of the nation-state of the Jewish people. Advocating for the eradication of the Jewish state is anti-Semitic, against the two-state solution and supported by the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>On the more nuanced scale of criticizing the isolation of Israel, which the article dismisses as “shifting focus,” this is an old anti-Semitic trope. BDS isolates the Jewish state, a unitary emblem of the Jewish people, and uses that isolation to economically strangle it. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious anti-Semitic conspiracy document, did the same thing. It isolated the Jews and made them the face of global corruption.</p>\n<p>The BDS movement does the same, pretending Israel is the global face of oppression, co-opting causes and arguing that taking down the Israeli regime is tantamount to fighting for global justice. It grants no other country such vitriolic treatment.</p>\n<p>Just this week, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had incredibly harsh words for Israel in an interview with AJ+, signed a letter along with all 100 U.S. Senators, to the United Nations, demanding a cessation of isolating and condemning only Israel. He also went on to declare that he does not support the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>You’ll often hear pro-BDS activists say that it is OK to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic. This is absolutely true. Israelis are incredibly critical of Israel, and recent polls show that a stark majority are in favor of a two-state solution. However, the BDS movement goes far beyond that.</p>\n<p>It is a campaign of de-legitimization, demonization and an abhorrent double standard employed against the only Jewish state. This makes it anti-Semitic. If I, as a Jewish student, have to stand at a wall and defend not just the country that my grandparents sought refuge in when they were exiled from Morocco for being Jewish but also my core identity as a Jew, then this movement is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>If I have to look at the words “anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism” and feel attacked, silenced and marginalized, then this movement is anti-Semitic. Zionism is the right to self-determination for the Jewish people. That is all it is. If this movement is against the right to self-determination for only the Jewish people, then it is the opposite of progressive.</p>\n<p>I can speak for a large majority of the Jewish community on campus and say that we stand for a two-state solution. We stand for fair and equitable treatment for the Palestinians. We stand for peace. BDS does not stand for peace. We do not stand for BDS.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/why-ucsb-should-not-divest-from-israel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/why-ucsb-should-not-divest-from-israel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/why-ucsb-should-not-divest-from-israel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/why-ucsb-should-not-divest-from-israel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/why-ucsb-should-not-divest-from-israel/","id":6259,"author":{"id":647,"name":"Gefen Laredo"},"related":[6258,6257,6256],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vote Yes on Measure O!","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Ethan Bertrand discusses Measure O, its impacts on Isla Vista residents, and why he believes you should vote Yes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello! I’m Ethan Bertrand, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District and former director of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District* (IVRPD). I’m writing today to urge Isla Vista residents to vote YES on Measure O this spring to invest in the continued excellence of our treasured parks, open spaces and recreational programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For over 40 years, the IVRPD has been a partner in making Isla Vista the special place it is.  Born out of the environmental movement in the 1970s, our park district has preserved natural resources through the establishment of a unique network of neighborhood parks, the efforts of the Adopt-a-Block cleanup program and the use of organic maintenance methods. Committed to building relationships between community members, the park district co-sponsors Isla Vista’s best community events, leads an engaging Children’s Recreation Program and oversees an accessible community garden program. All of us are so lucky to benefit from the work of the IVRPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large amount of service the park district provides is made possible by the grants, collaboration with other organizations and long-term investment of generations of Isla Vista residents. The park district receives most of its funding from bedroom taxes approved by voters in 1997. In consideration of the financial positions of I.V. residents, the IVRPD has worked diligently to provide services without raising taxes. In fact, the park district hasn’t asked voters for additional funding in almost 20 years. Today, friends of the IVRPD realize the need for a greater investment from the community to meet the the desires of residents and pay for long-overdue park and facility maintenance.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By voting YES on Measure O and approving a $28.75 annual bedroom tax for 10 years, you will make sure our park district can continue to keep our community green, enhance the quality of life in Isla Vista and support the vibrant nature of the paradise we get to call home. Generating approximately $2,500,000 for the park district over the next 10 years, funding from Measure O may be used to bring recycled water to the parks, pay for outdoor exercise equipment, establish a dog park, expand recreational programs for all Isla Vista residents and fund many other innovative projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust me, I understand that “tax” can be a scary word. Luckily, I have good news for you. Until the 2015-2016 school year, property owners (and their renters) were paying the same amount of money per bedroom to pay off a bond. This means that for most of us residents, there will be no increase in the amount of park district taxes and fees we have gotten used to paying. This election will be conducted through the use of mail-in ballots. Ballots will be mailed to the addresses of registered voters in Isla Vista beginning April 10. After marking YES on Measure O, be sure to place your ballot in the mail immediately. The last day for mail-in ballots to be postmarked is May 9. To avoid forgetting to vote or misplacing your ballot, I highly recommend voting at your earliest convenience.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks make life better, so I hope you will join my friends and I in voting YES on Measure O.

We would like to take a chance to make the case publicly for why this is a big deal for Isla Vista, as board members on the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC). A community center by itself, admittedly, doesn’t do anything, but it acts as a hub for all residents of Isla Vista to channel their culture, knowledge and creativity. Most towns even smaller than ours have something like this. People use it as an opportunity to host events, teach or take classes or simply as a place for the community to meet.</p>\n<p>While the Pardall Center is a great facility, the building’s space just does not fit the bill for a hub of community-wide activity. Studying late at the Pardall Center and taking advantage of the free printing for that report due tomorrow is one thing; teaching 30 people how to bake a chocolate cake is another. Meeting with your group to prepare that PowerPoint presentation is what the Pardall Center is made for, but bilingual household finance classes that help you balance a checkbook and build your credit? We’re gonna need a bigger building (and probably a projector with a screen, ample seating, a PA system and maybe even a stage). That same infrastructure can help a student find their passion by teaching a dance class to local youth, and later that evening the space could become a warming center for those in the area facing homelessness and cold nights outside.</p>\n<p>We are also both part of the Santa Barbara Progressive Coalition that meets at La Casa de la Raza in the Eastside neighborhood of Santa Barbara. There are constant karate and dance classes, a demonstration cooking kitchen, band practices and family events while our meeting is happening; it truly feels like the community is alive and thriving. A similar facility in Isla Vista would do so much to amplify the culture of Isla Vista by providing a central public space for us to come together to express ourselves, learn and develop bonds within the community.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the summer of 2013, Isla Vistans from many generations — along with Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr and Associated Students — convinced the State of California Department of Finance not to sell the property at 970 and 976 Embarcadero del Mar. These are commonly referred to as the I.V. Clinic Building and old church building. During the 2015-2016 county budget process, I.V. residents along with Farr successfully lobbied for $485,000 in grants to renovate the 976 old church building and open it for public use as the Isla Vista Community Center, while the clinic building opened as the Community Resource Building.</p>\n<p>With the funding secured, the community began a visioning process to design the space, but all of the funds could only allow the building to be brought up to code with no improvements. That is why the IVCDC strongly supports the County of Santa Barbara in its application for a $1.1 million grant from the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development. If the County secures the grant, we believe the funds should be directed at fully realizing the potential of the Isla Vista Community Center with substantial community involvement in the improvement.</p>\n<p>On March 11, we’re going to host a celebration and kickoff event for the Isla Vista Community Center fundraising campaign. We invite past Isla Vistans from every generation, local bands and businesses and, of course, all the residents of Isla Vista, students and families. Join us then for a day celebrating Isla Vista’s rich history and culture before getting to work on finally making this a reality. The event will be from 3-6 p.m. at the Biko House, 6612 Sueno Rd.

Mindfulness, according to UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center, is “the moment-by-moment process of actively and openly observing one’s physical, mental and emotional experiences.” Practicing mindfulness has proven to lead to significant positive health effects including stress reduction, improved concentration and a better understanding of thoughts and feelings. These benefits would greatly improve the quality of life for many UCSB students and would help them deal with the everyday challenges of a college lifestyle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a high stress level is one of the most ubiquitous issues among college students, and it can lead to many negative health effects like illness, anxiety and depression. According to the 2015 National College Health Assessment, 53.5 percent of college students reported feeling “more than average stress” or “tremendous stress” over the span of the year. Practicing mindfulness is a useful tool to manage this large amount of stress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By training one’s mind to concentrate on one topic at a time, it helps sort the constant stream of thoughts and tasks that clutter our minds each day. Though many students already have tools to cope with stress, I encourage the adoption of mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. It goes beyond stress reduction, with the potential to improve things like focus, empathy, relationship satisfaction, immune function and emotional responsiveness instead of emotional reaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Additionally, in a recent mindful meditation lunch sponsored by the Women’s Center, Christina McMahon of the UCSB Department of Theater and Dance discussed the idea of compassion and kindness toward one’s self. She conveyed that studies have shown that you are more likely to show deeper compassion and kindness to others if you are compassionate toward yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an aspect of mindfulness that I truly want to highlight. Being compassionate toward yourself often times proves much more difficult than displaying compassion to others. It is easy for us as students to become absorbed with academic goals, extracurricular activities, work etc., and even easier to beat ourselves up when we don’t meet expectations. Thus, learning to embrace who we are and where we are in life will not only improve our quality of life, but the quality of life for our community as well as. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindful meditation, in many ways, can help students make more meaningful connections to themselves and others, grow as individuals and thrive in daily life. This is why Health &amp; Wellness is dedicated to providing students the opportunity to practice guided mindful meditation at least two times a week. Our Community Mindfulness Practices are led by mindfulness experts from the Santa Barbara and Goleta community, including Dawa Tarchin Phillips and Spencer Sherman. Additionally, one Community Mindfulness Practice per week incorporates a focus on social justice, which allows students to learn how to apply mindfulness to advocating for social change in their communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unfamiliar with mindfulness or meditation, each Community Mindfulness Practice lasts one hour and begins with a short dharma talk. These talks span approximately five minutes and introduce the topic of mindfulness meditation to students, outlining what to expect. The next 15-20 minutes consist of a meditation where the community expert guides you through the process, allowing you to expand your mindfulness skills. Finally, the hour is wrapped up with a discussion about the experience, whether it was good or bad and how it personally affected those who participated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any and all students interested in mindfulness are welcome to join Health &amp; Wellness in these Community Mindfulness Practices on Tuesdays in the SRB Student Conference Room from 1:05-1:50 p.m. or Fridays in South Hall, Room 1632 from 1-2 p.m. The events are a secular, safe space for all to come and enjoy an hour of tranquil reflection and discussion. Light snacks and beverages will also be provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These Community Mindfulness Practices are a great resource for any student looking for a way to improve their mental, emotional or physical well-being. I encourage all students to leave their predispositions at the door and see what mindfulness can do for you. It truly is for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><em>Carly Bertolozzi is an intern for UCSB’s Health and Wellness Programs.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/","id":6229,"author":{"id":648,"name":"Carly Bertolozzi"},"related":[6228,6227,6226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dear Regent Sherman, Whose Side are You On?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Casey Mix questions the UC's commitment to divesting from fossil fuels and sets an ultimatum for Regent Sherman.

That being said, it is estimated that of the said 9 billion dollars, roughly 3 billion is invested in big oil and gas companies, a rough estimate, of course, because the UC’s office has refused to disclose the exact amount. Feel free to confirm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to note that in September 2015, after two years of pressure from UC students, the UC sold off roughly 200 million dollars worth of coal and tar sands investments, a remarkable achievement. And though I don’t want to take away from the significance of said divestiture, I’d argue it’s becoming a monotonous statistic, appearing in every UC school paper’s article about divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re clinging onto it. We can no longer beat our chests, and the 200 million dollars can no longer be a “look what we did!” boast. If we want to talk numbers, it was 7 percent of the estimated 3 billion dollars. We still invest 2.8 billion dollars in fossil fuels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to quickly note that following the 200-million-dollar divestment, the UC’s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bacher was quoted saying, “</span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">institutions that ignore societal values in their investment strategy imperil their bottom line </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today and for years to come.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is time for us all to admit that investments in oil and gas companies fundamentally ignore our societal values. If you haven’t yet, I encourage you to read the article. Here’s the link: </span><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/17/beyond-divestment/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The irony is remarkable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re a school system that takes great pride in our efforts to be green, efficient leaders in sustainability and renewable energy, from what we study in the classroom to the classroom itself. We also take immense pride in our diversity. We take pride in embracing all races, sexes, religions and ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We are taught to abhor discrimination, eliminate pollution and help build a brighter future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the university I received an email from on Nov. 9 attempting to comfort me and remind me of my on-campus safe space locations, to reassure me the UC cherishes its diversity and in no way condones racism, sexism, misogyny, etc. voluntarily supports an industry that actively discriminates against, takes advantage of, pollutes and destroys marginalized communities within our state, across our country and around the world. Investments in fossil fuels stand against everything the UC stands for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a fourth-year environmental studies student here at UCSB. I am and will forever be grateful to my parents and this university for the opportunities they have given me — to study, learn and grow as a person here. I take pride in my university, my home for the last four years. I take pride in my major, my involvement in Fossil Free UCSB and the knowledge I have gained from the amazing courses and thought-provoking, incredible professors here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want future generations of students to encounter what I have been so fortunate to experience. Regrettably, I would argue that because of our unsustainable investments in fossil fuels, this experience is in jeopardy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It simply puzzles me that all of this pride and leadership finds itself invested in industries we as a university educate and stand against. Nearly 700 UC faculty members have signed a petition stating investments in fossil fuels are no longer acceptable. Three UC faculty senates and six associated student senates, representing hundreds of faculty and tens of thousands of students, have called upon the UC to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just last week UCSB’s own student senate has reaffirmed its commitment to fossil fuel divestment. I know it will not be easy, and I know it cannot happen overnight, but we must begin the process of full divestment from fossil fuels. If we want to take pride in something — if we want to be leaders in something — let it be that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Sherman, Fossil Free UCSB has presented you with a choice. You can stand with students, our future and all the values of this great university and divest from fossil fuels. Or you can stand with oil and gas companies, who threaten not only my future and future generations but also communities up and down the state of California today. What you can’t do is both. So I will ask again: Whose side are you on?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope you will not only stand with us, but act. We must not do what is easy, but what is right. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ball is in your court, Regent Sherman.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the sake of the environment, animal welfare and nutrition, UCSB students should reduce their meat consumption, and the university should foster a trend toward plant-based diets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The environmental impact of animal agriculture is astounding. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concludes that 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions result from animal agriculture. By comparison, the EPA attributes 14 percent of emissions to all global transportation systems combined. Our diets clearly have a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">huge </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact on the planet. In a seminal life-cycle impact assessment, Reijnders and Soret estimated the environmental impact of non-vegetarian meals to be between 1.5 and 2 times worse than vegetarian meals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the urgency of climate change, reducing meat consumption matters even more. The FAO reports that because of belches and manure, livestock accounts for 25 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions. Methane’s half-life in the atmosphere is eight years, compared to 100 years for carbon dioxide, so methane reduction offers a quicker route to curb global warming in the short-term. That is why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that methane’s Global Warming Potential is 86 times greater than carbon dioxide’s.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing meat consumption also offers nutritional benefits. Though both plant-based and omnivorous diets are only healthy with deliberate effort, it is uncontroversial that most people eat too much meat. According to Johns Hopkins University, the average American eats 50 percent more meat than is needed for protein. (Arguably, any amount of meat is more than needed for protein; legumes and tofu offer comparable protein per calorie.) Yet, meat contains saturated fats that increase risk for heart disease and stroke. The World Health Organization reports that processed meats like bacon and sausage certainly cause cancer and that red meat probably causes cancer, too. Eating more plant-based meals could mitigate this unnecessary risk for heart disease, stroke and cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, we want to discuss animal welfare without going into the graphic details that most readers probably already know. Instead, we’ll say this: To minimize costs and maximize profits, animals are treated like inanimate objects, not living creatures who can suffer. This industry affects the lives of nine billion animals – each the center of a distinct life – every year in the U.S. alone. Any reduction in this unnecessary suffering matters immensely to these animals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all, plant-based diets improve our health, our environment and the welfare of animals. While it is unrealistic to ask people to go veg overnight, a reasonable compromise exists, too: Students can try going meatless on Mondays. Doing so helps you build a repertoire of veg-options that you can rely on later if you do eventually decide to help the environment, the animals and your health by going veg all week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our university has a role to play here as well. In the course of our lives, college offers the best time to experiment with different lifestyles, belief systems and interests since habits – especially dietary habits – tend to become cemented during adulthood. As a result, the university has a unique opportunity and consequently a unique responsibility to assist students trying to reduce their meat consumption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen and Dining Services have already made commendable progress toward that end. The convenience stores, for example, introduced new vegan options this quarter, and Dining Services goes above and beyond in serving sustainable food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many plant-based Gauchos find that it is easier to eat at home than on campus. To make a plant-based diet easier, convenience stores on campus could carry more than a single vegan green salad; there are eight non-vegan ones. Dining commons could introduce vegan desserts, as UC Davis and UC Berkeley have done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larger projects are also worth considering. UCSB’s Climate Action Report could include food-related emissions under scope-three emissions so we can more effectively monitor our food’s environmental impact. As contracts for red and processed meat expire, Dining Services could commit to replacing at least portions of those ingredients with plant-based ingredients. Such moves, of course, require time and resources to implement; trade-offs always have to be made. For reasons outlined above, our view is that prioritizing plant-based diets is pivotal if our priorities include the environment, student nutrition and animal welfare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB, let’s go veg.</span></p>\n<p><em>This article was written by UCSB’s Health, Environment, and Animal Rights Club. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/letter-to-the-editor-ucsb-lets-go-veg/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/letter-to-the-editor-ucsb-lets-go-veg/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/letter-to-the-editor-ucsb-lets-go-veg/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/letter-to-the-editor-ucsb-lets-go-veg/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/letter-to-the-editor-ucsb-lets-go-veg/","id":6228,"author":{"id":645,"name":"UCSB Health, Environment, and Animal Rights"},"related":[6227,6226,6225],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Response to It’s Morning Again in America","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Calvin Chiu shares his perspective as a conservative with regards to last week's article It's Morning Again in America ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A piece published several days ago in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> talked of how Americans should not be surprised at the outcome of the presidential election, as Donald Trump’s “candidacy was much larger than Democrat and Republican” and that it was “a movement that brought together Americans of all backgrounds and races.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot help but wonder if the author followed the same election that I did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The election that many millions of Americans and I witnessed was one that exhibited the most hurtful, divisive and deceitful rhetoric in recent memory.

These are stubborn facts recorded in articles and video footage.

Or he could start by acknowledging the support that his candidate has received from groups like the Ku Klux Klan, who are so enthusiastic about his victory that David Duke, a former grand wizard of that organization </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/796249464826687488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boasted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps, Mr. Banuelos, you argue that grouping you together with the KKK is an inherently unfair characterization, and you would be right. After all, no group containing millions of Americans can be fairly painted with broad brushstrokes. Yet you seem so unhesitatingly willing to do the same for those who opposed Mr. Trump’s candidacy by labeling the large proportion of Americans who opposed Trump as merely “the left,” as if they were a monolithic political force devoid of the differing beliefs individuals can still have with their ideological peers. </span></p>\n<p>If we really are to unite together and put patriotism above partisanship, we ought to start by dispensing with the caricatures that have permeated our discourse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a conservative, the author’s embrace of Trump’s candidacy on the basis of conservatism puzzles me. I believe that America is safest when we embrace a policy of what Reagan called “peace through strength,” by establishing a strong and rigorous defense and standing resolutely with our allies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump believes that our partners in NATO are disposable, and that our support should be contingent upon how much they’ve paid us, as if we ought to play the role of the mafia demanding protection money. If Mr. Trump truly believed in “peace through strength,” he should know that NATO has helped </span><a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/nato/nato-can-remain-relevant/p28292\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preserve stability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Europe for over half a century, and that our alliances are instrumental to our security, especially in this increasingly interconnected world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conservatism stems from the belief that the free market is the greatest economic engine in history, and when reasonably regulated, can create a rising tide that lifts all boats. Free trade facilitated Europe’s miraculous economic recovery after World War II and America’s stratospheric rise to the status of a global superpower. It has enabled those with lower incomes to have higher spending power by giving them access to cheaper products, and capitalism continues to be the economic force that lifts millions out of poverty in Africa and Asia.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>This is not to say that freer trade has not come without its costs. Millions of American workers have lost manufacturing jobs because of foreign competition, and we should rightfully find ways to help them. But Donald Trump’s policies will not do that.

The office carries a great burden of responsibility, one that I do not believe Donald Trump is fit to carry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m ashamed of the decision our country has made on who should be president for the next four years.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing potential tuition hikes, the Office of the External Vice President writes this letter to the student body of UCSB. This is the first of many in a series of letters outlining our plan on how to combat future tuition hikes.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Organic Act of 1868 promised that “tuition shall be free to all residents of [California]” permitting that the university had enough income for free education for all students. While for many years this pledge held true, the Board of Regents started skirting around this responsibility in 1921 by charging various fees, like an incidental fee and a registration fee. The Board continued avoiding the t-word even when in 1970 they enacted a high “educational fee” for all undergraduate and graduate students — a tuition increase in all but the name. This marked the beginning of a long rise in incremental charges to California residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From then on, things started taking a turn for the worse. Between 1975 and 1985, the annual cost of tuition and fees went from $630 to $1,296 for resident undergraduates, a 105 percent increase. In 1995, resident undergrads had to pay $4,354 annually, a number that climbed to $7,434 in 2005. This reached a flashpoint in 2009 when students occupied UC buildings in protest of a massive proposed 32 percent increase in tuition. The UC system began facing budget cuts, and in 2011 students paid more into the system in tuition than the state did in funding it. Today, resident undergraduates pay $12,294 annually in tuition and fees. Thanks to a strong mobilization effort from the student bodies across the UCs and the passing of Proposition 30, a tax on high earners to fund higher education, a two-year tuition freeze was agreed to in 2015. This tuition freeze expires at the end of this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I must preface this by saying that cutting funding for education is not done out of necessity, but out of political choice. Despite the renewal of Proposition 30 (Proposition 55 on the ballot), we might still be facing a tuition increase. If one is on the table, the hike would be slated for January. This means we must organize immediately to prevent another tuition hike from going through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doctrine of “high fee high aid” (HFHA) has dominated the Board of Regents’ approach to tuition for the past decade. In a nutshell, HFHA means exactly what its name implies: charge high fees to students and offer high financial aid. Not only is HFHA dangerous, but it is also unsustainable. High tuition has real ramifications on how students decide where to go to college and what they choose to study. A UK study conducted by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON) found that students from low-income backgrounds are 20 percent more likely to attend a university near home and live at home while studying than their peers. Additionally, if fees were reduced, the participants said they were 45 percent more likely to choose a different major and 60 percent would work less during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary reasons why the UC system has had to increase tuition are difficult to pin down. While they can be attributed to decreased state funding and higher enrollment rates, the root of problem is much deeper than that. The General Fund has faced increasing demands in recent years and other necessary expenditures, like K-12 education and prisons, which have eaten a large portion of the budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these difficulties, the Office of the External Vice President remains committed to implementing new and innovative ways to prevent future tuition hikes. There are many solutions available, but one thing remains clear: We need wide sweeping changes to the way the University of California and California approach funding higher education.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74246\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74246\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/understanding-tuition-hikes-a-letter-from-the-office-of-the-external-vice-president/","id":5734,"author":{"id":390,"name":"Maya Halthore"},"related":[5733,5732,5731],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Special District Deception","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Dean Stewart shares why he believes Isla Vistans should vote against the Community Service District.

From former students and retired professors, the UCSB Foundation and Trustees, the idea came from everywhere and anywhere, every story sliced very finely, scrubbed clean and intended to prove the impartiality of university administration. The idea was forced upon them; they had to be compelled to become the major organizing factor behind the special district and commit over a million dollars to its solvency. </p>\n<p>\tAn obvious fact about the drive for the Community Service District is that it is not a student movement. I remember the Isla Vista of the early 1970s when the original drive for Isla Vista cityhood took place. There was a highly politicized student population; scores of young people took part in canvassing and circulating petitions. Students crowded and overflowed the Board of Supervisors meeting room on many occasions. The project, however, ran into the same stone wall more than once: the denial of financial viability for the Local Agency Formation Commission.</p>\n<p>\tIf the original idea for Isla Vista self-governance came from the student politics of the 1960s, it would be a mistake to assume it was a cause embraced by all progressives. The simplest and most lasting criticism of Isla Vista semi-independence is that it will not work for the students. The situation favors the stable, lasting forces. The students pass through, while UCSB administration is always there. The students will always be playing catch-up, always at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>\tUCSB administration would not advocate and support the creation of the Community Service District if they did not think they could control it. What they once opposed as a student movement, they now advocate. They recruited assemblymember Das Williams to write legislation to push aside the Local Agency Formation Commission. The political machinery put to work with Williams’s help is the most remarkable I have seen in over 40 years of Santa Barbara politics. It is a steam roller of paid staff and political hierarchy that all comes from outside Isla Vista. It is fraud calling for democracy. It is a powerful institution with a politician in its pocket.</p>\n<p>\tParking restrictions are the most often-stated goal of the special district. The whole intention is to constrain, confine and sequester Isla Vista to prohibit its free and easy access. A cumbersome, expensive system of stickers and tickets and 24 hour supervision would be created. Students who expect their friends to be able to visit would be faced with numerous obstacles.</p>\n<p>\tWhen students go to vote on Nov. 8, they will find a convenient slate of candidates, all approved by the UCSB-Das Williams machine. At this point, if anyone in Isla Vista feels like they are getting something shoved down their throat, they are. The cynicism of dominance pretending to be democracy is grotesque. This is not I.V. liberation. It is I.V. lockdown. </p>\n<p><em>Dean Stewart is a local writer and historian. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-special-district-deception/","id":5733,"author":{"id":388,"name":"Dean Stewart"},"related":[5732,5731,5730],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Why a Vote for Bruce Porter is a Vote for Big Oil","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Casey Mix and Grady Zant warn against Bruce Porter's ties to big oil.

The billions of dollars and corporate interests saturating campaigns every election cycle are overwhelming, leaving many American voters across the political spectrum feeling discouraged and powerless. One important way we as students can prevent the overwhelming influence of moneyed interests and so-called super PACs on election outcomes is by shifting our attention to local elections and propositions further down the ballot.</p>\n<p>Take the race for 3rd Third District Supervisor between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann in Santa Barbara County, for example. Porter’s campaign has been supported by over $60,000 from the oil and gas industries. These large donations from fossil fuel corporations in a relatively smaller local election should raise a red flag, especially given the county’s history with environmentally devastating oil spills. With four different energy companies looking to activate over a 1,000 new wells, currently awaiting approval in Santa Barbara County, a vote for Bruce Porter would almost certainly mean a vote for more oil drilling and fracking, environmental and social injustice, as well as supporting yet another politician who is for sale to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, candidate Joan Hartmann has a long history of fighting the oil and gas industries. Hartmann’s biggest environmental victory was “helping found the Southern California Wetlands Recovery Project, a novel public-private partnership among government agencies, business and environmental interests that has secured over $628 million to restore rivers and wetlands from Gaviota to San Diego. These efforts increase water supplies, restore habitats, and create jobs,”<br>\n(joanhartmannforsupervisor.com).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This type of leadership, innovation and initiative in which protecting our environment can go hand-in-hand with protecting people and their jobs, is exactly what our community deserves from those who represent us. Moreover, this is the kind of leadership that, with public pressure, can protect our elections from the influence of big money and the fossil fuel industry. With an incredible array of endorsements from firefighters and nurses to the Sierra Club, it’s obvious which candidate will fight to protect our coasts, climate and futures (hint: it’s not Bruce).</p>\n<p>Because of its dense population, Isla Vista represents roughly one-third of the total votes for the Third District Supervisor election. This figure confirms how much of an impact young people potentially possess. It’s essential for students residing in Isla Vista to get to the polls on Nov. 8 to have their voices heard. Though one may feel discouraged regarding today’s political atmosphere, it’s imperative to understand that change starts at the bottom. Educating one’s self on down-ballot candidates is vital to real progress. Leaving local elections to a game of eeny-meeny-miny-mo is not only unacceptable, but leaves the door wide open to people who will corrupt our democracy and pollute our communities.</p>\n<p><em>Written by Casey Mix and Grady Zant </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/letter-to-the-editor-why-a-vote-for-bruce-porter-is-a-vote-for-big-oil/","id":5732,"author":{"id":389,"name":"Grady Zant"},"related":[5731,5730,5729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Yes on Proposition 54 for Transparency","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lettertotheditor.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"A letter to the editor from UCSB board of CALPIRG students secretary Cole Hyatt in favor of Proposition 54. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For years, Santa Barbara students have been fighting for greater representation and say in Santa Barbara County. According to the most recent secretary of state report, Santa Barbara County has the second highest 18-25 age voting demographic in the State at 17.41 percent. Yet, continually, Isla Vista is largely left out of the process by the political establishment. </p>\n<p>As the secretary of the UCSB board of CALPIRG students, I have spent my time fighting on behalf of those who feel voiceless and powerless in our current system. Millions of Californians feel the same way UCSB students feel — that entrenched establishment voices matter more than theirs. Luckily, Californians will have the opportunity this November to change the system.</p>\n<p>Proposition 54 — the California Legislature Transparency Act — will put our voices first by requiring all bills being considered in the state legislature be posted online and be in print for 72 hours prior to a final vote in both houses. It will also require all committee hearings open to the public to be recorded and posted online within 24 hours and will allow attendees of public hearings to record and post their videos of the hearings. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Millions of Californians share our problem; there is no easy way to Sacramento without a significant investment of time and money. The current system ensures only those with money or close proximity can attend committee hearings and have their voices heard. The result is legislation that benefits a small few at the expense of the majority. </p>\n<p>Proposition 54 will bring democracy and transparency to all Californians with access to the internet. Committees will no longer be held in obscure Capitol rooms that escape media attention and public scrutiny, but instead in homes and dorm rooms across California. This new access to the legislative process will level the playing field between Californians and special interests, since lobbyists will no longer have an unchecked power to a legislator’s ear. </p>\n<p>With legislation posted online for 72 hours, Californians will have time to review legislation that matters to them.  After reading the legislation, Californians will be able to have educated conversations with their elected representatives and express their concerns or support. Legislators will benefit because they will hear directly from their constituents on how legislation affects their district and thus can vote accordingly. </p>\n<p>With the outdated rule banning video recordings of legislative sessions overturned, Californians will finally be able to follow the legislative process from start to finish. Californians will be able to see more than just a roll call of votes, but gain full access to a bill’s deliberations prior to a vote. Hundreds of cities and counties already allow it, so should our state Legislature</p>\n<p>Proposition 54 will deliver meaningful reform by making our legislative process more transparent while including millions of Californians from the legislative sidelines. If you feel our democracy should be more inclusive and that our government should be more transparent with its workings, then I encourage each of my fellow Gauchos to join me in voting “Yes” on Proposition 54 on Nov. 8. It’s time to end business as usual.</p>\n<p><em>Cole Hyatt is the current secretary of the UCSB board of CALPIRG students.
