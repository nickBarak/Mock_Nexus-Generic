According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guardian’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interactive database of people killed by U.S. police, over 1,367 low-income individuals, predominantly people of color, were killed in 2015 alone. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, African Americans are incarcerated at 10 times the rate of white Americans. This, and other evidence­supported claims by the Black Lives Matter network(s) and associated movements, reveal a continuing, significant, disproportionately high level of violence against people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally disturbing is the rise of so-called “white student unions” that allege discrimination toward “people of European descent” and are, by definition, white supremacist hate groups. Allegations of “reverse discrimination” by white supremacists seek to shut down serious debate about the growing problem of institutional racism in our schools, courts, housing and local governments. In this manner, white supremacist organizations are attempting to hijack national debate on the murder of people of color through aggressive policing by instead alleging racial discrimination toward white people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at UCSB, the controversy concerning the establishment of an online white supremacist hate group has centered around whether or not it is a hoax and on whether or not any response to it constitutes an attack on free speech. Through alleging that any response constitutes an infringement of free speech, white supremacists are seeking to shut down criticisms of their racist organizations through automatic allegations of censorship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several local incidents of violence near our campus are additionally disturbing. In April 2015, Meagan Hockaday, an African-American woman and mother of three, was shot and killed by police officers in nearby Oxnard, CA. In September 2015, Black Lives Matter signs posted at St. Michaels University Church in I.V. were stolen, and the church’s plate glass door was shot out. In October 2015, the death of a Latino student in I.V. drew accusations of official misconduct by students who claimed authorities were too slow to respond to his life-threatening injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These and other incidents continue to create a tense environment in our community. This tension is compounded by white supremacists’ calls for a white student walkout and rally at the UCSB Multicultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, the UCSB GSA announces its formal opposition to this “white student union” and any other hate groups that predicate their cultural identity on violence and the denial of the multi­culturalism at the heart of our University.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We stand for and value compassion, empathy, diversity and the critique of privilege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We urge students to join us in solidarity against racism in all its manifestations on campus and in our communities, both locally and across the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We demand that university administration formally investigate this online white supremacist hate group in order to ascertain whether the motives for its inception violate the principles of community at UCSB, as well as our student and faculty codes of conduct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We additionally demand that university administration remain vigilant with regards to any such organizations appropriating our community and values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We finally demand that university administration actively protects students from harassment, stalking, cyber­stalking or any form of hate crimes and hate speech.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/ucsb-gsa-formal-statement-of-solidarity-for-racial-equity/","id":5775,"author":{"id":633,"name":"Graduate Students Association"},"related":[5774,5773,5772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Living Wages Left Out of Library Renovations","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/libraryopening-art.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/libraryopening-art.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the day of the grand opening of UCSB's new library, library employee Laurence Young asks us to look past the new building at the people working inside. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the recent completion of the Library Addition and Renovation project, it seems like a good moment to reflect on those areas still in need of attention. While the $76 million project has addressed some major needs of the campus and the library itself, there are still critical problems facing the staff who work in the building every day.</p>\n<p>A recent study by the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute found that 98.6 percent of UCSB clerical support staff do not make enough to support themselves and a child on their salary in the Santa Barbara area. The situation in the library is even worse. The library assistants who directly serve the campus community are hurt twice—first, by being forced to stay in an outdated job classification that does not reflect the high level of their professional library work, and then again as UCSB salaries are among the lowest of all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>In 2014 the library employed 82 library assistants who made, on average, $34,596.63. To put that in perspective, the median family income for Santa Barbara is $75,400. The EPI study calculated that you need $59,268 to meet your basic needs, and none of the library assistants received that kind of salary. Worse yet, 61 of these staff members meet the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s definition of low income.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite the fact that I have earned two master’s degrees from UCSB and that I am expected to resolve complex, research-related queries, during the first three years I worked in the library I was forced to rely on my retired mother for help each month with groceries. As I near 40 years old, it is deeply humiliating to be unable to support myself on the wages I earn.<br>\nI am humiliated to be in such a penurious state, but I am grateful that I have the family support structure to help me stay afloat. The stories I hear from my fellow co-workers who are in situations much worse than mine are humbling. One woman has her ex-husband and her grown children helping her meet her rent each month. Another colleague is in a situation like mine, receiving help from her retired parents, but had the added horror of needing to go on disability due to surgery. And of course there is the army of UCSB employees who live nowhere near Santa Barbara and commute more than an hour each way in order to make ends meet on their salary.</p>\n<p>These stories are legion amongst the library staff at UCSB, but they don’t describe what we do every day in service to the campus community. We are the public face of the library, helping you, our patrons, with everything from checking out materials and managing course reserves to opening the library every day and assuring that the information resources that our campus needs are accessible. We process new materials as they arrive and have the critical job of making sure that you can find them in the library catalog and on the shelves. We provide research and reference help throughout the various collections and we facilitate the complicated transfer of research materials from our off-campus annexes and other libraries around the world. We are the vital link between the collection, the librarians and you.

Long-presumed nominee for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, gets most of the media attention. But one of the other candidates vying for the Democratic Party nomination is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His campaign has been a spirited fight against corporate influence and corruption in politics. He speaks for the 99 percent and its struggle against the 1 percent. Sanders first entered politics in 1981 when he was elected the mayor of Burlington, VT. After serving for four terms as mayor, he ran for the at-large Congressional seat in Vermont in 1990 and won, serving eight terms. When a Senate seat opened up in 2006, Bernie ran and won, then was re-elected in 2012 by an astounding 71 percent of the vote. He is a champion of progressive causes, warns against a ruling oligarchy and has built his entire political career on fighting for social and economic justice.</p>\n<p>Since launching his campaign on May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Bernie Sanders has distinguished himself by not accepting Super Pac monies. He only accepts small, individual contributions, typically about $35 each. His efforts have raised enough money to remain viable in a campaign in which the Koch brothers will be throwing in over $900 million. Against this backdrop, we see that Sanders now draws thousands and thousands of people to his events and many of those people are not the old guard liberals, but young people — millennials, in college or out of college and coming to grips with a world that seems to be getting harder and colder. Many of them are burdened by student debt, that awful unshakeable millstone that threatens their future. Sanders offers a lot to these young people. His College for All Act calls for public college and university tuition to be free, paid for by a transaction tax on Wall Street (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock and a 0.1 percent fee on bonds). He wants work-study programs to be expanded and the student financial aid application process to be simplified. He has repeatedly called for a restructuring of student debt to lower interest rates and has even brought up the idea of eliminating student loan debt. Sanders’ philosophy of education is that it is a public good, not a private commodity, and as such should be available to all qualified applicants: Sanders states, “We live in a highly competitive global economy, and if our economy is to be strong, we need the best-educated workforce in the world.” These are just some of the reasons young people support a 74-year-old Democratic Socialist.</p>\n<p>Because today’s young people are not dumb, they can see that they’ve been screwed. They’ve seen their parents lose their houses. They know that good jobs and viable careers are scarce and getting scarcer. They can see the rapid centralization of wealth and power. They know that their future seems meaningless to the powerful — to the corporations and ultra-wealthy, corrupt politicians. And they know that the future of the world itself is being recklessly endangered by “conservatives” who deny science and global warming. Sanders is succeeding with young people because he’s speaking their language, honestly and from the heart. No focus groups or poll-tested responses needed. Again, these are not dim, unaware people absorbed by their cell phones. They have street smarts — they know when they’re being conned, and they know they’re not being conned by Bernie. Bernie represents the possibility of hope — this, the rarest of commodities these days.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There is an honesty and integrity to the man that is all but completely absent from the current political landscape. Everything has become a game; it has to be sold to the crowd the way refrigerators are sold to the customer. Sanders rejects this notion. Matt Taibbi, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine who has followed Sanders for years in his long career in Congress, says “… He’s not looking for a book deal or a membership in a Martha’s Vineyard golf club … This election isn’t a game to him … he genuinely believes the system is not beyond repair” (“The Case for Bernie Sanders” Rolling Stone, 11/03/15).</p>\n<p>Will young people become more involved — will they step up and turn the tide? It’s impossible to know, but there is a huge potential here for Sanders and for democracy. As he reminds us often, “No president, no leader, can do it without the people standing together.” Bernie Sanders has railed against the rising tyranny of the oligarchy which threatens this democracy. We think the new generation, particularly those in college, understand this. They are like a huge bonfire, laid and ready for a match — will it catch fire? We sure hope so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

People interested in ecosocialism, a movement dedicated to achieving a just society and a sustainable planet through democratic participation, came from across the state and Vancouver to share our organizing experiences, local struggles and discuss ways to build an ecosocialist movement.</p>\n<p>For a glimpse of the spirit of this gathering, see the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/142316748\">video</a>, or read the Nexus article, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/\">“UCSB Hosts Ecosocialism Conference in Girvetz”</a> by Christopher Chen, who attended the events and interviewed some of the organizers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In another Nexus article titled “The Ecosocialism Parasite,” author Jason Garshfield, who was not present, not only makes many baseless remarks, but also conflates communism with socialism and ecosocialism. Ecosocialism is not an attempt to piggyback and steal the momentum of the global movement aimed at mitigating climate change in order to push a “red” agenda. Rather, ecosocialism aims for an economic system based on human need and the reduction of the gross inequalities that exist everywhere today — the socialism part — and emphasizes the ecological through respect and stewardship of our natural environment and lessening the devastating impact of our economic activity on the very basis of life. Ecosocialism is a rebalancing of the world — transforming society to a more ecocentric worldview. With a systemic analysis, we understand the crises of social inequalities and environmental catastrophe as inextricably linked. In the current political economic system of capitalism, where profit is the highest goal attained by growth at all costs, we see mass social inequalities and a devastated climate as symptoms of a systemic malady.</p>\n<p>As ecosocialists, we do advocate public ownership of utilities. We believe communities should be able to control their common resources. We can look at water as an example. Access to water is a right and not a commodity. When resources are privatized, they are often mismanaged by corporations who also create monopolies and raise rates. This is a common story told across the globe, from the Cochabamba Water War against Bechtel in Bolivia to Detroit’s water crisis, where rates had risen 119% over the last decade. We need to be able to make the decisions that affect our lives, and we do this through democratizing the decision making processes so that we can create a world built upon fulfilling our needs.</p>\n<p>Of the many troubling claims made by Mr. Garshfield, the most worrying to our member, fourth-year CCS biology major Henry Morse, was the claim that “scientists should not be making economic prognoses at all.” To argue that scientists should remain in their labs and out of public discourse has long been a technique used to keep the reality of our society’s ills hidden away from the public. Can we imagine what our country would be like if scientists like Rachel Carson (,who illuminated the dangers of the pesticide DDT,) hadn’t left their labs to speak out about the societal consequences of their work? Monsanto, the largest agri-business operation in the world, is poisoning the planet just by following its business model of maximizing growth and profit at the expense of our health, the livelihoods of farmers the world over and the possibility of our children inhabiting a livable environment. Just ask Neil Young, who tells this story on his most recent album the Monsanto Years.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor John Foran, one of the gathering’s organizers and a member of the national System Change Not Climate Change ecosocialist network (and an ardent fan of Neil Young’s music and activism) is singled out as possessing “no background in economics. Why does Professor Foran feel qualified to advocate a radical systemic overhaul in a field he does not even study?” This is a fair question, on the surface. Foran’s response,: “Jason seems to believe that one needs a doctorate in economics to be a critic of capitalism, while at the same time noting, ‘To economists, the success of capitalism is at least as much of a consensus as the existence of global warming is among climate scientists. They might debate the minutiae, but the major points are not in doubt.’ The point today is that the climate crisis has been caused by the normal operation of capitalism. Why then should we look to pro-capitalist economists to fix it? It was the great radical economist Kenneth Boulding who famously wrote that ‘Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.’ Boulding was president of the American Economic Association and made contributions to sociology, political science, social psychology and philosophy as a contributor to the approach known as General Systems Theory.”</p>\n<p>Jason misunderstands the “tragedy of the commons” as a critique of collective ownership of a common good, when public control over common goods like fresh water, clean air and the land that sustains our food production is in fact the solution to this problem. The tragedy of the commons is a problem generated by each individual maximizing his or her private good, a central tenet of free-market capitalism. The socialist Albert Einstein himself said that maybe we shouldn’t fix a problem with the system that created it.</p>\n<p>Jason also asserts that “when a good is private, people will be careful not to deplete the resource on their own property, because costs will be incurred by the individual actor.” Yet the reason that we have an unprecedented environmental crisis on our hands is that corporations do not have to pay the full costs of their operation in terms of either resources depleted or toxic waste and greenhouse gases produced, costs which economists tellingly refer to as “externalities.” Ecosocialists, whether trained economists or not, see this devastation of the natural world as “the second contradiction of capitalism” (the first being the cruel incentive of employers to drive down wages as much as possible).</p>\n<p>Growth at all costs, regardless of its effects on our earth and collective health, is a cornerstone of global capitalism today. Just this past month, Volkswagen, the world’s largest automobile manufacturer, admitted to rigging emissions tests in over 11 million cars. Cars were installed with devices that would direct a car’s engine to emit less pollutants, 98 percent less, during a test. What does it mean if VW, ranked most sustainable car maker in the world, is rigging its vehicles to pass emissions tests they would otherwise fail? The bottom line is green consumerism will not save us when profit is the driving force.</p>\n<p>We can argue that this is a case of a few greedy executives, some “bad apples,” but the case of green-washing (creating a false environmentally-conscious image by appropriating environmental concern to expand markets) can be seen across industries, including, most absurdly, the fossil fuel corporations that are the largest and richest the world has ever seen. And recently, ExxonMobil has been found to have <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/10/16/solo-arrest-bill-mckibben-spotlights-exxons-unparalleled-evil\">lied to the public</a> for years when its own scientists told its executives of the dangers of climate change.</p>\n<p>How do we start the desperately needed transition into a more just and sustainable system that rejects all socially and ecologically destructive systems, like patriarchy, racism, homophobia, transphobia and capitalism? What are the local measures we can take? How do we build people power and reclaim the right to make the decisions that affect our communities? These questions and others will be discussed at meetings of the UCSB System Change Not Climate Change group.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in these questions send an email to scnccsb@gmail.com for info on our next meeting. We invite Jason to attend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/system-change-not-climate-change-a-response-to-the-ecosocialism-parasite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/system-change-not-climate-change-a-response-to-the-ecosocialism-parasite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/system-change-not-climate-change-a-response-to-the-ecosocialism-parasite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/system-change-not-climate-change-a-response-to-the-ecosocialism-parasite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/system-change-not-climate-change-a-response-to-the-ecosocialism-parasite/","id":6140,"author":{"id":630,"name":"System Change Not Climate Change SB"},"related":[6139,6138,6137],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What the Abortion Debate is Really About","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Carlos Flores explains his support for the sanctity of life in the abortion debate.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1691675998\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58934\"><img data-attachment-id=\"58445\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-19/weekend-wrap-up-30/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n1.jpg?fit=253%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"253,339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n1.jpg?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n1.jpg?fit=253%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n1-186x250.jpg?resize=186%2C250\" alt=\"1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n\" width=\"186\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-58445\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>A certain news editorial was recently published in the Daily Nexus regarding a civil lawsuit that Life Legal Defense, a pro-life group, is advancing against Dr. Miller-Young, the professor involved in the unfortunate altercation with pro-life demonstrators earlier this year. While reporting on this is certainly newsworthy, it is important to take a step back to intellectually scrutinize the issue of abortion that spurred this unfortunate incidental encounter. Whether one is opposed to or in favor of the continued legality of abortion, it is generally agreed by both sides that the question is one of weighty concern. If Pro-Choicers are correct, then opposing the continued legality of abortion amounts to unjustly restricting the liberties and bodily sovereignty of women. If, on the other hand, Pro-Lifers are correct, support for abortion amounts to an outright denial of those same liberties and rights to the unborn of either gender vis-a-vis the gross killing of human beings on a scale never before imagined.</p>\n<p>So who is right? We ought to begin, as many philosophers who have engaged this issue have, by asking a fundamental question upon which the entire disagreement rests: What is the unborn? We cannot begin to ponder whether it is morally permissible to kill something unless we first know what it is. Suppose, for example, that you are playing with your 6-year-old nephew. Suppose he goes around a corner out of your sight and shouts out to you: “Hey, can I kill this thing?” Your answer, one would hope, would be: “Wait — kill what?” As you go around the corner to see what he is referring to, you might suppose that he is pointing to a nasty-looking spider. In that case, you might say in response: “Wow, that’s a nasty-looking spider. Go ahead and smash it.” For most of us, there is no ethical problem here. But now suppose that, as you are walking around the corner, you see that your nephew is pointing to your neighbor’s dog, Buddy. In this case, you might say: “What? Of course you can’t kill Buddy! His owner will be very upset!” To go one step further, suppose that as you walk around the corner your nephew is pointing to his younger brother, Thomas. In this case, you might say: “What’s gotten into you? Of course you can’t kill your brother Thomas!” If you fancied yourself a philosopher, you might add something like: “All things being equal, human beings are the sorts of things that we have an exigent moral obligation to refrain from killing and, because Thomas is a human being, it would thus be a grave moral transgression for you to kill him.”</p>\n<p>The question, then, is this: Is the unborn a human being? If so, then aborting an unborn child would be grave moral transgression akin to your nephew’s killing his brother Thomas. If not, then an abortion would instead be comparable to the removing of a wart or a hair follicle, and so no ethical problem would present itself. But it’s easier to settle this question than you may think. Indeed, when one begins to seriously consider this question, it becomes difficult to imagine the unborn as anything but human. After all, the unborn is alive, it is growing internally and it has human parents. So what else could it be? It is not bovine or feline or reptilian, for example. It is, in fortunate circumstances, also not dead. It is also not merely a part of the mother’s body, lest we be led to the rather absurd conclusion that pregnant women have four arms, four legs, two hearts and, in many cases, both male and female reproductive organs. An embryo also has its own unique DNA upon the moment of conception. Regardless of their religious, metaphysical or ethical commitments, embryologists agree on this much: “A zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo).” “Although life is a continuous process, fertilization (which, incidentally, is not a ‘moment’) is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new genetically distinct human organism is formed when the chromosomes of the male and female pronuclei blend in the oocyte.” Even Alan Guttmacher, a former president of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, recognized this, commenting: “This all seems so simple and evident that it is difficult to picture a time when it wasn’t part of the common knowledge.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Many Pro-Choicers have presented objections to the above like the following: “If it is immoral to kill human beings, then, by your reasoning, isn’t it a moral tragedy when ‘human’ skin cells or sperm cells are killed or when they are allowed to die? If we give fetuses a right to life, then doesn’t this imply that we also have to extend skin cells and sperm cells this same right? So, unless you mourn for dandruff, you’re not being consistent.” But this objection makes the mistake of confusing parts with wholes. Upon fertilization, an embryo is a complete organism that directs its development from within in a way that skin and sperm cells do not. All by itself, neither a skin cell nor a sperm cell will develop into an adult human being. But an embryo will. More precisely we can say this about parts and wholes: Parts are metaphysically posterior to the whole insofar as parts are ordered, in coordination with one another, towards the good of the whole. That is, parts are distinct from the whole insofar as parts strive in unity with other parts towards a common unified goal, namely, the life of the whole organism of which they are a part. It is easy to see this in humans. Hearts, for example, work in conjunction and coordination with other parts (namely livers, lungs, brains, etc.) towards a single end or goal: the biological life of the whole. In light of this, then, this objection doesn’t prove to be very convincing.</p>\n<p>Having hopefully allayed some possible objections, we can, then, reason as follows:</p>\n<p>It is prima facie immoral to kill human beings.<br>\nAbortion kills human beings.<br>\nTherefore, abortion is prima facie immoral.<br>\nThe unjustified killing of human beings ought to be illegal.<br>\nTherefore, abortion ought to be illegal.</p>\n<p>By prima facie, I mean to say that, at first glance or “on the face of it,” it is morally impermissible to kill human beings. This is an extremely plausible premise that most — if not all — rational human beings immediately recognize to be true. Note also how this premise allows for the argument to avoid begging any questions by allowing for circumstances in which it might be morally permissible to kill a human being, for instance, killing in self-defense, as capital punishment for a crime or killing by the waging of a just war, if there is such a thing, etc. And thus, it seems, we have a plausible argument against abortion.</p>\n<p><em>Carlos Flores finds that his logic inevitably leads him to support the life of the fetus.</em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This declaration is inspired by the events related to the 43 missing students from the Escuela Normal “Raúl Isidro Burgos” in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero.</p>\n<p>Through this public statement, we highlight the need for the Mexican government to act with urgency, efficiency and in the immediate interests of the oppressed. We also declare our solidarity with the families of the missing students, and with millions of Mexicans who have been subjected to State violence and daily acts of hostility in an ever-expanding militarized police state. We declare that Mexico has been and continues to be subjected to State-sponsored terrorism, where police brutality reflects the will of the ruling elites.</p>\n<p>The events in Ayotzinapa are not isolated incidents, nor are they void of a historical context; Mexico continues to remember the numerous and consistent incidents of violence and repression it has endured. These instances range from the individualized murders of people who dare call out a government that is responsible for the levels of poverty and violence the country endures, the countless missing that have attempted to cross multiple borders, to the massacres of entire groups of students, activists, Indigenous people, women and more. We witnessed these events throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and as we witness the events in Ayotzinapa, we remember the events of Tlatelolco, Atenco and Piedras Blancas, amongst others.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On Nov. 7, government officials announced the discovery of human remains that arguably belong to the missing students. The circumstances under which the students disappeared are an outrage, to say the least, and the indifference and lack of transparency shown by government officials become apparent in their lack of efficient communication, and most recently, in Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s willingness to travel to China during this time of crisis. Enrique Peña Nieto’s silence speaks volumes of the state’s complicity in the actions that led to the disappearance of 43 missing students in Ayotzinapa.</p>\n<p>The events taking place in Ayotzinapa are simply one example of the impunity under which the Mexican State deploys maximum force to silence any individuals or groups it labels as dissidents. With this in mind, we join millions of people worldwide as we too demand justice for Ayotzinapa.</p>\n<p>What we are witnessing in Ayotzinapa is a form of State repression that parallels the repression witnessed in Ferguson, Missouri, and in Palestine; as we make connections between these communities, we feel inspired by the critical acts of solidarity demonstrated by those people who are most directly hurt by this repressive system, we see these solidarity efforts largely through social media. It is in this spirit of resistance and solidarity that we hope to bring light to some of the issues we endure locally in the communities located near UCSB.</p>\n<p>On May 23, the Isla Vista community witnessed a terrible tragedy; many of us are still working on healing from the trauma of the incident. As a result of this tragedy, there have been proposals to increase police presence in this community. This is alarming, given that many of us are members of historically marginalized communities in the U.S., and we are aware that being perceived as dissidents, our communities are constantly vulnerable to hostile treatment at the hands of the local authorities. For every DUI checkpoint, for every increase in the UCSB and Santa Barbara police budget and for every added police officer in the area is a risk to the black and brown lives of the surrounding community.</p>\n<p>This is why we call the Santa Barbara community, and the UCSB community in particular, to manifest our discontent and indignation at the Ayotzinapa events. The problems of state-produced violence, of militarized policing and of repression are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a global problem. We join millions of people worldwide as we urge the Mexican government to provide an efficient and speedy resolution to the families of the 43 missing students.</p>\n<p>Today we remember the 43 students. Today we demand that they be found. Today we stand with our brothers in Ayotzinapa, with their relatives and with millions of Mexicans who loudly demand that peace be restored in the country.

Esto lo venimos presenciando desde los 1960s y 1970s, y al ver lo que sucede en Ayotzinapa, recordamos los hechos ocurridos en Tlatelolco, en Atenco, y en Piedras Blancas, entre otros.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">El 7 de Noviembre, representantes del gobierno anunciaron el descubrimiento de los presuntos restos de algunos de los estudiantes desaparecidos. Las circunstancias que rodean la desaparición de los jóvenes normalistas son indignantes, ya que la indiferencia y la falta de claridad en los comunicados de los representantes del gobierno se manifiestan a través de la falta de comunicación, y más reciente, a la pronta disposición del presidente mexicano Enrique Peña Nieto de viajar a China durante este tiempo de crisis. El silencio de Enrique Peña Nieto refleja a gritos la complicidad del Estado en las acciones que llevaron a la desaparición de los 43 estudiantes de Ayotzinapa.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">Los eventos que hemos presenciado en Ayotzinapa son un ejemplo más de la impunidad con la que el estado mexicano hace el uso máximo de la fuerza para silenciar a cualquier individuo o grupo que considere disidente. Es con esto en mente que nos unimos a las voces y al sentir de millones de personas en el mundo que exigen justicia por Ayotzinapa.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">En Ayotzinapa vemos la represión a manos del Estado de maneras similares a la represión vista en Ferguson, Missouri, y en Palestina; a la vez que hacemos conecciones entre estas localidades, nos sentimos inspiradxs al presenciar los actos cruciales de solidaridad demostrados por las personas mayormente afectadas por este sistema represivo, particularmente a través de las redes sociales. Es mediante este espíritu de lucha y de solidaridad que tratamos también algunos de los problemas que se manifiestan en la comunidad aledaña a el campus de UCSB.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">El pasado 23 de Mayo, la comunidad aledaña de Isla Vista presenció una terrible tragedia; muchxs de nosotrxs aún estamos trabajando para recuperarnos del trauma de ese incidente. A consecuencia de esta tragedia, se han propuesto iniciativas para incrementar la presencia de oficiales policiacos en esta comunidad. Esto es preocupante, ya que muchxs de nosotrxs pertenecemos a comunidades históricamente marginalizadas en los Estados Unidos, y sabemos que al ser percibidas como disidentes, nuestras comunidades están constantemente vulnerables al trato hostil de las autoridades. Con cada retén DUI (donde las autoridades revisan tus niveles de alcohol) que se implementa, y con cada oficial de policía que se añade al area, incrementan el número de riesgos con los que tienen que lidiar miembros de las comunidades Mexican@s/ Chican@s/ Latin@s y Afroamericanas.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">Es por esto que hacemos una convocatoria a la comunidad de Santa Barbara, y en particular a la comunidad académica de UCSB, para manifestar nuestro descontento e indignación con los eventos de Ayotzinapa. Los problemas de la violencia producida por el estado, de las inspecciones militarizadas, y de la represión no son incidentes aislados, son parte de un problema mundial. Nos unimos a los millones de personas globalmente al urgir al gobierno mexicano a que dé una resolución de manera eficaz y pronta a las familias de los cuarenta y tres estudiantes desaparecidos. </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"\">Hoy recordamos a los cuarenta y tres estudiantes.

If you were diagnosed with this deadly disease that has only a 50 percent survival rate, where would you turn to? Who wouldn’t turn you away? Doctors would not dare touch you unless completely masked behind personal protective equipment. Your family would want to be there for you, but they couldn’t without putting themselves at risk for contracting the virus. You’d be trapped in isolation. You’d live or die with as much certainty as a coin flip. Thousands of people face this exact situation, trying to maintain hope while knowing there is no cure.</p>\n<p>Interning at Direct Relief has opened my eyes to the virus’ destruction. With the organization sending medical equipment to disaster ridden areas, it I was in the forefront of the Ebola efforts since the beginning. It puzzles me, however, that only now have our phones been buzzing. Corporations are frantically contacting us for advice on preventative measures. People call worried that the virus will reach the United States. News centers, eager to collaborate with us, email us hoping to get a statement. Not to say that all the awareness is a bad thing, but did it take the spread of the Ebola outside of West Africa to spark this amount of attention for a disease that has killed about 5,000 people according to the CDC? Furthermore, people in the U.S. — who are at very low risk of contracting the virus — seem more concerned for their safety than that of people in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Being a global studies major at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I am lectured every day by my professors on inequality in the world. I was shocked to experience this at Direct Relief when a gigantic surge of awareness coincided with cases of Ebola emerging outside of the West African region. It seems that only now has the global community reacted to the epidemic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Interning at Direct Relief, I learned that this virus has been around for 40 years. For 40 years, people in African countries watched their loved ones die of this disease, paranoid that they would suffer the same fate. The U.S. is now experiencing this same paranoia. We’re realizing that the difference between ‘us’ and ‘them’ is actually a difference between ‘here’ and ‘there.’ The difference is that Ebola-hit countries in West Africa lack the same levels of economic stability and health infrastructure to provide care for people sick with Ebola. Aid is still needed where the epidemic started. There needs to be a greater response toward these needs.</p>\n<p>Direct Relief has already sent 19 emergency airlifts of medical resources to more than 1000 local clinics across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. This includes a 747 charter with 100 tons of essential supplies — the largest single airlift to depart the U.S. for West Africa. Direct Relief is sending life-saving supplies not only for the victims of Ebola, but also for doctors and nurses working in the region.</p>\n<p>The paranoia around Ebola is encouraged by doubt. There is reason to fear the virus, but even more reason for proactive steps to stop it at its source. Now, more than ever, we need to lend a hand to nations reeling to contain the virus. UCSB students have the opportunity to join the global community and help. A nonprofit organization is mobilizing a response less than ten minutes away. Direct Relief has been there for West Africa, and will continue to be there for anyone who wants to push for a solution. It took a case in the U.S. for us to become aware of this 40-year-old virus. It’s past time we do something about it.</p>\n<p><em>Brian Carandang is an intern for the Communications Department at Direct Relief. </em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

been covered in online segments of the paper, and that the content selected for print does not necessarily reflect journalistic priorities, we were nonetheless disheartened to see that the only printed coverage of the measure was a full-page advertisement for No on P.  And purposeful or not, readers will inevitably regard material in print with a heightened degree of credence.  We also understand that the advertising department of the Nexus is completely separate from the editorials office, and that as an unbiased news source, the paper cannot discriminate in which ad offers it accepts.</p>\n<p>The fact that No on P asserted themselves in print through a paid advertisement exemplifies their campaign approach — spending nearly $6 million to make this one of the most expensive local ballot initiatives in history.  No one should be surprised that one of the most powerful industries in the world is expending a negligible fraction of their assets to protect future investments.  But what many of us do find appalling is the fact that the heart of the No on P campaign relies on presenting false, misleading scare tactics to crowd out the conversation.<br>\nThe $5.7 million campaign our adversaries have waged locally has inundated our county with an unprecedented amount of misinformation over our airwaves, phone lines and newspaper ads. It’s worth doing some fact checking.<br>\nBecause this proposed measure bans only future<i> </i>well treatment options — specifically just the three most dangerous and carbon-intensive — we should all be clear on this: Measure P will not directly affect existing jobs or tax revenue for our community. It’s easy to pin the wellbeing of our schools or our critical fire and public safety services against this proposed measure, but only if you aren’t committed to remaining truthful.</p>\n<p>Currently, the countywide oil industry — that is, any and all oil extraction techniques — account for just 1% of local jobs and GDP, including indirect impact. This doesn’t account for the negative effects on tourism and decreased property values housing can experience in proximity to oil extraction. And yet, it can’t be stressed enough that because Measure P doesn’t apply to current oil production, none of this tax revenue is relevant to the debate. We caution you not to slip into big oil’s insidious farce.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the oil extracted in our county is of too low a quality to be converted into any sort of energy product, and is thus turned into asphalt.</p>\n<p>Measure P is a ban on “well stimulation treatments,” specifically, cyclic steam injection, acidization and fracking: three separate techniques, but the same in one crucial way. These treatments all require pumping massive amounts of water underground (worst drought in 50 years anyone?) to stimulate the fossil fuel reserve and coax oil out of the ground.  The by-product of this process is an impressive amount of toxic waste, waste that needs to be stored somewhere.  The current go-to place of storage is in underground injection wells — right next to our groundwater (the source of roughly half our drinking water).</p>\n<p>Back in July, the CA Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) shut down eleven injection wells and began investigations on nearly 100 others throughout the state out of concern for the sanctity of nearby groundwater. Earlier this month, the Center for Biological Diversity<a href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2014/fracking-10-06-2014.html\"> confirmed</a> that at least nine of these injection wells were disposing of wastewater directly into groundwater aquifers. Yes, you read correctly.  In nine<i> </i>locations across the state, groundwater was being directly infused with toxic waste.</p>\n<p>While it is true that at the moment there are no active fracking projects in Santa Barbara County, there are many cyclic steam injection sites which carry just as high a risk of toxic contamination.</p>\n<p>Measure P will serve to protect our economy, not hurt it.  But don’t take my word for it.  Go educate yourself — look into the truth about the facts, then get back to me.</p>\n<p><em>This letter has been submitted on behalf of Gauchos Against Fracking </em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

You may remember me from such <em>Gaucho Marks</em> articles as “Queer Spanish Teacher Forces Students To Conjugate Preferred Gender Pronouns” and “Deltopia Sexual Assault Victims Tacitly Agree Now’s Not The Best Time To Mention It.” If not, look them up. I’m sure many of you will experience the same reflexive outrage that readers felt when Gaucho Marks, the humor/satire magazine I founded in my second year, first published them. You were also probably offended by a satirical “Nexustentialism” piece in the <em>Daily Nexus</em> that joked about the Islamic State terrorist group establishing a caliphate in FT. Don’t bother looking that one up, because the editors of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> removed it from the website after what appears to have been a fairly negative Internet reaction.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of an incident a few years back involving the greatest inspiration to both <em>Gaucho Marks</em> and the Nexustentialism section. At the 2013 Academy Awards, the <em>Onion</em>, a Pulitzer-deserving bastion of news satire, live-tweeted the red carpet news coverage of the ceremony. After a close up of “Beasts of the Southern Wild” star and nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, the <em>Onion</em> tweeted, “That Quvenzhane Wallis is kind of a cunt, right?” That tweet caused an enormous backlash on Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, Reddit and probably made for a pretty good icebreaker on Tinder. The outrage reached such a pitch that, for the first time in its 20-year history, the <em>Onion</em> apologized for one of its remarks. A publication that frequently receives threats and cease-and-desist letters for its caustic, satirical content finally caved under the pressure of the online commentariat.</p>\n<p>As an avid fan of the<em> Onion</em>, I was appalled and ashamed. These were the same people that published articles like “School Bully Not So Tough After Being Molested” and “Autistic Child Ruins Marriage He Was Born To Save.” Besides, anybody who really thought about the tweet would have gotten the joke; people are so quick to express hatred towards celebrities merely for the attention they get, so what if those same feelings were directed at a nine-year-old girl? Satire’s core purpose is to expose an issue by caricaturizing it, and the idea that somebody would call a little girl a cunt the same way they’d call Gwyneth Paltrow a cunt is ludicrous. If anything, the Internet’s reaction to the article was proof of its efficacy. But instead of reflecting upon the way they react to celebrity culture, as I’m sure was the tweet’s intent, the great digital hive swarmed to its battle stations and wagged a massive finger at the <em>Onion</em> for even suggesting that Ms. Wallis is a “c-word.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Maybe I’m reading too much into it, and if I’m being honest with myself, the context doesn’t change the fact that the tweet was a pretty weak joke. But the<em> Onion</em> hurt itself by apologizing. Over the past 20 years, The <em>Onion</em> has created its own universe. In this universe, Joe Biden is a beer-swilling, hard-partying Lothario who washes muscle cars in the White House driveway, famous athletes behave like elementary school children and the Royal Baby is the spawn of Satan. The <em>Onion</em>’s apology for the Wallis tweet shattered that universe and reminded us that the <em>Onion</em>, just like every other media outlet, actually exists in a world that punishes weirdoes, hates clowns and feels entitled to the same cozy emotional treatment that babies get (why do you think our generation misses the 90s so much?). Reading that apology was like watching Charlie Chaplin clean up a mess he made in one of his many iconic slapstick scenes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, 600 words into this op-ed and I still haven’t talked about the Nexustentialism piece. “ISIS Seizes FT, Establishes Gaucho Caliphate” is kind of offensive, sure. It’s offensive to a terrorist network that just happens to call itself “Islamic” despite expressing a perverted interpretation of the Quran. However, neither ISIS, nor its victims, are the subject of the joke. What’s funny about ISIS establishing a caliphate in FT is the sentiment that the infamous housing complex is a bacchanalian hell hole that would crumble under so-called Islamic rule (a secondary joke in the piece is that the I.V. Foot Patrol wouldn’t do anything about the caliphate). The only people who should be insulted by the article are ISIS, FT residents and the local police. ISIS will take care of the <em>Nexus</em> once it’s done dealing with the rest of the planet, FT residents probably won’t remember reading this long enough to hold a real grudge and the police can fuck themselves if they don’t like it; they’re the police. If you read the article without really thinking about the subtext, you would assume that it’s merely trivializing the Islamic State’s horrific actions for the sake of humor. However, the article is more effective (yes, <em>Daily Nexus</em> staff, I finally admitted that you know how to do this. Bake your own damn cookies) because it brings that horror to Isla Vista. It’s an example of what’s known as Juvenalian satire, or satire that caricaturizes the darkest aspects of humanity as a means of criticizing them and starting a conversation. The typing tantrum thrown by the <em>Nexus</em> readers clearly demonstrates that it worked.</p>\n<p>“Now, wait a minute, Matt. I doubt the <em>Daily Nexus</em> consciously wrote that piece with social and political justice in mind. I’m pretty sure they just wanted to make an ISIS joke about UCSB and get clicks, much the same way you once used abortion, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and tons of other serious issues to do the same!” You may be right, disgruntled fake person. Let’s assume for a moment that you are. The <em>Daily Nexus</em> made a dumb, exploitative, offensive joke in its satire column. So what? It’s a satire column. It is, by nature, offensive. Furthermore, it’s more offensive to those who deserve ridicule than those who don’t. But rather than stick to their guns and remember the barrels in which their ink is bought, the <em>Daily Nexus</em> decided that being liked was better than being clever. And honestly, I understand that decision, especially in light of the budget cuts the paper has had to make. Would the article really have caused enough of a fuss that advertisers might threaten to close their accounts, as I’m sure they did for the <em>Onion</em> after the Wallis tweet? Or would the backlash have dissipated in days, as it always does, leaving both the <em>Nexus</em> and its easily-bruised readers exactly the same as before?</p>\n<p>Retracting that piece hurts the <em>Daily Nexus</em> even more than apologizing for the Wallis tweet hurt the <em>Onion</em>. It shows that they don’t care about integrity, or intent or even comedy. They care about image. They care more about pandering to their readers than challenging them. It shows that they’re scared of dialogue, and therefore scared of satire. If that’s the case, they shouldn’t be producing it. When I briefly wrote for that same column, my editor imposed many restrictions on the content of my submissions, such as not using the President’s real name (“what about ‘Flobama’? That’s funny, right?”). Satire does not flourish with boundaries. You can’t just apply the same editorial standards to which your journalism adheres to a piece of comedy. It isn’t an easy form of writing, and doing it badly only makes the real news look worse. As Ron Swanson once said, “Don’t half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.” The <em>Princeton Review</em> thought the <em>Daily Nexus</em> was pretty good without the satire column. I say if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve shat upon the<em> Daily Nexus</em> enough, I’ll turn my attention to its pissed-off readers, and the pissed-off readers of <em>Gaucho Marks</em>, and the <em>Onion</em> and any other comic who’s fallen victim to the sonorous whine of the Internet. Do you have any idea how weak you look when you direct your anger at comedians? These are the people trying to make suffering palatable, to spread optimism and perspective into the darkest places, to make you laugh, damn it. When you take that away from them, and from the people who depend on them, you’re damaging the world in ways that ISIS only dreams of. If ISIS knew that Americans were afraid of joking about them, I promise you they’d laugh. They’re laughing now. They’re laughing while they behead and rape people because they know that we won’t do anything about it. We’re too scared. We’re too weak. And it’s your fault. You waste your time haranguing those of us who are trying to whittle away at terror, bit by bit, because you’re too cowardly to do it yourself, too powerless to make real change. Your causes, while just, suffer when you behave this way. Who wants to be championed by someone without the mettle to withstand a joke, especially a bad one? How do you expect to stop injustice when its mere caricature cuts you this deeply? The next time that you see or hear bad satire, ignore it. Or, even better, figure out how to improve upon it. Just don’t blow your next anger-gasm at comedians. They’re doing more for the world than you are.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Javidi is a ‘14 UCSB alumnus and the former Editor of</em> Gaucho Marks.</p>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

And you’ve heard that fracking could be bad. So you did not read all 29 pages of the initiative and you signed because, what harm could it do? Yep, I’ve been there, done that. And while I do believe the people who asked you to sign meant well, the truth is that Measure P is a poorly written initiative that is now on your ballot and will significantly damage the County if voters pass it.</p>\n<p>So what about banning onshore fracking in the County? One company unsuccessfully tried fracking in the County in 2009 and 2010. This led to the rigorous County fracking ordinance that is now in place (as of 2011). Geologists will also tell you the onshore oil deposits in the county are too sandy and are already fissured so fracking won’t work here. So why not ban fracking just to be certain it does not happen in SB County? Because Measure P has a much broader and more damaging scope than just fracking. This initiative asks you to vote to ban all future high-intensity oil operations in the county and shut down current high-intensity operations (projected to occur by 2019). Supporters of P will tell you otherwise, that current operations are unaffected — but just reading the words in the initiative doesn’t tell the whole story. Legal interpretation is required to understand “vested rights,” “takings” and specific legal history relevant to the County and State. Not being an attorney myself, I rely on attorneys to explain legal language. What I found is only one attorney, who co-wrote P, says P won’t cause a shutdown. All other legal opinions disagree, including the neutral County attorney. He has gone on record stating the language of the initiative leaves the County exposed to litigation that the County does not have insurance coverage for, and if he could rewrite the initiative to protect the County, he would. But he doesn’t have that option.</p>\n<p>Reduced or eliminated oil production in the County means 1) less tax revenues that benefit schools and services (e.g., fire), 2) less oil jobs in the County and State and 3) less revenue to businesses who serve the oil community (hotels, restaurants, gas stations). Can SB County afford these losses?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There’s simply too much collateral damage that comes with Measure P.

I care about my impact on the planet and stay educated about the ways that I can be more carbon-conscious. One thing I know for certain is that whenever possible, using locally sourced goods, labor and materials is better for the environment and our local economy.  Unfortunately, the supporters of Measure P have forgotten that. Measure P would require us to shift our reliance from domestically produced oil towards less regulated and more carbon-expensive oil imports from other countries. Santa Barbara County, the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, has some of the world’s most stringent environmental regulations on oil production. This being the case, in my opinion, as long as there exists an overwhelming demand for oil in our country we should be moving towards energy independence by producing it from tightly regulated, domestic sources in order to minimize costs and maximize environmental safety.Measure P supporters have taken tousing scare tactics, talking about the threat of fracking here in Santa Barbara, when the truth is no fracking takes place in Santa Barbara because the geological make-up of the naturally fractured Monterey Formation makes the use of hydraulic-fracturing unnecessary and therefore unprofitable; hence, no fracking permits have even been applied for in Santa Barbara County. Additionally, if Measure P were to pass it would choke off hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity including funding that supports public schools and various other local governmental agencies. Understanding the fact that the environment does not solely exist on a local scale but rather on global scale provides the grounds for realizing that the passing of Measure P is not a solution to curing our oil dependence but rather acts as an exasperator of environmental and economic damage. I’m going to vote No on Measure P.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>Sam Bever</em><em> is a fourth-year</em> <em>economics major.</em></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Wasn’t my high school diploma enough? Shouldn’t I just get a job and start a family? In our community and many others, this is typically regarded as the path for a Latino male. But I knew my path would be different.  Excitement does not begin to describe how I felt when I was accepted to the University of California, Santa Barbara. I had the chance to live in the dorms, join sports, participate in many extra-curricular activities and study abroad in Paris. In short, I had the best time of my life.</p>\n<p>Now, as an assistant principal in L.A., I spend my days working to ensure that other students who share my background have access to these great life experiences. I first began to realize that education was the place for me during my years at UCSB, when I had the chance to visit a number of local public schools — a few miles down the road but worlds away from our pristine quads and classrooms. Seeing the discrepancies in academic achievement and facilities connected directly to the classes I’d been taking and ignited my interest for social justice. As I learned more, I began to view the classroom as the singular most powerful place to have the kind of impact I imagined.</p>\n<p>By the time I graduated, I had a degree in Sociology and Political Science, a minor in Education, and a focus on Immigration, Critical Race Theory and Education Reform. From there, I began to teach. And it was during my four years in the classroom (then another as principal teacher in residence) that my academic interest in education transformed into a deep, abiding passion. I went on to earn my master’s in Education Policy and Administration from Loyola Marymount University and now serve as assistant principal at PUC Community Charter Middle School in the San Fernando Valley, very close to where I grew up. Every day, I feel blessed to be able to give back to the community that gave me so much.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a first-generation Mexican-American and the first college graduate in my immediate family, I am very proud to be helping others realize what’s possible through education. Most powerful of all, today, my family takes pride in my decision to pursue higher education and by how motivated I’ve become to make a difference in this world.</p>\n<p>Looking at my students, I see so much of myself, from the community and culture we share to the challenges we’ve faced. In my own academic life, I’ve questioned if I had what it took to be successful. Studying never came easy to me and there were so many cultural messages pulling me away from applying myself in school. But I also know what is now possible for me because I did. If my students internalize one thing, I hope it will be this.</p>\n<p>Today, I bring my personal story, along with my identity as first-generation Mexican- American and college graduate, to school with me. As a leader, I bring all these elements and hold the mirror up to my students, staff and families. Every day we are faced with obstacles — some small and direct, others stemming from larger systemic oppressions. I’m proud to stand as a living example for the many families I have come to meet and love over the years that college doesn’t have to be a dream. Together, we can make it a reality.</p>\n<p>In all of this, the role of committed educators cannot be overstated. As Hispanic Heritage month comes to a close, I hope we’ll remember the unique role for classroom and school leadership in the broader fight for equity and opportunity. Every day, my colleagues and I are privileged to help shape the minds and futures of our next generation. As you imagine your own future, I hope you’ll join us.</p>\n<p><i>Claudio Estrada ‘09 is an assistant principal in Los Angeles and 2010 Teach For America alumnus.</i></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion Page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

A crowd of 400,000, four times more than the most generous expected attendance, flooded the streets of Manhattan, celebrating our unity and demanding action. Among those 400,000 were ten UCSB students and five alumni who came together to represent UC Santa Barbara at the march. I was one of them. Our group ranged from a freshman taking her first step in environmental activism to a graduate student and alumnus who are deeply involved with groups like the Environmental Affairs Board and the California Student Sustainability Coalition.</p>\n<p>The march, dubbed the People’s Climate March, was endorsed by more than 1,000 environmental and social justice organizations. It was intended to be a public call for action on climate change from world leaders and planned to coincide with the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Summit that took place in New York City two days later.</p>\n<p>Talking about climate change can be disheartening, especially when we focus on all the effects it seems to already be wreaking on this planet. This march had the opposite effect. For me and everyone I encountered there, this march empowered us and gave us a new sense of hope in the face of this crisis. We chanted, smiled and embraced fellow marchers in a joyful display of unity across the huge diversity of those represented, from workers unions, indigenous groups and religious organizations to student groups like ours. The event took on a more somber tone when at 12:58 p.m., silence filled the air as the crowd linked hands overhead and took a moment to remember those who have suffered or are already suffering at the hands of climate change and the fossil fuel industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At 1:00 p.m. however, a wave of sound rose from one end of the march to the other as participants sounded the alarm on climate change, an alarm scientists have been sounding since at least 1988. It was what Bill McKibben called, “the burglar alarm on those who are trying to steal our future.” The sense of community felt among participants was awe-inspiring. We were all there together to demand action and say that these issues are everyone’s issues.</p>\n<p>“When the march began, I didn’t think it was possible for so many people marching, singing and beating drums, to suddenly fall silent,” said Leah Schulman, one of the Gauchos with me. “But when it came, you could hear a pin drop. The only thing more powerful than that silence was the rush of noise that came after.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the masses that gathered in New York City, 2,646 solidarity events took place the same weekend in 162 countries, including several in California. What is evident from these events is that there is a global movement to fight climate change and that it is the “front-line communities” — indigenous groups, island nations and those already affected by climate change — that are at the forefront of it.</p>\n<p>Climate justice was a leading theme of the march, since it is countries that have contributed the least to climate change who, so far, are seeing its effects the most strongly. It was inspiring to see dozens of people from island nations and communities from the Ecuadorian Amazon lead the march. These people’s homes and ultimately lives are at stake — when disaster strikes they have nowhere else to go and often do not have the resources to adapt to the changing environment. It is critical for us to join in solidarity with those already affected by climate change, even if we have yet to witness the consequences of climate change in our own lives.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the event from which we all drew inspiration was the number of university students represented. Including those of us from UCSB, it is estimated that more than 50,000 university students took part in the event. This is not surprising, for the divestment from fossil fuels campaign that has spread across the nation began with college student activists. It has now grown to such strength that the Rockefellers, who owe their immense wealth to oil, have recently pledged to divest their funds from the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>It was uplifting to engage with students from universities across the country and learn about all of their campaigns, including divestment aimed at fighting the fossil fuel industry and the influence it has over our democracy. It can be easy for individuals to feel disempowered but this march did the opposite. We gained a sense of the magnitude of the fossil fuel divestment movement that is taking place at hundreds of universities across the United States and the enormous strides it has already taken in changing the public’s opinions of the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the march, it is critical to understand what this means for ourselves and for our community here at UCSB. As university students, we enjoy a privileged position in society and must use this to bring light to the struggle of frontline communities in the face of climate change. It is our responsibility to speak out on the environmental injustices that are being wrought against our generation and generations to follow.</p>\n<p>One way of doing this is by demanding that our university divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry. While this alone is not enough to slow climate change, if the entire University of California system were to do so it would send a message to the nation, perhaps the world, that investment in fossil fuels is no longer a viable option for those interested in preserving a livable climate for our own and future generations.</p>\n<p>With 400,000 people at the People’s Climate March, the event has been considered an overwhelming success. However, the true success stems from the empowerment individuals gained through this march to return to their communities and enact change, however small or big that may be. Whether that means composting or becoming active in one of UCSB’s 40 environmental groups, it is up to individuals how involved they want to be in this movement. There is a UC fossil fuel divestment campaign active at UCSB where students are always welcomed and encouraged to get involved in through the Environmental Affairs Board. Students should stay informed about the upcoming mid-term election in Nov. and the “Healthy Air and Water Initiative,” otherwise known as Measure P, which would “effectively ban extreme fossil fuel extraction in Santa Barbara county.”</p>\n<p>The People’s Climate March was an inspiring and empowering demonstration of an active democracy and if you would like to hear more about our experience there, please come to our presentation at the Environmental Affairs Board meeting at 7 p.m. on Oct. 15. We will share personal anecdotes, photos and videos from the People’s Climate March and give more information about how to get involved in the solutions that have been proposed to combat climate change. We hope to see you there.</p>\n<p>Fighting climate change will be a long and arduous task but if our generation does not do it, then who will?</p>\n<p><em>Katie Koerper is a fourth-year Communications &amp; Global Studies major</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

The cohesion and camaraderie were present among the participants and many realized that the needed changes will have to start at the local level. And Santa Barbara County voters will have their chance on Nov. 4 to be a part of the climate change solution. This will be our opportunity to really have a distinct impact in a fight that often seems removed and out of proportion with what is achievable at the local level.</p>\n<p>A measure to ban fracking and other high-intensity petroleum production in Santa Barbara County, Measure P, is on the November ballot. Whether Measure P passes or not will likely determine greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade in our county, a critical period during which we need to reduce emissions in order to head off the worst impacts of climate change. This is a period during which we must take the opportunity to change our energy use patterns and quickly transition towards clean (carbon-free) and renewable types of energy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Measure P proposes a ban on high-intensity oil production including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which water, chemicals and sand are blasted underground to break up the rock and extract oil, and acidizing, which adds hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the rock to extract oil and cyclic steam injection, which uses large amounts of water, steam and energy to heat the thick, heavy oil so it will flow more readily. There are many local environmental concerns with these techniques which can lead to air pollution and water contamination, and expansion of these techniques as is proposed for our country would also lead to large increases in greenhouse gas emissions in the county.</p>\n<p>Oil companies are already planning to drill thousands of wells in our county for oil that is extremely carbon intensive, the burning of which would add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere equivalent to adding nearly a million cars on our roads. Santa Barbara County should instead reduce its greenhouse emission in alignment with Californian and national efforts — not the opposite.</p>\n<p>Of serious concern is the underground injection of wastewater produced by these high-water intensity practices as such injection has been linked to increased seismic activity. While this underground injection is administered and overseen by the Department of Conservation and the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), this oversight has been criticized by the EPA and considered deficient. In a county bordered by the San Andreas Fault to the East, intersected by the San Ynez and More Ranch faults and bounded by the Hosgri and Shoreline fault just offshore of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant upwind of Santa Barbara, such weak oversight should concern our citizens.</p>\n<p>Cyclic steam injection, the most employed technique in our county requires tremendous amounts of water, and super-heating that water to 500 degrees requires large amounts of energy. It makes no sense to promote a massive ramp-up of water-intensive processes in the middle of what may soon become the worst drought in recorded California history.</p>\n<p>Measure P, if passed, would protect the air, water and environment that make the county a desirable place to work and live. It will protect the county from outside speculators who will leave as soon as their oil exploitation is not profitable any longer, leaving us with the cost of environmental remediation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County should take a lead in rejecting the most polluting forms of oil production and transitioning to clean sources of energy. Of all the things we can do locally in regard to climate change, this would have the highest impact and is critically important at this time. The stakes could not be greater — our actions now will determine the future livability of the planet.</p>\n<p>Vote Yes on P!</p>\n<p><em>Catherine Gautier is a Professor Emerita in UCSB’s Geography Department</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/yes-on-measure-p/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/yes-on-measure-p/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/yes-on-measure-p/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/yes-on-measure-p/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/yes-on-measure-p/","id":5777,"author":{"id":413,"name":"Catherine Gautier"},"related":[5776,5775,5774],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alumnus’ Open Letter to Current Students","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Alumnus Isaac Villa addresses members of the UCSB and Isla Vista communities.

This is not just a new chapter for all of you, but for UCSB and Isla Vista as a whole. This community has changed dramatically in my four years here. Restaurants have come and gone, there are two banks with actual tellers and not just ATMs, and about 1,000 new pizza places. But that’s just I.V.: it’s always changing.</p>\n<p>It’s the ever-shifting nature of Isla Vista that makes us so unique and wonderful to be around, but it is also our biggest weakness. I.V. has an extremely short memory. Things happen here and then we move on as if they never did. I don’t want that to happen.

As my friends, classmates and I were preparing for finals and graduation; the happiness, stress and anticipation that comes with it all vanished overnight. They were replaced by sadness, pain and confusion. Places I walked by every day to get to class went from familiar and welcoming to strange and distant. I have a heavy heart whenever I walk down Pardall for some food. I hold back tears as I turn onto Seville and pass by the Capri Apartments on my way to get groceries from the Food Co-op. I stare at the candle wax-stained sidewalks where our memorials once lay. It’s been over four months and I.V. has recovered, but not healed.</p>\n<p>All of you new Gauchos are entering into a family that is still in mourning and still broken, as we always will be. There is no mending the wounds we were dealt, or erasing the sadness that overcame us. For you new Gauchos, May 23, 2014 is an abstract date, connected to events you know about but ones you didn’t experience. It’s easier for you to see this day from a distance, but for those of us that were here, it isn’t. I will never forget the panicked texts I got while I was at work. I will never find such relief in seeing a friend post on Facebook, because that proves they’re alive. I will never forget the silence that overcame I.V. on May 24, when I walked with my community through the streets of I.V. — a silence that Hannah-Beth Jackson requested to never hear again as we gathered to mourn. I will always remember the love I felt in each hug that I gave and was given in the days and weeks after. I will always feel the unity that I.V. had. I will always accept the challenge given to us by Richard Martinez: Not One More.</p>\n<p>That is why I am writing this letter to you. Not one more is a mantra that cannot be forgotten or limited to gun violence. UCSB and Isla Vista need to integrate it into all aspects of life. Not one more member of our community should be senselessly gunned down. Not one more member of our community should be sexually assaulted. Not one more time will UCSB be in the news for anything but our accomplishments.</p>\n<p>That’s up to each and every one of you. New and returning. Create the campus and community that reaps greatness. Go out and have fun! Enjoy your time in paradise. But remember to respect one another. Remember that you are not entitled to anything or anyone. We all deserve to be treated as equals. That’s what it means to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p><em>Isaac Villa graduated from UCSB in 2014</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.
