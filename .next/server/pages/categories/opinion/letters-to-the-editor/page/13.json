There has, in reality, been only minor variance with the economic policies employed by past administrations.</p>\n<p>Like his predecessors, from President George W. Bush to President Ronald Reagan, the Commander-in-Chief has employed a rather conservative economic plan — basic Keynesianism.</p>\n<p>It is a matter of fact that in our American two-party system, as John Cassidy of The New Yorker writes, “The real policy debate isn’t about Keynesianism versus the free market, it is about magnitudes and techniques: How much stimulus is necessary? And how should it be divided between government spending and tax cuts?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the economy hesitates and consumer-spending declines, government forces supplementary demand into the economy with a spend-then-tax policy. It offsets the decline in private spending with an increase in public spending.</p>\n<p>The early 1980s saw President Reagan doing precisely this by increasing defense spending while simultaneously cutting taxes. In the first years of the new millennium, President W. Bush also utilized this method when he entered a couple of wars and launched extensive tax cuts.</p>\n<p>In early 2009, President Obama introduced his stimulus. It’s important to note that the $800 billion stimulus program known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was smaller than many Keynesian economists suggested. According to Nobel Prize winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, the then chair of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, Christina Romer, initially advocated a $1.8 trillion deal.</p>\n<p>The stimulus package accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009, 2.4 percent in 2010 and 1.2 percent in 2011. Cassidy continues, “So far, some $750 billion in stimulus money has been paid out: about $300 billion went to tax breaks for individuals and firms; roughly $235 billion was dispersed in the form of government contracts, grants and loans and another $225 billion was spent on entitlements — unemployment benefits, Medicaid, food stamps and so on.”</p>\n<p>Nothing catastrophic. No draconian changes. Just good, old-fashioned, Keynesian, free-market economics.</p>\n<p><em>Chase Wilson is a UCSB alumnus who majored in political science.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-07-12/obamas-stimulus-package-break-tradition-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-07-12/obamas-stimulus-package-break-tradition-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-07-12/obamas-stimulus-package-break-tradition-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-07-12/obamas-stimulus-package-break-tradition-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-07-12/obamas-stimulus-package-break-tradition-2/","id":6021,"author":{"id":542,"name":"Chase Wilson"},"related":[6020,6019,6018],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Responds to “Anti-Steve” Voter Fraud Allegations","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Do you believe everything you read or hear?

With the elections coming up, it is important that we utilize our powers of independent thinking and critical reasoning. In the Daily Nexus and on campus, students have accused 3rd District Supervisor candidate Steve Pappas of attempting to deny the students of UCSB and residents of Isla Vista their right to vote. These allegations against Pappas are completely unfounded and without merit. The truth is, in the 2008 elections for County Supervisor between Steve Pappas and Doreen Farr, voter turnout in Isla Vista was 101 percent. In one of the precincts, it was a whopping 130 percent. Pappas realized that something was clearly wrong and that these resulting numbers were simply not possible, unless voter irregularities had occurred. Therefore, he asked for a re-count; this is where the confusion began.</p>\n<p>Asking for a re-count is the right of any candidate running for public office and is completely different from throwing votes out. The accusations that Pappas wanted votes thrown out are absolutely untrue and ridiculous. In asking for a re-count, Pappas was able to obtain backup documentation regarding votes cast in the precincts that showed over 100 percent voter turnout. The civil case led to a criminal investigation and the sheriff’s report concluded that numerous felonies had been committed, including voter fraud, forgery and identity fraud.</p>\n<p>However, many student voters don’t know this because anti-Steve campaigners do not reveal this information. Their low-blow propaganda against Pappas — incessantly calling him a sore loser and rudely holding up signs next to Pappas reading “Scumbag” — are disrespectful and in bad taste; not to mention, these allegations have nothing to do with the actual facts and issues at hand. I hope that all of you will take it upon yourselves to learn about Pappas rather than immediately buying into everything you read or hear. I expect that any adult would evaluate their options before making any important decisions in their lives. With that being said, these people that are trashing Pappas consider themselves open-minded and informed voters, yet most of them have neither met nor spoken to him. On occasion, I have even asked several of these students to voice their concerns to Pappas personally, which they refused. This, in my opinion, certainly classifies them as closed-minded and uninformed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pappas has every right to run and it’s ironic that th Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

They do this because they are afraid that the truth will come out. Many students have had preconceived notions about Pappas because of what they have heard; and after all the horrible things said about him, how could they not? However, after speaking with Pappas personally and hearing his side of the story, almost all of them have changed their opinions about him. In fact, many are shocked and even embarrassed that they had allowed themselves to be so gullible and closed-minded.</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to say is, don’t reject Steve Pappas before you know him. Be an independent thinker. I encourage everyone to keep an open mind and take the initiative to get informed. Pappas is on campus nearly every day of the week to speak with the students.

We were somewhat out of our element, donned in work pants, gloves and wide-brimmed hats, on Don Israel’s farm in the small village of Ciudad Romero, El Salvador. With the sun approaching high noon, the heat made it hard work digging even a few feet of the ditch that would hold the piping for the irrigation system to be installed on the farm. Sydney Bennet — a first-year economics major at UCSB and “water-girl” for the day — called for everyone to take a break from working to hydrate. We layed down our tools and as we headed for our water bottles, the community leaders overseeing the irrigation project picked up the tools and continued work on the ditch.

Wouldn’t the money spent traveling to that country be put to better use hiring native workers who desperately need the money or building infrastructure that the community desperately needs?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The American Jewish World Service (AJWS) attempts to answer these questions by transforming the short-term volunteer service trip into a learning experience. An organization inspired by Judaism’s commitment to social justice, AJWS strives to secure human rights and eradicate poverty around the world through grants, service trips, education and political advocacy. Alternative Spring Break trips are just one of the many service-learning travel opportunities offered by AJWS. Twelve students (including myself) recruited from UCSB and SBCC by Santa Barbara Hillel participated in an AJWS alternative Spring Break trip to El Salvador this past March.</p>\n<p>We knew we were going to a small village in El Salvador to do some sort of manual labor, but I don’t think anyone was fully aware of the type of experience AJWS had in mind. During orientation meetings we prepared for the physical labor aspect of the trip as well as the cultural side. We participated in activities designed to stimulate our cultural awareness and encourage us to immerse ourselves in the culture of the village. “Embrace the feeling of being uncomfortable,” they told us.</p>\n<p>Each day we were bused over to the farm and given tools to dig ditches for the irrigation pipes and holes for mango trees to be planted. It is rare to see a work project through to completion on an AJWS Spring Break trip, but we were fortunate enough to see the entire process of irrigating a farm.</p>\n<p>From AJWS’s point of view, however, the crux of the trip lays not in the labor but in afternoon and nightly discussion sessions aimed at getting us to reflect on our experiences and explore the meaning of social justice. Using a curriculum filled with Jewish texts and commentaries on global responsibility as our guide, we questioned our notions about global inequality and what our obligation really is to those in the world who are less fortunate than us. We learned about what it means to be in poverty, its causes and ways that we can help improve the quality of living for those in it. Through group dialogues we gradually came to understand that coming to El Salvador just to dig a few holes wasn’t doing enough. Rather, we’d be doing a greater good by learning as much as we could about the village and what makes it tick — what the biggest concerns are for its people and how they can thrive.</p>\n<p>As the week progressed, we began to develop a sense of the daily concerns of the village, not the least of which included U.S. policy toward Latin America. We were also fortunate enough to meet with Estela Hernandez, a woman from the Lempa River valley deeply involved in the work of La Coordinadora (a local organzation that oversaw our work), who was elected to the Salvadoran legislature a few weeks before our trip. When asked about her top political goals for her term in office, Estela responded that her top priority was to alert other nations — the U.S. in particular — to the issues affecting her people, and that she was grateful to have students from the U.S. come to learn about her community.</p>\n<p>These experiences helped drive home the point that we were there not to simply visit and then leave, but to bring back with us what we had learned and continue to help by gathering support for a just U.S. Farm Bill that promotes food sustainability in foreign countries as opposed to food aid, a short-term fix that undercuts local farmers.</p>\n<p>But not everyone was as grateful to have us there as Estela was. A sobering moment on the trip came when we visited a clinician’s office to learn about their health care system and kidney disease, which affects a disproportionate number of workers in Central America. We sat in the clinician’s office and asked her an assortment of questions about how health care works in the village. She gave long-winded explanations on topics such as who the clinic serves, how she became a doctor and what treatments she gives. When it came time for her to ask us questions, she only had one: “Why are you here?” Our group leaders’ answers about service and learning did not seem to satisfy her. She responded that it was puzzling to her how we could come for only a week and expect to have any impact, that we could do more by staying longer and teaching the local youth about hygiene and sexually transmitted diseases. As we continued to struggle to give her an answer she liked, her piercing gaze slowly diminished us and broke our hearts.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the clinician was right. Perhaps short-term volunteer trips have no point and are used more as an opportunity for us to travel the world than as a means to help. We did not need to be in El Salvador in order to learn about poverty, social justice, global responsibility and farming. Yet, each one of us was changed by the experience we had in the village. We went home feeling connected to El Salvador and to the people with whom we had spent each of our days there. You cannot connect with a group of people or learn what makes a village breathe by reading a book. You need to go there, eat their food, sleep in their homes and wake up to the sound of their roosters. You need to experience their daily work in the fields, put your hands in their soil and feel the singe of their scorching sun.</p>\n<p><em>Danny Sheinson is a third-year graduate student in statistics.</em></p>\n<p><em>For more information, please visit www.ajws.org or contact Santa Barbara Hillel.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

In fact, I hate it, and I always have. Whether it is house, techno, dubstep, trance or techno-house-step eurotrance, for me it all falls under the umbrella term of annoying white noise. My personal philosophy is that anything driven by bleeps, bloops, womps, oontzes or any combination thereof should be left out of the music category. Given my relentless distaste for such sounds, one could understandably assume that I did not care for Wolfgang Gartner’s performance at Extravaganza this weekend. As his set progressed, however, I found myself enjoying more and more the spectacle that was unfolding before me.</p>\n<p>As Wolfgang took the stage to play, my first instinct was to flee Harder Stadium and seek recluse in the safety of my apartment. Determined to at least try to broaden my horizons, I decided to simply retreat to the bleachers where I could observe the show from a safer distance. I went close to the very top, and had an excellent view of the mob that was quickly building up in anticipation of the coming storm. Many of my friends listen to electronic music, so I had heard a few of Wolfgang’s songs and thought I knew what to expect from him. What I witnessed next was, surprisingly, one of the most beautiful performances I have seen.</p>\n<p>I quickly realized that watching this type of music performed live in front of a huge crowd is much different than listening to it from a car stereo. Armed with his various synthesizers and sequencers, Wolfgang controlled the ebbs and flows of hundreds of onlookers with the prowess of an experienced puppet master. There was something transfixing about the way he could make them step, wave their arms, or jump in unison, all without uttering a word. While watching the crazed dances of a few ecstasy-driven concertgoers, the thought crossed my mind that this was probably the happiest moments they would ever experience, and I was honored to witness it. During one bass drop in particular, the collective orgasm that the crowd felt even sent shivers down my spine.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps my favorite part of Wolfgang Gartner’s performance was the fact that, out of everyone attending, he was clearly the one who enjoyed it the most. Too often do I see artists put on a half-assed show so they can collect their check and move on (certain Extravaganza headliners come to mind). In this case, the crowd fed off of Wolfgang’s energy, and it made the whole experience better. He was excited, which made the crowd excited, which made me excited. It was all very exciting.</p>\n<p>Coming out of Extravaganza, I could not say that I would be attending a rave anytime soon. Nor could I say that I liked electronic music anymore because of it. What I did gain was a better understanding of why this craze has swept the country over the past few years, especially within Isla Vista. There was a glimmer of hope that one day I might learn to appreciate these noises.</p>\n<p><em>Piers Fibige is a third-year political science and history major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/","id":6018,"author":{"id":505,"name":"PiersFibige"},"related":[6017,6016,6015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Origins of Sin: a Review of Religious History","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In his column “Why Religion May Be a Matter of Ideology, Not Theology,” Mr. Schenck claims that the Christian concept of sin originated in Old English etymology.

But here’s a reality check: the Jewish religion had the idea of “sin” thousands of years before Christianity. About 4,000 years ago, Moses wrote the book of Genesis, which traces the lineage of Israel back to the first man, Adam, who committed the first sin.</p>\n<p>So sin is a Jewish idea, not a European one. In the account of the Garden of Eden, Adam underwent a trial of obedience. He was a perfect man without sin, created with the free will to choose good or evil. When he chose evil, sin entered the world and caused all men to die.</p>\n<p>Because of Adam’s sin, all his offspring inherited the legal guilt of his disobedience, causing all men to become sinful from conception. As King David wrote in Psalm 51, “In sin did my mother conceive me.” The Hebrew scriptures understood death as a divine punishment for sinful acts. So why do babies die when they have not even lived long enough to make a conscious choice of evil? Because they are incriminated by Adam’s guilt as well. And the sin and guilt that is transferred to them creates a fallen state of “original sin,” so that people are born into a sinful condition where they only desire to choose rebellion against God.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That is why the prophet Jeremiah describes the human heart as “desperately wicked.” In Psalm 14, the psalmist despairs, “The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who … seek after God. [But] they have all turned aside … there is none who does good, not even one.” All because Adam fell by his own free will.</p>\n<p>Again, this is not a European idea, but a Jewish one — what theologians call “Federal Headship.” One man’s obedience or disobedience represents the entire race. The federal head either damns or saves all of his offspring, which is why God promised to Adam, as well as to Abraham, that a “seed” would come from their line who would save the race from death.</p>\n<p>That seed was Jesus Christ, the second Adam. God Himself took on flesh. Conceived of a virgin by the Holy Spirit, He was born without original sin. He carried out Adam’s trial perfectly, never sinning once, but perfectly obeying the law of God. Then He submitted to death on a cross, where He was credited the sin of His chosen people. He paid for every sin they committed, and committed in Adam, in blood, canceling their guilt. And then He rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven to rule until the coming judgment.</p>\n<p>Who represents you — Adam or Jesus Christ? Everyone who is represented by Adam will be judged as guilty, but everyone who is represented by Christ will be judged as perfect. So I urge you to believe in what Christ has done for you, for “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Rom 10:9).</p>\n<p><em>Steven Begakis is a fourth-year political science and economics major.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

The petition being signed to get rid of the UCen TVs is just another example of bratty kids wanting to get their bratty way.</p>\n<p>If you want your silence, go to the Arts Library, which is less than 100 yards away from the UCen. If you need to study, set up camp in Davidson Library. If you need to meet with a group for a project, go to the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The UCSB campus is chock-full of options for every student need. If you want to eat lunch and to take a break from your classes, THAT is when you go to the UCen! Now, I am by no means saying that you can’t study at the UCen. I do it all the time! However, I sit there fully aware of the fact that it is not a space where I am allowed to demand silence. I chose to sit there and I will live with the fact that it isn’t quiet. There is a similar trend of a**holes who glare at you in Starbucks when you and your roommate DARE to crack jokes in line. I’m sorry, did I miss the sign that said “Library” on the door? No. I didn’t.

Yeah, that’s a verb in the form of a gerund. So what? I’ll probably use it as a noun later, quite possibly an adverb, but that’s not why we’re here. If you don’t know what YOLO is, then I hope you’re suffering from a serious case of FOMO right now.</p>\n<p>YOLO, as a lifestyle choice, has completely revolutionized every activity in my day. Sometimes I’m at the grocery store and I find myself in the produce aisle jones-ing some yams, when suddenly I begin YOLO-ing. I transform into a state of heightened consciousness where everything becomes awesome. Slow-moving woman on the power chair, you get that bread! A box of cereal, thank you! Cookies, why not? YOLO. Later, as the feelings of YOLO have fully subsided, they hit me again while I’m doing laundry. Spinning clothes: mesmerizing. Homeless man with a surprisingly large wardrobe, how you doing bud? After discovering YOLO, the mundane has become fascinating and all of life’s little chores a bit brighter.</p>\n<p>Quite simply, I’m surprised I made it through my first 21 years without the powers of YOLO. It’s more than a saying and more than a thought; it’s a spirit — a spirit that’s all about gleefulness and just having a blast. But who gave us YOLO you ask? I’ll try to give you a little rundown on what I believe to be the origin and subsequent evolution of YOLO.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The concept has been around as long as humans have, but only recently has the YOLO we know and love come into existence. The Romans gave us carpe diem, but that’s not quite it. The counterculture ’60s put an acidic twist on it, but we weren’t quite there yet. The obvious question is: Who birthed the YOLO revolution? Drake tells us YOLO is the motto but that we already knew the essence of YOLO. How did we know? Did I miss the memo? These are questions that kept me occupied when Drake first told me to YOLO.</p>\n<p>Only recently have I come to fully understand YOLO and it’s pretty much imperative that you do too. I came to UCSB in 2008 (eons ago, I know), and I still like to pretend that Bieber didn’t exist during that golden age. I spent my freshman and sophomore year, like most of us here, in a relative stupor. I lived for the weekends sprinkled with some Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I did the school thing, dabbled in some extracurricular activities, but I never really got engaged in the UCSB community. Frankly, Sundays became a depressing ritual because the only thing I really looked forward to was usually four days away. Don’t get me wrong; going out and getting a little boozed up was incredibly fun most nights, but I felt unfulfilled. Now looking back on it with the infinite wisdom provided to me by YOLO, I know I wasn’t YOLO-ing.</p>\n<p>As a departing senior, spare a moment to heed my advice. UCSB has undoubtedly been the greatest experience of my life and saying that I have regrets would feel a little disingenuous. But if I could run these four years back, there are definitely some things I would do that I missed out on the first time around. I would join a few clubs to meet more people with common interests. I would stress less about school and realize that it’s not the grades we’re here for, but rather the knowledge we’re receiving. Most importantly, I would approach every day with a little more optimism and, finally, I would try to enjoy even the most trivial things. The four years here will fly by faster than you could ever believe. Take every opportunity to challenge yourself, to expand your circle or find a new hobby. If you’re interested in it, UCSB probably has it. Make yourself take that first step. It’s probably the toughest to, but it’s all downhill from there. So if these words aren’t enough, remember: YOLO.</p>\n<p>Jake Schurmeier is fourth-year political science major.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

Most of them have been to academic advising at least once this month and are on a first-name basis with their respective undergraduate advisor. These students reveal their innermost fears about choosing a major and what their lives will become as a result.</p>\n<p>But what forces us to constrain our curiosity to only one discipline of choice? Obviously I’m not opting for some hippie-style program where it’s possible to study anything we desire, whether the topics relate at all. Instead, I’m hoping that the objective of higher education shifts back to its original aims. Back in the day (let’s say the ‘70s), tuition at UC schools was a mere $600 per year. The purpose of college is to pursue something that you really enjoy, yet, with budget cuts, tuition hikes and department specialization, it becomes difficult to pursue something you really love (unless, of course, you’re one of those lucky enough to have already discovered your passions). It’s easier than ever to “explore your interests” with Google searches, Facebook pages and blogs, but it’s harder than ever to successfully crash a class and fit non-major courses into your schedule. Why, in contemporary times, do we sacrifice the opportunity for comprehensive knowledge by opting for specialization? Why is the opportunity for interdisciplinary studies so limited? If anything, the borders of disciplines blur now more than ever as a result of growing technology and globalization.</p>\n<p>A surge of independence flows through us when we enter into a higher education institution. The opportunity to make an infinite amount of decisions at our own discretion presents itself daily. A typical student is faced with choices like: “Should I smoke a bowl before class? Should I even go to class? It’s hot, should I go to the beach instead of class?” I’m kidding. UCSB students have a lot more going for them than the predictable stereotypes, which are a likely product of cold-weather students’ envy. With only an average of 20 years and a high school diploma under our belts, most of us have no idea what we want to do for the rest of our lives.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The overwhelming presentation of college doesn’t help either. The worst is the inevitable question of, “So what are you planning on doing with [insert major here]?” The majority of students would love to answer that question with “I have no idea” and be done with it. But, it doesn’t work like that … at all. Think about how nice it would be to major in something you love, and even better, to major in a bunch of things you love.</p>\n<p>The whole point I’m trying to convey is: Pursue what you love. If it’s not offered, then find a way to do it anyway. The interdisciplinary program and independent major program present the rare opportunity to study what interests you, to an extent. Now, I’m not proposing that each of you change to an interdisciplinary major. I am merely highlighting the increase in specialization that has extinguished cross-disciplinary studies within some departments. An education should be well rounded, so choose something from which you’ll actually learn a thing or two and something that will have a positive impact on your life. Our future is important and your major matters in some sense. So next time you or your friends are freaking out about your future, just keep in mind that there are a lot of options out there.</p>\n<p><em>Lindsey O’Hara is a second year undeclared major. </em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

Not simply because the words “skank” and “prude” always get my blood boiling, but also because, as a native San Franciscan, I instantly wanted to defend my beloved city. How, I wondered, could this young woman have been so misled about the city’s identity? Perhaps if Miss Chack had utilized her formative years to do a little more exploring outside the Catholic monolith, she might have discovered San Francisco to be what it is for most of its inhabitants — not only the intersection of gay culture and Haight-Ashbury, but the epicenter of sex positivity.</p>\n<p>In the interest of avoiding deterrent feminist jargon, I’ll describe “sex positivity” as an outlook that champions sexual freedom and a lack of judgment. College is a time when we come into our own (pun intended), learn how to see ourselves within the world and, in the case of male readers, within our chosen sexual partners. But I think in order to really reap the bounty of this experience, it’s important to stop judging ourselves. I applaud Miss Chack’s newfound sexual freedom, but in the words of Tina Fey, “You’ve got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.”</p>\n<p>As you can tell from my chronically bombastic diction, I had a rough time in high school. I came into college with similar notions to Miss Chack — if you’re going to be sexual, do it behind closed doors; intelligence is inconsistent with “sluttiness,” and other such bullshit. I quickly found myself facing glazed eyes at frat parties whenever I used polysyllabic words and decided that I was now in a community where one could be “hot and dumb” or smart. After a year of admonitions from my friends for excessive ironic comments and wearing weather-appropriate footwear, I began to use my time standing awkwardly in corners at parties to contemplate my worth as a woman and how consistently it was defined by a world I had invented in my head. I had decided somewhere along the line that blondes were the prize-ponies, that baring cleavage would undo the damage of uttering an intelligent comment, and that the only way to be noticed was to give in to a culture where the number of catcalls you received on DP was directly proportional to the amount of glitter with which you were able to coat your visible skin.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>What am I saying?

And that overall, culture is what you surround yourself with, and if you can find friends that don’t judge or force you into the slut/prude binary, that you might start to find the remedy to that shame we were all instilled with in high school.</p>\n<p><em>Lexi Cary is a second-year English and theater major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47028\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/year-takes-slutprude-binary-rebuttal-weeks-hump-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47028\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/year-takes-slutprude-binary-rebuttal-weeks-hump-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/year-takes-slutprude-binary-rebuttal-weeks-hump-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/year-takes-slutprude-binary-rebuttal-weeks-hump-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/year-takes-slutprude-binary-rebuttal-weeks-hump-2/","id":6008,"author":{"id":502,"name":"Lexi Cary"},"related":[6007,6006,6005],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prude to Crude: How One Freshman Found Her Inner Freak","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Until college, I was the prude.

At my ironically slutty all-girls Catholic school, everyone tried to hide their obvious skankiness. And while my boyfriend and I had been doing the dance with no pants all along, I didn’t want to tarnish the cute and innocent reputation I’d built up for so long. Back then, sex and all things related were taboo.</p>\n<p>Now fast forward to my first few months of college: Suddenly thrust into this new environment, I was a sheltered sponge ready to soak up all the new experiences I could get. With encouragement from my new friends and a developed taste for alcohol, I learned fast. This was a new me — the confident A, who will scope out a party and easily grab the hottest guy there by the end. Who wants to get tied down anyway? Why do we need conversations? What’s a first or last name?</p>\n<p>As we all know, hooking up in Santa Barbara is not frowned upon. It’s our way of having a good time and making new friends. One of the things I admire most about I.V. culture is that it understands the committment-free aspect of hook-ups. It really is a shame that the rest of the world won’t join in on this neighborhood orgy of sorts. And this is where my dilemma comes in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Over Spring Break, I met a boy from home who made me shiver by just looking into my eyes. He was so incredibly attractive that I had dirty thoughts in my head for days. My usual I.V.-approved reaction — “Hey, I think you’re cute, let’s make out!” — wasn’t going to work. I was out of my I.V. comfort zone and I panicked. At school, the cutie and I would easily end up in the nearest bedroom (or bathroom, closet, bush, etc.). At home, however, I felt myself wanting more than that sort of instant gratification. And while nothing more than friendship could come from our relationship because of the distance, the experience has really taught me a lesson about how much I have changed as a result of my first year in college.</p>\n<p>Before I came here, a friend told me that UCSB is like an adult Disneyland. There are amazing people who don’t judge or disapprove of your promiscuous, drunk endeavors. On DP, guys get wolf whistles and girls let their girls hang out. During the school year, my mind is in the zone — the lovin’ zone; I’m in the Santa Barbara state of mind. But when I go home, I need to convert my mind back to the standards of San Francisco life. I can’t just bring a new guy home every night. I can’t just make out with the hottest guy at the club (before getting his name, anyway).</p>\n<p>In just a few weeks, I again have to prepare myself for the oppressive place we call the real world. One day I want to be able to run around hugging and loving everyone. But alas, the rest of the world isn’t ready for our type of openness and understanding…aside from good ol’ Amsterdam, of course.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous is a first-year global and international studies major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/prude-crude-freshman-freak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/prude-crude-freshman-freak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/prude-crude-freshman-freak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/prude-crude-freshman-freak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/prude-crude-freshman-freak/","id":6007,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6006,6005,6004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"As Conservatives Try to Silence Young Voters, Students Fear A Growing Trend","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you pass through the Arbor on your way to or from class, you may have seen the signs: “Please Don’t Take My Vote, Mr. Pappas.” In 2008, Steve Pappas lost the election for County Supervisor to...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>If you pass through the Arbor on your way to or from class, you may have seen the signs: “Please Don’t Take My Vote, Mr. Pappas.”</p>\n<p>In 2008, Steve Pappas lost the election for County Supervisor to Doreen Farr and, dissatisfied with such an outcome, spent the next three years in court trying to get the votes of Isla Vista residents and UCSB students thrown out. These attempts did not suc- ceed, so Pappas is back for a second run. His audacity to come to our campus and try to buy our votes with ping-pong balls after trying to disenfranchise us is honestly laughable. The problem is, Pappas is not alone. Pappas’ attempt to do away the student vote is not an isolated, single incident. This is</p>\n<p>not one politician being upset over a loss. This is a trend. It’s nationwide and spreading like an epidemic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Currently, 38 states are considering new legislation that is masqueraded as attempts to prevent voter fraud. Almost all of this legislation is really an attempt to disenfran- chise minorities and students. Wisconsin recently passed a Republican-backed law that prohibits students from voting on campus with their university IDs. Students are now required to present government-issued IDs with a valid address and expiration date. Florida’s new law requires participants in voter registration to register in advance with the state, a debilitating blow to college drives.</p>\n<p>If these measures don’t seem scary, then consider the legislation New Hampshire’s Republicans attempted to push through last year. HB 176 would have prevented stu- dents from voting in their college towns unless they resided there prior to matriculation. Imagine having to drive home for several hours and then back on a Tuesday in order to vote. One of the avid backers of this bill, Republican Assembly Speaker William O’Brien, said in a speech that his reasoning behind supporting such a bill had to do with the fact that students are “foolish,” vote “as a liberal” and “vote their feelings.” This is like saying that if someone does not vote for a Republican, then they are foolish, and therefore they should not vote, without actually saying it. The slew of such anti-student legislation proposals in an election year is only more evidence that the conservatives are scared — scared that young people will vote and that young people will not vote for them.</p>\n<p>I am not telling you whom to vote for. But I do suggest that before casting a ballot on June 5 you think long and hard about what sort of politician you want in office, which politician will fight for your rights, and which politician will try to turn California into New Hampshire or Florida.</p>\n<p><em>Alexandra Lototsky is a third-year political science and Slavic languages and literatures major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/","id":6012,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6011,6010,6009],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University Faculty Members Respond to Nexus’ ‘Least Useful Majors’ Report","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"To the editors of the Daily Nexus: We would like to take a minute and respond to the May 9 article entitled “UCSB’s Least Useful Majors.” The title of this article, as well as its reliance on po...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>To the editors of the Daily Nexus:</p>\n<p>We would like to take a minute and respond to the May 9 article entitled “UCSB’s Least Useful Majors.” The title of this article, as well as its reliance on poorly researched data (drawn from a Newsweek Tumblr post), presents a skewed picture of the value of a liberal arts education today, despite the authors’ attempt to interview faculty and students affiliated with each department mentioned.</p>\n<p>The University of California system is well respected throughout the world for the quality of its humanities and fine arts programs — programs which offer degrees that are not, as your article implies, “useless,” but which provide students with a broad education leading to exciting careers not only in the arts fields, but also to careers in a spectrum of other fields. Large and small companies in all industries report that the qualities they look for most in new employees are creativity, problem-solving, collaboration and risk-taking.

Arts workers are twice as likely as other U.S. workers to have college degrees, a trend that may provide some advantage to artists in the U.S. economy, which increasingly requires workers to have at least some college-level education. Artist occupations with some of the highest projected growth rates, according to the study, are museum technicians and conservators (26 percent), curators (23 percent) and multimedia artists and animators (14 percent).</p>\n<p>UCSB recently participated in a national survey of college arts and humanities graduates (SNAAP, the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project), which measures the following:</p>\n<p>• satisfaction with curricular and extracurricular experiences</p>\n<p>• current and past education and employment</p>\n<p>• relevance of arts training to work and further education</p>\n<p>• types of art practiced and how often</p>\n<p>• support and resource needs following graduation</p>\n<p>• experiences as teachers</p>\n<p>• income and support, student debt and other financial issues</p>\n<p>According to SNAAP results, arts graduates experience relatively low rates of unemployment — only 6 percent — and people who work in the arts report some of the highest levels of job satisfaction among all occupations. The study also found that arts graduates gained employment quickly upon graduation, with 83 percent of graduates finding work within the first year of obtaining their degree, while another 12 percent went on to pursue additional higher education.</p>\n<p>Income levels in arts majors are also very competitive: the median annual income in 2010 for UC arts grads was $30,000 immediately upon graduation; $50,000 within 10 years of graduation, with that number steadily increasing as students moved away from their college years and into the mid-point of their careers. Students who had graduated with arts majors in the 1995 cohort reported a median household income of $100,000.</p>\n<p>We hope that by providing this information we can generate some real dialogue about the value of education at UCSB, and encourage you to explore the statistics and testimonies gathered in both the SNAAP survey and by the National Endowment for the Arts — all of which clearly belie the myth of the arts being “useless” at UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>– Ellen Anderson, Director, Isla Vista Arts</p>\n<p>– Professor Paul Berkowitz, Chair, Music Department, UCSB</p>\n<p>– Professor Ann Bermingham, Director, Interdisciplinary Humanities Center</p>\n<p>– Professor Laurie Monahan, Director, Arts Research Initiative, Department of History of Art and Architecture</p>\n<p>– Professor Jane Mulfinger, Chair, Art Department</p>\n<p>– Professor Marko Peljhan, co-Director, University of California Institute for Research in the Arts, Vice Chair Media Arts and Technology</p>\n<p>– Holly Unruh, Associate Director, UC Institute for Research in the Arts</p>\n<p>– Professor Cristina Venegas, Chair, Film and Media Studies</p>\n<p>– Professor Kim Yasuda, co-Director, University of California Institute for Research in the Arts, Department of Art</p>\n<p>– Emily Zinn, Associate Director, Interdisciplinary Humanities Center</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

While this may be standard protocol in places with low crime rates and little to no violence, it seems to me like an absurd waste of resources on the part of the IVPD. Every weekend, without fail, there are always stories, either officially reported or not, of instances of students being robbed, threatened or beaten by non-Isla Vista residents who oftentimes perpetrate these crimes in large groups.</p>\n<p>Why are these thieves, gang bangers and fight seekers roaming our streets looking for violence while 4-5 police officers are busy booking some sad-faced freshman for carrying a beer in his pocket or interrogating a girl who misstepped in her high heels? It seems that the focus of the IVPD is more towards the collection of lucrative alcohol-related crime tickets instead of preventing violence by outsiders or pursuing thieves and criminals.  Maybe the IVPD should focus its attention more on stopping our fellow Isla Vista residents from being stabbed to death or beaten on the ground by a group of gang members instead of drinking a little too much or urinating behind the wrong dumpster.</p>\n<p>The first step to preventing these crimes is enforcing strict measures on people who perpetrate violent crimes in Isla Vista.  Instead, the SB superior court handed down a ludicrous slap on the wrist to Benjamin Vargas, who stabbed a man 16 times until he died, following a verbal argument on Abrego, and received only a manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum of 11-year sentence. This means, all factors considered (parole, reduced sentence etc.), this man will be back on the streets of I.V. in a few short years and will have another opportunity to inflict violence on I.V. residents, who by then could be our younger siblings or even current underclassmen. Another similar incident occurred just a few months ago in February when a group of non-Isla Vista residents stabbed two people and continuously beat another student’s head against a curb on the 6600 block of DP; all three victims were hospitalized following the incident.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

In a world of willful ignorance and denial, scientific evidence and conclusions are often neglected or unreasonably disputed. Greater dissemination of scientific research is needed across all religious and political beliefs. Political groups in particular have an agenda, and scientific evidence is frequently dismissed in support of the group’s goals.</p>\n<p>To be sure, some of my most admired and appreciated science professors are likely theistic, while others are likely atheistic. I don’t know their beliefs for certain, because they are professional scientists and teachers foremost and they keep their personal beliefs private. Science does not need to rely solely on atheists as its champions. I know many exceptional scientists who are likely theistic — they synthesize their religious and scientific views, and they advocate careful, unbiased science.</p>\n<p>I truly hope that more people, irrespective of belief or political opinion, will continue to learn from science, advocate good science and yet remain healthily skeptical. Especially in politics, scientific evidence is often reduced to mere opinion, which is incredibly dangerous. This extreme polarization and ignorance span all political and religious spectra. Luckily, advocates and practitioners of good science also comprise a variety of religious and political beliefs. We just need more of them, along with a better-educated populace.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The spectacular physical feats that professional athletes perform on a regular basis in front of excited crowds in the arena and at home often justify this viewpoint.</p>\n<p>However, there are times when we are reminded, often suddenly and unexpectedly, that the superhuman perspective of athletes is really just an illusion — that they are really men and women made out of flesh and bone, like you or me. The suicide of San Diego Chargers’ legend Junior Seau is one of these times.</p>\n<p>While star athletes possess incredible size, lightning speed and Herculean strength, the mental makeup of athletes reflects the mental makeup of society. Sure, there are strategic geniuses who seem to think plays ahead of their competition and workhorses with the resolve to overcome any obstacle life puts in their path. But there are also fragile minds. There are some who suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, impulse control disorders, schizophrenia and sleep disorders. These mental health issues are often rooted in the same things that cause mental disorders in non-athlete populations: individual genetics and the social environment they matured in. However, they are exacerbated by the stress of high expectations and intense scrutiny that top-tier athletes face, as well as the physical strains and tolls on their body.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the case of Seau, along with seven other members of the 1994 Chargers AFC Championship team who died before age 45, we often only see the end result of the mental issues. Things like excess substance abuse or gambling, extreme violent behavior or self-destructive habits, like self-harming or overeating, are often the only means that athletes use to treat their emotional distress. Even athletes who don’t lose control of their base impulses or seek an external source of comfort like drugs or food often have health issues related to concussions, or life and relationship issues caused by depression.</p>\n<p>So what’s a player to do? There’s no easy answer, but I wonder if that is truly the right question. If physical health rather than mental health were an issue for athletes, I’m sure powerful organizations like the NFL would do anything in their power to help ensure that the athletes have long and productive careers. But because the issues are less visible, and often only present themselves externally after their careers are over, that isn’t the case.</p>\n<p>The stigma against acknowledging mental health issues is still an issue and the casualties are beginning to pile up. Junior Seau and Dave Duerson (a key starter on the legendary ’85 Bears Super Bowl-winning defense) are just two of the most recent veterans to commit suicide, and the NFL has yet to provide substantial mental health services to veterans and active players. If this trend doesn’t change, not only will we see a continuance of the type of off-the-field issues that traditionally plague sports stars (associations with drugs or trouble with the law), but we’ll continue to see stars take their own lives. As a sports fan who follows athletes throughout their college and professional careers, it will grow harder for me to watch players I saw mature end their lives because of unaddressed mental health issues.</p>\n<p>My thoughts and condolences go out to the Seau family and all other people that fight unseen battles. I hope the cavalry is coming soon.</p>\n<p>David Washington is a second-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46745\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/seaus-suicide-sheds-light-necessity-mental-physical-wellbeing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46745\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/seaus-suicide-sheds-light-necessity-mental-physical-wellbeing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/seaus-suicide-sheds-light-necessity-mental-physical-wellbeing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/seaus-suicide-sheds-light-necessity-mental-physical-wellbeing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/seaus-suicide-sheds-light-necessity-mental-physical-wellbeing/","id":6006,"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington"},"related":[6005,6004,6003],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":13,"route":"/categories/opinion/letters-to-the-editor","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
