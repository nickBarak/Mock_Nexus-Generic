It shows in the patriarchal culture the department embodies and perpetuates. It shows in the bankrupt values and ideologies the department institutionalizes and advocates. It shows in the department’s silencing and absencing of anything and anyone who questions or challenges its faulty and racist foundations and structure. It shows in the department’s legacy and habit of narrow white ways of knowing, thinking, acting and being. This is so apparent to us, because we have lived it. We have been laughed at for raising questions of difference. We have been told by you we do not belong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It thus is not so surprising to us that your hollow letter of concern to the geography community glosses over the death of George Floyd in such passing as to be completely tone deaf, at best, and purposely dog-whistling at worst. Floyd’s murder is not even the intention or attention of your sentence or concern. You say, “We realize these are indeed troubling times on many fronts,” and you associate what is troubling with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">events that</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his killing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be amusing to note, if not for the direness of this reality you contribute to, that your reference to the vile and unjust public execution of Floyd is myopically entangled within your seemingly indelible white privilege: how faculty must “grapple” with having to work from home. Is that really the reach of your concern? Is that really the best that you can do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, it is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">event of Floyd’s murder</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> deserves explicit recognition, direct condemnation and corrective actions. As do the murders of Breonna Taylor, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Stephon Clark and so many other Black people at the hands of those who are supposedly there to serve and protect. Does this trouble you? Or, do the “many fronts” of concern you mention express the vocal and visible challenges now being presented to the white hegemony the department has for so long promulgated and promoted? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. You and every chair of the department before you have, on several occasions, presided over a faculty that has turned down exceptional Black and Brown hires, including an African-American woman, a woman of African origin and a Nepalese woman, only to hire more white faculty. You and every chair before you have embodied a department that has done nothing to level the playing field with your privilege. The word “diversity” is spoken at faculty meetings as a token nod to progressive values, but you do nothing to make the department more welcoming to and inclusive of non-white students and potential Black, Brown and Indigenous faculty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what we DON’T need: more diversity seminars, webinars, colloquiums and forums that you can check off your to-do list. We DON’T need Black and Brown students and faculty to shoulder the burden of changing a system that claims “freedom of thought” but ends up keeping that platform for white voices, values and modes of geographical thought, methodologies, scholarship and activism.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a discipline that literally has the world as its focus, your myopic views and behaviors are an embarrassment and a failure. You uphold the racist and colonial legacy of geography by not confronting this very real history of the discipline, and you advocate and perpetuate these racist and colonial tendencies today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this truly brings you discomfort, if there is a modicum of sincerity in your message, you may then be asking: what CAN I do? The answer is: begin to change the entire structure of your department from within to work for corrective justice inside and outside your halls of privilege. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start teaching about the racist and colonial history of the very discipline you purport to represent. Step outside your comfort zones of white privilege and incorporate into all classes geographical issues of race and racism, privilege and marginalization, gender and identity, and resource destruction and exploitation. Actively recruit Black scholars and other scholars of color. Actively work with, take direction from, and cite and publish with Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. Actively examine the biases in your own work, in your own choices, and in your own institutions and power structures. And explicitly recognize and vocalize that electing a faculty of color as chair is far overdue. Actively work to change and correct this. And for the sake of all and any gods, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educate yourself</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And if there is any grain of sincerity in the department’s message, all of these steps must begin to be taken </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOW</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Recalling the words of Dr. King:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that       over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yes, these are indeed troubling times. Especially when your thoughts, given in abstract sympathy and for dubious ends, only serve to re-traumatize and build dams against a student body that has faced discrimination from your department since day one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your brief, ambiguous message presents and represents the full extent that this department is willing to go to in order to acknowledge what is happening outside the ivory tower, and we mean </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivory</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the only purpose it serves is to give comfort and satisfaction to those already enjoying the white privilege and power that tower provides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your next actions are as a chair and as a department — and make no mistake, silence and upholding the white status quo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is action </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— will be revealing of the sincerity or insincerity of your message to us, marginalized members of the UCSB geography community. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G</span><span style=\"font-weight:

We can hardly remember what it was like before the debut of the iPhone in 2007 — just 13 years ago. Twitter was founded 14 years ago, and now one of the most influential people on the planet, the President of the United States, sometimes sends out “information” over 100 times a day through the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of these technological advances, university life hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years — we still go to a lecture hall with over 200 people, professors still use chalkboards with chalk dust everywhere, and while we may have GauchoSpace and Umail, most students still prefer hand-written homework. There’s something irreplaceable about this aspect of learning. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, everything changed due to COVID-19. I have spent 95% of my time during the past two and a half months indoors in my apartment in Isla Vista. COVID-19 has forced an evolution to remote learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote learning is efficient, or at least it was intended to be. The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time. It is meant to be a direct connection to knowledge and professors. Yet my experience is that there are a lot more factors to take into account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, not going to school breaks the psychological state of studying. Rolling out of bed and opening my 32-inch display screen, which I also use to watch YouTube and play games, doesn’t make me feel like studying. I try my best to avoid using my laptop for leisure during the day, but it’s unavoidable. It requires much persistence to stay focused. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare this to sitting in a classroom, which is quiet and has hundreds of people around you studying. Even if you drift away for a bit, you usually come right back to focus because it “feels” like the right thing to do. As far as efficiency is concerned, while cutting back some inefficient activities, remote learning also introduces new ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, because it is more or less a forced change, a lot of details have not been figured out. For example, many lecturers are not used to writing on a tablet and screen recording, so now, they make videos talking over prepared slides. As a result, students can no longer see the steps of derivation, and they lose their natural signs and annotation in graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is with homework grading. The process usually involves students handing homework into a collection box before a deadline; then, the TA would collect them and distribute them to graders. Now, many classes use the GauchoSpace built-in function, which is, to put it mildly, bad for anything that requires stepped grading and commentary. Luckily, some commercial solutions exist, and many classes in S.T.E.M. subjects are utilizing them. It is impressive to see classes quickly learning to use these new tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think COVID-19 has forced innovation and exploration on the individual level, and remote learning will be a good thing in the long run. We are prepared to find a new way of living and learning with more resilience.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Jerry Ling</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitherto, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has already</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surpassed 2 million in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which represents </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over a quarter of the known cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. As the most powerful country with access to some of the best medical care and most advanced technologies, it is worth considering why there are a rising number of cases in the U.S. because this pandemic affects not only the overall economy of the nation, but also every one of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate that UCSB had changed its teaching mode to online before the coronavirus was widely spread. With this opportunity, I have returned to my home country, where the situation is mostly under control. Thanks to my professors, I do not have to stay up late to participate in live meetings because of my current time zone. In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been successful in keeping our classes up and running by leveraging our technology. Besides some of the negative experiences that remote learning may bring us, I think that it can also benefit us in many ways. For example, students save time they would normally spend commuting, therefore freeing up more time for focusing on their studies. They are also able to watch the recorded lectures repeatedly to strengthen any points in their classes they do not understand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we have had to abandon face-to-face conversations, I think this is an acceptable change. Nothing is more important than our collective safety. Turning to the discussion on online examinations, I do want to stress that teachers should be more flexible and considerate with students. We are all uneasy because of the current circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From my point of view, remote lecturing has been quite successful at UCSB. However, I am suspicious about the assertion that students can return to the campus in September. Although I have complete faith in UCSB’s resilience, I believe it is too early to make decisions. The situation seems to be persistent and since this type of lecturing is working, I think we should continue to learn online in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Robert Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid problems like Internet connectivity and time zone differences, I chose to remain in Santa Barbara during this period of remote learning. I was pretty optimistic about the epidemic at the time, and I thought that the situation would surely improve before summer vacation. So, I rented a house with my friend in Goleta and was ready to get used to this new learning method. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, spring quarter did not proceed as successfully as I anticipated. As a pre-chem student, I had to take two labs this quarter. It was very inconvenient to conduct both of the lab courses in an online format. Students had no access to manipulate data and make measurements by ourselves. Although TAs would record experiment videos for us, the experiments were not conducted by our own hands, and there were always some problems that we could not understand. We had to repeatedly stop and ask questions when finishing our lab reports, which was time-consuming. In addition, the lab manuals were partly revised because of the online learning. In one class, we needed to spend an extra two to three hours to complete each lab report. It seemed we did not truly grasp the knowledge we needed to learn in labs, and we wasted a lot of time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see some positive results from online learning. Many of my courses were recorded. This meant that I could choose when to study according to my habits. I did not have to get up early to catch the bus to campus and have to feel tired. I obtained a lot more sleep than I usually have and was more energetic when studying. In this way, online learning was helpful; however, I found I was not disciplined at home without a structured campus schedule. It was hard to be persistent with online learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 virus outbreak turned out to be much worse than I expected. I hope that our in-person interactions will return as soon as possible. My roommate got a flight to return home two weeks ago, so I am the only one left in the house. The air tickets are very expensive and difficult to purchase now. I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p>\n<p>– <em>Candace Chen</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-95010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-95010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/","id":5709,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5708,5707,5706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: The Nexus Needs to Commit to Formal Diversity Initiatives","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Outgoing editor Sanya Kamidi outlines formal diversity initiatives that the Nexus must put in place.

Although I knew what I was getting myself into when I announced my candidacy for EVPLA in yet another Associated Students election this past week, I did not expect the drama to get this toxic, or this personal. My brother attempted to make light of the situation: “Now you know what it’s like to have #haters,” he joked. But I couldn’t keep myself from refreshing the page, reading over and over again the dehumanizing words about my identity and experiences, looking through the profiles of the strangers who seemed to know me without ever trying. As I read lies and rumors about myself and my peers, the numbing ache in my stomach grew, but I was unable to tear my eyes away. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not like I’ve never received any sort of backlash before.

My parents and most of my family, like thousands of others, left Iran for fear of being persecuted as part of a Jewish minority when the Islamic regime violently came to power.

Yet in my experience, we are often harassed, bullied and excluded from progressive spaces on campus for our beliefs. The author of the tweet does not know me and yet felt like it was appropriate to erase and dismiss every single thing about me. In their eyes, nothing — not my years of dedication to progressive causes, my personal experiences or struggles or any of the work I have done on this campus — none of that is valid because of their preconceived notions of who I am. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it’s the anonymous comments; or that at last year’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divestment resolution hearing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a former A.S.

I am not afraid to speak my truth about issues that are important to me, and I am putting myself out there to run this campaign. I knew that displaying vulnerability would open the door for attacks on my character. However, the rest of my community, those who do not run for office or are hesitant to express themselves and those who just simply want to be accepted members of the student body, are just as affected by incidents like this. They witness this rhetoric and are made to feel fearful of their peers. Which is exactly the objective: People like this want us to be scared. They want to silence us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, it’s increasingly easy to pick a side hyper-fast and stick to it. To reference a saying I heard recently, conversation has become either meaningless or impossible. We embolden ourselves within the comfort of our self-constructed echo chambers, “cancelling” anyone or anything that would make us question our ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my peers in A.S.: Why do you think the student body is fed up with us? When Senate meetings run for hours, Daily Nexus articles are flooded with anonymous comments full of slurs and baseless accusations and social media feeds are cluttered with ruthless campaigning and (not-so) subtle jabs at competitors, their faith in our ability to serve them dwindles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve turned into a reality show. At best, we’re the laughing stock of this campus; at worst, a waste of student fees. And when it comes to supporting our friends when it’s their turn to take the stage, we tear each other down. When elections come around, some of the most vocal people in our organization, who promise to uplift marginalized communities and uphold progressive values, are the ones who engage in this harmful behavior, stripping people of their complexities in their attempt to make them fit into their binary definitions of “good” or “bad.” Instead of fairly criticizing platform points and ideals, this has become a competition of whose identity is the most valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we expend so much energy fighting each other, we distract and become distracted from the fights that really matter — our graduate students are calling on us to support them, our balconies are collapsing while our landlords stay silent and the lawsuits against our UCPD are still stalled. Where is our solidarity?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are these the hands we want to leave the fate of our campus in? Will these be the people to create tangible change at UCSB, or will A.S. revert to its divisive, unproductive ways? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB student body: You each pay over $600 to Associated Students.

We won’t be going to Davidson Library, Campbell Hall or the Rec Cen anymore. We might not even be walking at our commencement ceremony in front of all our friends and family. All of those promises we held out for until our last year, the bucket list items that we promised our freshman-year selves to complete by the end of senior year, will now go unfulfilled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting here in self-quarantine, I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and reminisce. At first, I was angry: angry at myself, my housemates, the university, the government, you name it. Then I just felt sad. I thought about all the goodbyes I didn’t get to say, all the faces I might not ever see again, all the places I may never get to bike to. But after riding out this rollercoaster of emotions, I think back on my years at UCSB and I am so, so, so happy. There is no other university where I would have wanted to spend my three years and seven months at, no other people that I would have wanted to share my college memories with, and there is simply nowhere like Isla Vista, no other place I would’ve wanted to live in. My college experience showed me how to love myself and others, that work and play can coexist and that strangers can become friends overnight. If it weren’t for UCSB and the people that I met along the way, I wouldn’t be the person who I am today. For that, I am forever grateful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2021 and the classes to come, take this as an opportunity to reflect on your college experience. Fulfill the promises that you made to yourself sooner than later. Don’t hesitate to introduce yourself to that stranger in your class you always make eye contact with. Don’t opt for nights in bed instead of nights spent with your friends. Don’t leave your bucket list untouched until the last quarter and, most definitely, do not convince yourself that winter quarter has to be boring. Don’t leave it all until the end because you never know if that opportunity will be taken from you. Life is precious, yet unrelenting, so cherish it always.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the Class of 2020, I am saddened by the way that our time at UCSB has come to an end, but I am even more saddened by the global pandemic that has taken away people’s lives and livelihoods. This pandemic will go on to affect more than just our college careers; it will affect people for years to come. As a collective group, it is important for us to understand that we have the power to help alleviate this crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us are fortunate that we have UCSB, family and friends as our support systems because many people going through this do not. We are fortunate that we had three years and seven months to build a strong support system that we can lean on during this difficult and hectic time. Let’s use this opportunity to stay aware, educated and informed and to act with compassion, patience and love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending love from my quarantined room to yours,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Fukui<br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class of 2020</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/to-the-class-of-2020/","id":5715,"author":{"id":812,"name":"Christine Fukui"},"related":[5714,5713,5712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Remembering JJ Sanani","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-03-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Friends of Intare \"JJ\" Sanani remember the late fourth-year and recall many pieces of wisdom he passed along during his life.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth of JJ’s life was obvious. The smile on his face meant what you thought it did, and the concern behind his voice was always genuine. JJ’s life at UCSB was filled with adventure because he knew the value of a life, before his closest friends had to realize it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We lost JJ Sanani on the night of Dec. 13, 2019 — at the end of finals week in fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He smoked Lucky Strikes (no filter) and drank Natty Daddy. He would rock a fit with sandals, too-short running shorts, a colorful shirt, a thick tan overcoat and some shades. When you told him something </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shocking</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he always furrowed his brows and made a concerned face. He grew his hair out all year, and they were long enough where we called them </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worms</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He was taller than everyone, and so he was able to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put his arm around you and he always pulled you closer. He would drop his head down to your level and say, “Listen…” before saying his words after you finished your story. He was a people person. He had love for everyone — himself, his closest friends and the friends that pissed him off most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there was an article written about JJ that did not mention the partying, the author did not know him. In a large crowd, JJ would always be caught with the biggest smile and unmatched excitement. Combining his hair, clothes and height, he was always the first one to be spotted in a crowd and he embraced all of that love. Believe me when I say that JJ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> danced. And since he was so tall, so were his limbs, making him a bit lanky. Nevertheless, the man was able to move his hips (and we all knew it). I, and many others, are thankful that he provided an avenue to enjoy so many rowdy nights out. There is a video I have on my phone where JJ is on the roof wobblin’ so hard you couldn’t miss him. He stayed in his prime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ would never answer his phone when people </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needed to find him. Yes, it was difficult to get a hold of him, but once he locked his eyes on you — he didn’t let you go. JJ has pushed through crowds of people to put his arm around his special people and ask, genuinely, how they are. In those moments, his love showed so much that it melted everything else around him. Only you existed for a few minutes. He was down for the people, the thrill, the memories, all in an effort to battle the fleeting time of college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about living in the moment — the man constantly lost his phone. And his wallet. There were times where we talked about it and he told me that he kinda liked not having his phone because he would avoid distractions. The only way he could tell the time was by listening to the bells of Storke Tower. He was proud of living in the now, without any extra worries. Not only did he survive, but he thrived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For sure, you notice his clothes and his hair, but his smile was beyond words, and you only ever saw it at its fullest. JJ’s truth lived on through his laugh. It’s easy to say that everything could be a joke to JJ, and his infamous chuckle is something that I hope my ears never unhear. He was also able to make you feel like he was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> listening to you. He asked all of the right questions, in the middle of it all. He knew how to console all of his friends, and he was appreciated for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did he listen loudly, but he made sure </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knew he loved us. He made sure to tell me on many occasions how much he loved and trusted me. It helps me to know that so many in Isla Vista got the same kind of treatment. He took the time to have those one-on-one conversations whenever it was needed. I am taking the time, now, to recognize that. I have a vivid memory of standing on his balcony during summer session where he told me something like, “You don’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it Gilbert, I seriously </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seriously</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trust you — and you’re one of the only people I can say I’ve trusted with my life since day one. I don’t think you’ll </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get it dude, you are a special guy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The only person I was glad to have laugh at my problems. In the end, he was always able to bring it back to how tiny we are compared to the universe, and why that means we should just make the most of our life in motion. JJ was a reminder to not let it pass by you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was also known for being very vocal about his values and was not easily persuaded. From topics on religion, politics, education, social life and ethics, we’ve had all of those debates in my old bedroom. The point is that though JJ never really came out on top of those debates; he was humble enough to ask more about it and to concede when it was appropriate. To be able to admit fault and to adapt is rare. During freshman year, he would always get in arguments with our friend Daniel, and I had to come up with a safe word: “dolphins.” Look, a safe word for bickering sounds ridiculous, but it worked. Every. Single. Time. He stayed humble. All of this to say that JJ still fought to the end, with his teeth and his knees. His passion is what we all remember. Those values that he held closest to him, he never let go. He knew what it meant to respect and appreciate those he cared about and stood up against unfairness. It was hard to make him sit down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, JJ was known for being kind and loving. It was a unique love because it was so widespread. I don’t need to mention all of the times I’ve been stopped while we were walking together because everyone wants to say hello. His genuine words with individuals, his spirit filled with fire and his humble admiration for his friends around him is what he leaves for the rest of us. The irony is that my first memories with JJ are about discussing all the adventures that UCSB had to offer us, but JJ did not know that he would end up </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the community itself. JJ’s impact on Isla Vista was larger than he could even imagine, and he would be damn happy to know that he touched so many people.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93502\" style=\"width: 193px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93502\" data-attachment-id=\"93502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-sanani-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=720%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"JJ Sanani 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?fit=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93502\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2-141x250.jpg?resize=183%2C324\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JJ-Sanani-2.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Section II:</i> A Mosaic – Accounts by those closest</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandon Hanan </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with JJ, he always took a genuine interest in my life and my problems. He always had this profound wisdom he would share with me to uplift my spirits and he knew the right times I needed to hear it. I remember a time back in high school when I was going through a bit of a slump in my life and JJ and I were together hanging out in the backyard of my old house when he expressed to me, “Brandon, you do know that you’re my brother and one of the most unique and charismatic individuals that I have ever met in my life, right? I mean, that’s why so many people love you.”  That statement hit me so hard I remember it to this day and it changed my whole perspective of who I am as a person. He just knew what to say and when to say it. No one else could give me those types of inspirational pep talks like JJ did because no one really knew me like he did. His uniqueness, selflessness, wisdom and authenticity amazed me throughout our friendship. He also had a catchphrase he would always say to me that described his life so perfectly, which was “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c’est la vie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meaning, “that’s life.” JJ always lived life to the fullest, fearless of risks and valued human connection with every single person he came in contact with. I would be a bit nervous about JJ organizing my bachelor party, but I used to always tell him that he was going to be the best man at my wedding. I knew regardless that he is my best man and will always be in my heart. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not about having anxiety for the future or regret from the past. It’s about living fully, like JJ did, in the present moment in our lives.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kasimir Tan</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon first impression, JJ was notable for his good looks, his sense for cynical — yet truthful —humor, his nice smile and his unquestionably good sense of style. But one way that he really stood out in our community of Isla Vista was in his listening skills.  In our modern day of technology and distractions, you will rarely come across a person who had the listening skills that JJ had. I always really enjoyed talking to him because a conversation with him was always rich. He was generally interested in what the people around him thought regarding deep subjects, such as the state of the world, science, religion and theology.  Whether he knew you for days or years, he could engage with almost anyone at any time and make them feel that he was truly thinking about their words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really appreciated this quality of his when I was his roommate. Over the nine months that I lived with him, we got into some quarrels as roommates often do.  Though at some points we wanted to bite each other’s heads off, we almost always could come to some conclusion and better understanding of one another that would help us resolve our issues.  I think we both realized that oftentimes the anger we expressed at one another had sources that were external to our relationship, and that through discussing our issues, we understood each other better and the anger dissolved.  One profound way in which he expressed his understanding was when I would call him out on his bullshit. After explaining to him why I thought his behavior was immoral or why it was bothering me, sometimes he would say, “You’re right, I’ll do better next time.”  I’ve never met anyone who could admit fault like he could and who had the humility to tell someone else they were right when he realized they saw he was wrong. As I got to know him more and more, I really felt that he was one of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">truest</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends I had in my time at UCSB.  Though it didn’t always seem like it through his flaws,  I came to realize that he genuinely cared for all the people that were a part of his life, and he showed that he cared through how he spoke and listened to people.  I really liked that he had this quality, which is so rare these days. When I think of him, I miss the pleasant and unpleasant conversations we used to have. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Put down your phone to listen to what the people physically around you say, and try to understand where they are coming from. This is a positive quality that will help you make others feel special in our modern world.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilbert Nazari </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met JJ on the first day that we moved into Anacapa Hall, and it has been an adventure and friendship I could never expect. Coming to terms with such a loss, I can at least grab onto those moments where he told me, “I trust you more than anyone else out here.” He was able to share those moments of truth when I didn’t know I needed them. I will never forget how intensely JJ would introduce me to the people that were around him. Since I missed a year of college, I was always behind with meeting so many mutual friends, but JJ never stopped introducing me with fire in his words. He would tell people “I love this guy more than anyone!” or “You don’t know how lucky you are to meet Gilbert.” The passion in those introductions is something I’ll never forget. He’d wrap his long arms around my neck just to share me with his friends — making connections. Even his own backyard party where there were too many heads to count, when he saw my face in the crowd, he went after me. And he stayed so passionate about speaking beauty of his friends that I can’t forget it myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you love someone enough, you let them know. And when you introduce them to the friends you love, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduce them like your life depends on it.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isa Guilfoyle</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, I’d run into JJ and, no matter how much time had passed, or what he had going on, he made me feel important and cared for. I think the thing he would tell me the most was just to relax, that I worried too much about everything. JJ taught me so much about how to enjoy life even when everything seems to be going wrong, because JJ knew that life was a gift and he wasn’t going to waste it. Even though we grew apart as life got in the way and sometimes weeks would go by without us seeing each other, every time we did, it went the same way. He’d show his big, toothy smile and shake his head, looking up to the sky with that carefree laugh, then he’d scoop me up in his arms and hug me tight enough so I could smell the stog he was probably smoking a few minutes before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time during our sophomore year, we ran into each other like this and JJ seemed especially excited. He started telling me about a class that he knew I would absolutely love because the majority of the work was done playing at recess with elementary schoolers. JJ and I would dream about being pediatricians together our freshman year of college. He reminded me of this and had me convinced. I remember the first time I went to a recess with him. To this day, I have never seen kids </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excited to play with someone. Within a few seconds, the kindergarteners had climbed up and all over him. He had kids hanging from his arms, holding onto his legs, climbing onto his front and back and a few ran circles around him. He just looked at me and smiled so big. JJ was completely content; he loved these kids just as much as they loved him. The sight of a JJ jungle gym was so funny, and such a pure representation of who JJ was. </span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Take care of those that you love and always let them know. JJ would carry you until his back broke and smile about it. He would make you laugh until you cried, or stop crying because you were laughing too hard. He’d call you out when you needed it but knew how to distract you. He was a true friend beyond space and time, and he will be forever missed. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Harano</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ and I had many great memories which I will cherish for the rest of my life. I will always miss that amazing sense of humor, his inquisitive mind, his wonderful outlook on the world and the people he shared it with. Through the way he lived, he taught us all so much about how important it is to have a positive attitude and how that positivity can encourage those around you. The most important thing I learned from JJ, however, did not come from one of those great moments I was able to share with him. Instead, it came after one of the worst arguments I’ve had with a close friend. JJ was always incredibly sensitive to the feelings of others and was deeply in tune with his own feelings. That being said, one time he and I had a horrible argument where we hurt each other’s feelings and said some terribly damaging things to one another. However, in an act that was truly reflective of his character, JJ came into my room the next morning and told me that he was still deeply upset with what was said between us but more importantly, he said that he genuinely cherished our friendship and that our relationship meant more to him than anything that happened the night before while letting me know he still loved me deeply. JJ always sought to make things alright with everyone and was willing to put his friends above himself in all cases. He displayed an emotional maturity and deep level of caring for those around him that is simply invaluable and somewhat rare for people our age. No matter the instance, he sought to be the best person he could be and made a genuine effort to bring light and happiness to those around them. He never shied away from being the bigger person in order to preserve what he cared about more than anything else — his friendships and relationships with those he loved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> JJ taught us to love deeply and to do everything you do with your entire heart, to be genuine with those around you and most importantly, to never let anything get in the way of spending time with those you love. It is because of this beautiful legacy that JJ will reign forever in our minds and our hearts. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nick Lombardi</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been 89 days and from time to time, I still forget that you are gone. When I watch the sunset and remember the raw conversations we had, I think of you. When I see someone trying so hard to become a better version of themself than they were the day before, I think of you</span><b>. When I see someone who is hurting but tries to run from their pain by loving others harder, I think of you</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The expression we had for you was “tell me you love me.” This quote was so perfectly representative of who you were: an expression that showed your vulnerability, but also your strength. You weren’t afraid of talking about topics like love with me. You showed me the importance of not being afraid to share your true emotions with both those you love and those you had just met. By doing this, you were able to create a bond that was individually special, raw and unique to each person you talked to. You had a way of pushing my buttons just hard enough to see how deep I could go. You weren’t afraid of seeing my pain, but instead, you would often seek it out just so you could show me that I wasn’t alone through it. You pushed me through stuff I didn’t want to deal with because you truly cared about me. Finally, JJ, you taught me how to love unconditionally, through all of the darkness. You are forever in my heart.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you I loved you enough when I could have. When I see you up there, you won’t have to ever say our quote again. Until then, with my whole heart, I love you buddy. Rest easy, brother.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live By:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don’t be afraid to smile in the face of your own vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Josh Lewczyk</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JJ was the first person that I met at UCSB and living with him in the dorms our first year was an experience I’ll never forget. Going into college, I knew that JJ and our other roommate, Jack, had been good friends since high school. I was definitely worried that I would be the odd man out, but JJ put that fear to rest on the first day that I met him. Talking to JJ was always so easy, even if the subject matter got serious, and he quickly became my closest friend at UCSB. I started freshman year as an introvert, but JJ helped me get out of my comfort zone and I met most of my close friends through him. I remember my favorite moments with him were late at night when we would sit by the lagoon and just talk about all the crazy stuff happening to us. There was this spot that we would chill at almost every night that looked right over the water. We were there after my first breakup and after my first failed college class, and he was always so quick to remind me of all the good stuff happening in our lives. He was just such an easygoing person that it was hard to stay upset around him. JJ was a true friend and he helped me get through some of the toughest moments of my life. I honestly don’t know what I would have done without him.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we are going through right now is only temporary and in no way defines us.  We are in one of the most beautiful places in the world right now, with some beautiful people — let’s make the most of it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daniel Gitlin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and most important thing you need to understand about my relationship with JJ is that we never agreed. Not on a single issue. But, for some reason, that strengthened our relationship more than any commonality could ever have. We were diametrically opposed and yet, two sides of the same coin; fundamentally, I think, we were somehow the same person, striving for the same goals, haunted by the same fears, but manifested in two wildly different personalities. That’s why JJ was my best friend, because no one understood me, or people, better than him. No one could wrap you around his finger, or build you up from dark places, like JJ. No matter how angry we might have been at each other, no matter how frustrated and high-strung from balancing our S.T.E.M. education with daily degeneracy, JJ and I always bonded through debates about art, religion, philosophy, our lives, marriage and the meaning of happiness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of my memories about JJ from our sophomore year revolve around our room. We had the deepest — and often most heated — talks of our relationship in that room, amongst mountains of his unending laundry and a littering of my various foodstuffs. Seated on a cigarette-stained futon with our feet propped on a posh leather footrest stolen from God-knows-where, our hopelessly broken windows streaming in afternoon light and the ocean breeze, we poured our hearts out. I specifically remember one of those afternoons: The conversation was more or less a rerun of talks we’d had before, until one of us decided to play music on our “shared” bar speaker. It evolved into an arrangement of our favorite songs, a wispy reflection of our lives as LA-born, beach-town college kids. A dash of Frank Ocean, some of JJ’s favorite Bob Marley, RHCP and then, for the climax, the bittersweet beauty of “Hotel California” by the Eagles. As we mouthed the lyrics and air-strummed Joe Walsh’s power chords, it became a song that so perfectly captured the crescendo of our lives.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entranced by an ephemeral dream, drawn in by a beautiful woman, and ensnared in a seemingly ceaseless cycle of partying, remorse, abstinence and partying.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We imagined this world we’d built as a tautology, a prison. But the kind of prison that life would be meaningless without. Every time I think of JJ, I think of him as the patron saint of the Hotel California, something like flame incarnate: so bright and frenetic and hopelessly confined, yet, somehow, so unabashedly free.</span></p>\n<p><b>Words to Live by: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love life, and all of life’s people, in the most essential form. In spite of our tendency to love conditionally — because of our goals, purpose, good luck or motives — JJ knew, more than anyone I ever met, why we need to love life and people </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unconditionally</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — for their intrinsic and ungraspable beauty.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93505\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93505\" data-attachment-id=\"93505\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93505\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3-250x167.jpg?resize=365%2C244\" alt=\"\" width=\"365\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-3.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93505\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Section III:</i> Isla Vista Memorial by Nick Lombardi</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memorial we had for you brought out over 400 people that you left an impact on in your three-and-a-half years here at UCSB. We shared stories, we shared laughs and we shared tears just remembering the love you brought to each of us individually. Thank you for that opportunity. Thank you for your beautiful gift of bringing entire communities together through your love. You helped teach me what community truly is. You helped teach us that we are not alone in our struggles. You helped teach us what being there for one another really means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really difficult planning the memorial for JJ. It did not require a massive amount of work but given the situation, it was the only thing on my mind for those three weeks leading up to it. There was so much support from the community, all just wanting to contribute and honor the man we miss so much. I set up a Facebook event page and helped decide exactly what we wanted to do for him. I had no clue what a memorial should look like or what we were even going to do at first, but as I kept thinking about it, I realized the message behind it was the community unity and support for each other.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93503\" style=\"width: 393px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93503\" data-attachment-id=\"93503\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93503\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2-250x167.jpg?resize=383%2C256\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because he passed away right as school was out, most people heard about the news when they were alone or with family. I was so thankful to have been with my father at the time, but what I needed and was missing was to be with my housemates and those who knew him. That month was agonizing, knowing that so many of us had to get through this loss without the support of one another right there. By the time of the memorial, I feel like it was difficult for a lot of people to reopen the wound. Within literal minutes of when we asked people to show up at our house, the entire house was shoulder-to-shoulder packed with JJ’s loved ones. From the house, we walked down the street with each person carrying a lit candle. It was something I will never forget. 400 strong, we were able to show the support we had for one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memorial was for JJ, but in a way, it was more a way to show that we, as a community, had each other to lean back on. To cry and to just love one another. To show each other that this was not something anyone should get through by themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we arrived at the bluffs overlooking Devereux Point, I told the group that this was a time to just be unified together. A friend of JJ’s named Peyton and I set up blankets prior to the group arriving. Whether people wanted to share funny stories or the way he impacted their lives, they were free to do so. However, I told them that if they just wanted to sit there in silence and just grieve with one another, that was so okay also. Some people spoke, but some of it was silence and an overwhelming feeling of love. We cried and just held onto one another.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93504\" style=\"width: 354px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93504\" data-attachment-id=\"93504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/jj-memorial/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jj memorial\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93504\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial-250x167.jpg?resize=344%2C230\" alt=\"\" width=\"344\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jj-memorial.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93504\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Gilbert Nazari</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the front, I got a slab of plywood that I painted white.

Planning this was something I felt I had an obligation to do well; however, I was not the reason it was so impactful. It was the collection of people who showed up and faced this pain head-on that made it so beautiful. It would have been easier to not think about and not face, but that is not what this community did. I am so proud to say that this is the community JJ surrounded himself with. A community that was there for him in the hardest of times. To all that were there, I am so thankful that you loved him well. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/letter-to-the-editor-remembering-jj-sanani/","id":5714,"author":{"id":805,"name":"The Opinions Staff"},"related":[5713,5712,5711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Public Thank-You Note to Bruce Porter","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/larger-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/larger-logo.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Josh Kenchel pens an open letter to County Supervisor candidate Bruce Porter.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear Bruce Porter,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted to take the chance to publicly thank you for your generosity.

Not long ago, she was simply perceived as an international college student. Now she is labeled a Chinese student from Wuhan –– the origin of the disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The imperceptible potential of contracting</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus, as well as the rate of propagation, are disturbing. Because the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virus can have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\">an incubation period</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\"> of up to 14 days</a>, people are traveling abroad without awareness that they are infected. This boosts the spread of the disease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, there is a great deal of criticism toward Chinese people, as they are being blamed for bringing the virus into new countries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend admitted that she has been upset by certain interactions on our own campus. Even though she returned to school in early January, when the disease had just begun to spread, her family and friends are still in Wuhan. “There is nothing I can do, except tell them to wear masks,” she recalled. She said she feels helpless and is deeply concerned for her family and friends. The harmful comments that she has observed on the news and social media posts have depressed her further. The news blames people from Wuhan for consuming exotic animals and traveling during this time period. </span>My friend feels disappointed when she notices the people around her acting extremely cautious, as if she herself is some kind of virus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It hurts,” my friend confessed. “People should not generalize and attribute the virus to the whole Chinese population.” She pointed out that “there are restaurants refusing to allow Chinese people in.” While it is true that the disease originated from China, extrapolating this to all Chinese people is not a productive reaction. </span>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another,”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was both surprised by and sympathetic to what my friend from Wuhan has encountered. The response of unfair overgeneralization hurts people’s feelings. As a Chinese student myself, this is especially disheartening to hear about. Next time you meet an international student, throw away the stereotypes and maybe take a moment to learn about who they really are. If they are a Chinese student from Wuhan, ask them, “How are your parents? Is your family doing okay?” or simply respond with a hug. That would be sweet. I hope our world can become better with a little respect and a lot of empathy, because sometimes a little consideration goes a long way. </span></p>\n<p><em>– Jessica Kuo</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara students should not be overly paranoid about coronavirus spreading to our campus. First of all, since the disease originated in China, the only way for the virus to get to Santa Barbara would be from a community member traveling to and from China. As most UCSB faculty and students returned from winter break before the virus was discovered, we are not at high risk of contraction. Santa Barbara doesn’t have an international airport and it isn’t an overly popular tourist city. There is very little chance that the citizens here have been exposed to the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/18/world/18reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most airlines have recently canceled flights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between China and other countries. The federal government has also </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/02/05/travel-restrictions-tied-coronavirus-stall-travel-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enacted a new policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that all tourists from China must be quarantined and observed for 14 days, which is the extent of the incubation period of the virus, before they can leave and go about their business. The last two cases in California have been confined and quarantined to hospitals. The virus is still far away from us. It is an overreaction to ask for our campus to be shut down.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the chances of exposure to coronavirus are very low, we cannot presume our community is a completely safe zone. Along with coronavirus, there are also several kinds of influenza circulating in the U.S. Students should wear masks to protect themselves from catching the flu from public areas, especially in crowded places, such as the library or large lecture halls. Since some symptoms of these flus are similar to the coronavirus infection, people who have a fever, cough and breathing difficulties should visit Student Health and receive a diagnosis for their illness. After that, they should avoid going to crowded places or talking to other people without a mask because the flu is also highly contagious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, for students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks. All we mask-wearers want to do is keep viruses and disease from spreading. Please do not laugh at people wearing masks or insult them for doing so. Be friendly and sympathetic and let hope fill our campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hondong Huang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Chinese international student who wants to pursue a career in health, I have to raise my voice: The epidemic is not an excuse to be racist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am fortunate to have not yet personally experienced any racial prejudice at UC Santa Barbara. However, my best friend, who studies at Emerson College in Boston, was verbally assaulted by a couple of strangers because she is Asian and wore a mask. Also, some of my non-Chinese friends have told me that their parents have advised them to stay away from Chinese people. I was shocked and saddened to hear that people would start to blame and fear an entire ethnicity during this health emergency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these people fail to realize that the Chinese are just as afraid as everyone else — or possibly even more afraid. We are scared and sad because our friends, families and the cities we were raised in are struggling during this catastrophe. Right now, it’s the Lunar New Year, which is the equivalent of the winter holidays for Western cultures, the time of year for family reunions and to spread love and support. However, this year people are quarantined, separated and facing discrimination. The social stigma against Chinese people is growing worse, and when people are quick to blame, fewer are inclined to help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chinese are not a public threat; the virus and those exposed to the outbreak are. This is not an issue of ethnicity, religion, physical appearance, gender, geography or nationality. This is simple science: it’s about a virus spreading among humans and affecting people’s health. This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim. Racial prejudice born of this epidemic isolates Chinese people, causing whoever is experiencing symptoms to hide their illness, contributing further to the public health crisis. So stop blaming an entire segment of the population and instead help protect our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information about the evolving coronavirus epidemic is being clearly and effectively conveyed to the public. As a part of this community, it’s our responsibility to get information from reliable sources and stop panicking. Don’t hate or judge people of Chinese ethnicity. Keep up with the news, focus on the facts and advocate for public health to actively protect our community.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Enjia Zhang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wuhan is known to have a large exotic meat market, which is why the virus is thought to have originated from one of the animals sold at the market. It was originally thought that the virus could only be spread from direct contact with an infected animal. However, as more information about coronavirus comes to light, researchers have concluded that this disease can also spread from human contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As densely populated areas, Isla Vista and the UC Santa Barbara campus are prime locations for diseases to spread; coronavirus is no exception. However, there is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic. It is crucial that the UCSB community stays up to date with accurate information about the virus in order to remain safe and healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact. It is still unclear whether or not the virus can be passed through touch, such as by touching a surface that an infected person has also touched. Because of the nature of the disease, it is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and often — especially before and after coming into contact with your face, eyes or nose.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another crucial step that UCSB students can take to prevent the spread of this virus is staying home when they are sick and avoiding close contact with others who are sick with any illness. If the sickness persists, it is imperative to visit a doctor. While the odds of contracting coronavirus in this area are extremely low, early diagnosis can be key in disease prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the measures that should be taken to prevent a possible case of coronavirus are essentially the same measures that should be taken to avoid any common contagious virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the most up-to-date information, UCSB students should consult credible websites such as that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or speak with their local health care providers. If the public is well-informed and aware of the symptoms and proper preventative measures, it will be easier for health care providers to treat and contain the virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there has been much unnecessary hysteria surrounding the outbreak of this disease. To avoid this, well-informed students should pass along reliable information to others. It is important for the community to be educated in order to keep everyone well versed on the nature of the virus. We should encourage friends and peers to watch out for signs and symptoms while simultaneously keeping in mind that these symptoms could be — and most likely are — indicative of any number of viruses. We must also encourage our community members to maintain healthy living habits, such as washing hands and keeping clean living spaces. In doing so, the UCSB community can remain safe and educated on the outbreak of this world health epidemic.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Maya Wohl</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My homeland is severely suffering from coronavirus. People are forced to stay in their homes and are in great danger. As the virus is still being researched, experts and scientists are not yet certain of the modes of transmission or effective treatments. Thus, people must take up their own efforts to defend themselves against it. Many families and individuals in China are now struggling against the fatal virus, including family members of international students here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we are studying in a foreign country, our minds are consumed with our home country. It is extremely distressing to see that our prosperous hometowns are now empty cities, and many factories and schools are being transformed into temporary hospitals. To help our country get through this difficult time, international students have tried our best to transport medical supplies back to China. Among these supplies, masks and protective suits are most important for avoiding further infection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the UCSB campus, the prevalence of mask-wearing has recently led to an increased amount of discrimination. Although I have never personally experienced this, I have witnessed and read about plenty of racist attacks around the world against Chinese people. We want people to know that most of us never lived in the city where the virus originated and that most of us have not been back to China since the outbreak began. We have had no contact with the virus, so there is no reason for Chinese students to be ostracized. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though coronavirus originated in China, Chinese people should not be labeled as ill or contaminated. Coronavirus is a catastrophe for all human beings, not only Chinese people. Mankind must stick together to persist through collective difficulty. Just like Ebola and -CoV, coronavirus is not anyone’s fault — including those who have been infected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, thousands of people were infected by H1N1, or swine flu, a widespread flu which originated in Mexico. However, no one blamed a certain country or race for that pandemic. Though China is working tirelessly to fight against coronavirus and minimize the global death toll, some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese students are wearing face masks as a protective measure, because we don’t want to be infected by other people. We are not sick.  I hope the racist behaviors will stop and we can avoid imposing further psychological harm to Chinese students.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Liuyi Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t look at me like I am some kind of freak!” This is what I want to tell the xenophobic students at UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the outbreak of coronavirus, all Chinese students have been put on high alert: many of them started to wear face masks in order to minimize chances of infection. Some people on campus who may not be aware of the seriousness of the situation seem bothered by Chinese students wearing masks. Holly Smith, an administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator at UCSB, suggested that there is no need for those who have not been infected by the virus to wear masks. Yet, the incubation period, the contagious stage of the virus, can last up to 14 days. The purpose of wearing masks is simply to protect one another from the risk of getting infected. Although there are no confirmed cases at UCSB, it is still necessary to implement preventative methods.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the chance of an outbreak in Santa Barbara is extremely low, Chinese students are not willing to take any chances. I sincerely ask UCSB students to stop being xenophobic toward the virus. We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease. It is indecent for people to discriminate against any racial group, especially during such a sensitive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural differences also account for this misguided attitude toward mask-wearing. Unlike in western cultures, mask-wearing is a common method of illness prevention in China and other Asian countries. Not only do we wear masks during flu season, we also put on face masks whenever we are sick to stop an illness from spreading further. Face masks certainly do a better job of this than sneezing and coughing into an elbow. And for those who are not sick, masks can diminish the chances of becoming infected.        </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am really sorry that students wearing masks on campus is causing some people to panic. I hope that other students will educate themselves about the benefits of face masks and the good intentions of Chinese students who wear them. We do this not only for our own health, but also for the protection of the people around us.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hao Gong</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

If someone told me that large agrochemical giants like Bayer-Monsanto and Syngenta, makers of these chemicals, contribute upwards of </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/sponsored-projects\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$31 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in funding for research to the UC system, I’d fact-check them. As a proud UC student, I was surprised and disappointed to learn that all of this is in fact true.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last spring I learned of an issue that in my four years as an environmental studies major at UCSB I had barely ever heard of: widespread toxic herbicide use within the UC system. This issue is not one-dimensional nor easily fixable; there are many stakeholders and many justifications. Education on the alternatives to herbicide use is limited, and it doesn’t help when UC’s own Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources emphasizes the negative impacts of weeds, as opposed to the negative impacts of weedkillers. The issue relates to a broader issue of institutional priorities that have, time and time again, put students, faculty, employees and community members at risk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brief history: In the spring of 2017, Mackenzie Feldman and Bridget Gustafson showed up for Cal beach volleyball practice, where their coach cautioned the team not to chase after the balls that rolled off the court. The groundskeepers had just sprayed an herbicide in the surrounding area. Bridget and Mackenzie were shocked to learn that the herbicide sprayed was Ranger Pro, which contains a </span><a href=\"http://www.cdms.net/ldat/ld6FU017.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high amount </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><a href=\"https://beyondpesticides.org/assets/media/documents/pesticides/factsheets/bp-fact-glyosphate.082017.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">glyphosate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This was two years after the </span><a href=\"https://www.iarc.fr/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Health Organization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had ruled that glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen. Bridget and Mackenzie asked the groundskeepers not to spray anymore, and in return, the volleyball team would pick the weeds themselves. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this incident, Mackenzie, now a UC Berkeley alumna, and Bridget, currently a senior at UC Berkeley, have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the use of glyphosate and other toxic herbicides throughout the UC system. Together they launched the </span><a href=\"https://www.herbicidefreecampus.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herbicide Free Campus campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to reduce and eventually ban the use of toxic herbicides. Due to the pressure that this student movement put on the UC system, the President of the UC System, Janet Napolitano, </span><a href=\"https://2f7nhsvfj5dyz0312njuuj14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CHANCELLORSetal_herbicides_050719-copy.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temporarily banned glyphosate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last May. Along with the ban, Napolitano established the UC Herbicide Taskforce, comprised of faculty members and other key stakeholders, including Bridget Gustafson herself. The Taskforce met with experts within and outside of the UC system to learn more about this issue. They will be providing unbiased recommendations next week to the President regarding the future use of glyphosate and other herbicides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it turns out that the Taskforce was not completely unbiased. UC Davis plant and weed scientist Brad Hanson, one of the specialists appointed to the Taskforce, </span><a href=\"https://cchealth.org/ipm/committee/pdf/2018-0315-pc.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">receives funding from</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bayer-Monsanto. Hanson put together a panel of experts to talk to the Taskforce, and at least two individuals he chose have ties to Monsanto. One expert he called on, the director of the UC Weed Research and Information Center, Dr. Kassim Al- Khatib, w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as</span><a href=\"https://www.organicconsumers.org/blog/kennedy-monsanto-roundup-cancer-trial-herbicide-expert\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> paid by Monsanto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to testify in favor of the company in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto Company trial. Dewayne Johnson later sued Monsanto because soon after, a piece of equipment malfunctioned. He was doused in Ranger Pro and consequently developed Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer.</span><a href=\"https://time.com/5460793/dewayne-lee-johnson-monsanto-lawsuit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The jury awarded</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Johnson $289 million, which was later </span><a href=\"https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2018/10/judge-reduces-award-but-upholds-verdict-in-roundup-case-against-bayers-monsanto/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to $79 million, but Monsanto continues to insist that their product is non-carcinogenic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Hanson’s conflict of interest was exposed, his voting privileges in the UC Herbicide Taskforce were revoked and he has since resigned. While this was a small victory in attempting to rid Taskforce decision-making of corrupt corporate influence, it remains to be seen what the President and the UC Regents will do regarding the use of glyphosate and other toxic herbicides on campuses across California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing herbicide use on campuses can be challenging. Land managers have budget constraints and aesthetic goals to reach. There are costs and benefits: organic herbicides can be more expensive and require more frequent applications, but they keep both the land managers and the soil healthier. Treating the root causes of weed growth, such as soil imbalances, can be time-intensive upfront, but reduce later need for herbicides. As seen at </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/garden/24garden.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> organic land management can save both money and water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this problem would be easier to solve if our priorities change. If we prioritize the health and safety of the land managers, students and faculty on these campuses instead of prioritizing weed-free sidewalks and medians, would it be all that bad?

Senate should not divest from Israel. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tomorrow, the Associated Students Senate at UCSB will vote on a proposed resolution to divest from companies that have ties to Israel. This resolution is part of the broader Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. BDS is an international movement that seeks to destroy, defame, and delegitimize the only Jewish state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone whose parents found a home in Israel after fleeing religious persecution during the Iranian Revolution, I feel directly targeted by this resolution. My family’s experience does not stand alone. Many Jewish Israelis are people of color who came from Middle Eastern countries where their families faced persecution and discrimination, and Israel was the only place where they could find refuge. The descendants of these refugees make up the vibrant and diverse society that is Israel. For us, Israel is a safe haven and the embodiment of our liberation. This resolution attempts to erase this history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I, like many supporters of Israel, believe there is room to criticize the state. In fact, it is open criticism of Israel that makes it stronger and a true democracy. There are legitimate ways to criticize Israel, and there are ways to express these criticisms without erasing my people’s narrative and history. This resolution is not that way.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of advancing a one-sided resolution, we should be supporting initiatives that promote a better life for Palestinians and Israelis.

He thrived on cultural trivia, arguments for the sake of debate and, most of all, plucky banter with his friends. After attending grad school at Georgetown, Steve traveled the world, bouncing from destination to destination, only to land at his final stop in Isla Vista. He had always been focused academically on math and science, but once he moved to I.V., he blossomed into the artsy-fartsy, free-spirited philosopher we all came to love. Then, with a few good friends and a strong peer group at his side, Steve opened a coffee shop called the Coffee Collaborative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Collab, as it was fondly addressed, was an offbeat and quirky shop on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero. Never having been much of a businessman, Steve ignored traditional corporate tactics and, instead, transformed the Collab into a creative, alternative space. Although it didn’t seem exceptional to some, it was everything to its employees, regulars, locals and passersby. This became the home of debates, late-night talks, laughter, chess and community. It also became, perhaps infamously, a refuge for the lost, alcoholic, homeless and the poor. Regardless of how it was perceived from the outside, the Collab was always a place of belonging and forgiveness and was never a place for judgement — that was all Steve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might even say that Steve was the purveyor of wayward souls. Perhaps he was so accepting of others because he, at heart, was a lost soul too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve was certainly not a hero, but he touched the lives of many young people; he spurred intellectual conflict, wafted at the edges of his beliefs and challenged those around him to do the same. Aside from being a philosopher, he was also an absurd comic and a wild storyteller. And although he was plagued by darkness, you’d never know it at the sound of his distinctive and well-loved laugh; it had a depth to it, came straight from the belly and would make you laugh along with him just at the sound of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like The Dude from “The Big Lebowski,” Steve always seemed to be caught up in some new fantasy or adventure. However aimless he seemed, his life was never dull and he was always able to find some sort of trouble or mischief. For those who knew him best, Steve was a complex, infectious and influential man full of love and turmoil. Whether he knew it or not, Steve was always surrounded by loved ones through his ups and downs, which was perhaps his greatest blessing. He will always be remembered by those who loved him as a staple, or perhaps a reflection, of Isla Vista and their time here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was and always will be a colorful thread in the fabric of our lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/","id":5710,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5709,5708,5707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Not Again: Protect Santa Barbara From Cat Canyon Oil Development","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2019-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gordon Hahn and Alexandra Leal Silva take a stand against the construction of oil wells in Santa Barbara.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            \r\n<p>UC Santa Barbara is a paradise surrounded by its strong tides and unique landscape.

The oil wells would use the “steam fracking” method which relies heavily on vast amounts of water and natural gas. To supply this gas, new pipelines would have to be constructed along highways 101 and 135. The oil wells would use the gas to heat the water to steam in order to loosen the thick crude oil from the ground. This process requires an estimated seven to eight million gallons of freshwater. Amidst California’s ever-present specter of drought, it does not have the freshwater resources nor the appetite for risk to follow through with such a commitment.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, this oil scheme threatens the ecological health and air quality of Santa Barbara County’s ecosystems. <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">Aera Energy’s project</a> alone would require bulldozing 300 acres of land, moving three million cubic feet of earth and uprooting 1,500 oak trees. This would destroy the habitats and even lives of animals and plants, hurting our precious ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On top of these disastrous changes, the mere functioning of these oil wells would increase the amount of fossil fuel pollutants into the air. The wells generate high amounts of particulate matter, specifically toxic hydrogen sulfide. Also, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">the proposal would bring an additional 156 oil tanker trips per day</a> to local roadways, polluting more carbon emission gases.  Finally, the oil production process involves toxic chemicals, including benzene, toluene, xylene and many others, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">which can impact hormone production and cause cancer and birth defects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most insidious danger of this plan is the certainty of an oil spill. Spills are not just possible but expected. The Environmental Impact Reports for the wells anticipate spills from both wells and pipelines. As of 2017, there were as many as <a href=\"http://www.sbcan.org/issues_maps\">60 active investigations</a> of petroleum contamination being conducted by Sisquoc and Guadalupe. ERG itself estimates <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">18 spills over the next 10 years</a>. This estimation echoes the company’s track record, having been responsible for 21 oil spills between 2011 and 2015, resulting in over <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">20,000 gallons of spilled crude</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These <a href=\"http://350sb.org/no-new-oil-wells/\">spills will endanger the Santa Maria Valley Groundwater Basin</a>, the major source of freshwater for 200,000 people in 12 cities, including Santa Maria, Orcutt and Guadalupe. The most glaring threat of this project is that it will be constructed just 1,900 feet, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">less than a mile, from Benjamin Foxen Elementary School</a> in Sisquoc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While oil construction projects are usually framed as creating jobs, the cost of oil and contaminant cleanup can be prodigious. The most recent of the catastrophic oil spills took place only a few years ago in 2015. The Refugio Oil Spill cost taxpayers about $100 million in clean up. Taxpayers and the local community bear the burden of paying the additional damage to ecosystems, loss of animal and plant life and closures of recreational areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One would think that Santa Barbara would know better about increasing the presence and of oil corporations; only 50 years ago, our county suffered the disastrous and infamous 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill. This calamity brought our community together in tackling the influence of oil companies in our democratic institutions. From this low point, the people of Santa Barbara sparked the epicenter of the modern environmentalist movement, which has only benefited our country with environmental health and sustainable economic growth. It is important to recall this history in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. We stand with our fellow residents and organizations that oppose this empty and dangerous project. The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.<br><br><em>Students interested in these ongoing efforts can email </em>gmhahn@ucsb.edu<em> or </em>alealsilva@ucsb.edu <em>for more information on how to get involved in the ongoing efforts against the Cat Canyon proposal.</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-06/not-again-protect-santa-barbara-from-cat-canyon-oil-development/","id":5712,"author":{"id":382,"name":"Gordon Hahn"},"related":[5711,5710,5709],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/opinion/letters-to-the-editor","highestPage":23}},"__N_SSG":true}
