Planning a wedding while tackling finals and securing an internship is definitely against the norm, but not unheard of. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first considered the idea of getting married during college, I cringed. I wasn’t vehemently against it, but I couldn’t help but reflect on my past terrible relationships and wonder humorously what the future would hold if I had married one of my exes. Marriage in college would be highly distracting and an obstacle I could not balance with the pressure of school. I similarly thought about my indecisiveness in college so far and some of my friends who have changed their major at least a dozen times. How can someone be that sure about committing to someone in college when so many aspects of a college student’s life are constantly up in the air? I’ve changed so much from one year to another, and I couldn’t imagine how much I would adapt to marriage during these formative years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not just my reservations. It’s hard to think about the prospect of marriage in college when girls at universities are constantly tweeting about how they </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=text%20back&amp;src=typed_query\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“can’t get a text back.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are there college students out there who are truly mature enough to be in a seriously committed — not to mention legally binding — relationship and are willing to be tied down for the rest of their lives at age 20? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, there have been various stories about couples who have gotten married in college — some heartwarming and others disheartening. Reading through a </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2v810z/guys_who_got_married_in_college_what_happened_how/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit thread</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of couples who married in college, I was amazed by how many couples got married in their first or second year of college and who have been together for 10, maybe even 20 years since then, living together happily with kids. Of course, some weren’t as lucky and ended up divorcing because their life paths inevitably moved in very different directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have a few friends who have gotten married right when they hit college — all married to guys enlisted in the military. It is not unexpected that military marriages occur right before deployment because of </span><a href=\"https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2014/12/11/married-military-look-inside-young-military-marriages/20263373/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term separation, among other factors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My best friend from middle school and the better half of high school ended up getting married at the end of high school, which I could have never imagined happening. One moment, I could remember us running around in her neighborhood (quite literally) chasing after a boy we both liked, and the next, she had a serious boyfriend for four years whom she married in a small ceremony. It was a shock to my system, especially since she ultimately ended up giving up a lot of her dreams for him, like dropping out of college and forgoing her veterinary aspirations to live with him in California where he is stationed. But ultimately, I did know one thing: She loved being with him, no matter the cost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in young adulthood are so dynamic and clouded by uncertainty. One day, you could be celebrating your birthday with your best friend, and the next year, she’s gone from your life without so much as a “happy birthday” text. If you can find a built-in best friend in a marital partner during the craziness that is college, that is definitely something to cherish. Having someone who is a constant in your life, with whom you can share the exciting and devastating moments is comforting, to say the least. It’s nice to have someone who won’t outgrow you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think part of the problem people have with college students getting married is that we have become a largely judgemental society. We adhere to an unrealistic timeline of when major life events should “ideally” occur that defines what is and is not socially acceptable. Not only is this timeline plastered </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-age-to-get-married-is-26-2017-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all over the internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it is also ingrained in familial expectations: Graduate college, get a job, get married somewhere between the ages of 24-28 and have kids before 35. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to reflect on our predisposed notions of how others should live their lives. Because at the end of the day, who should really care if you’re breaking the norm? If you found the right person that brings you immense happiness — why wait?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, college students are constantly evolving and maturing, often for the first time on their own. I definitely have experienced personal growth from high school to college when it comes to seeing the red flags in my relationships. I’ve witnessed the dissolution of some of my friends’ romantic relationships as a consequence of misunderstanding each other or having stark contrasting visions for their futures. I believe that at the end of the day, if someone is in your life who accepts you fundamentally and wants to grow with you, they’re worth holding onto. Marriage at a young age can ultimately contribute to a unique perspective that can yield purpose and focus that others won’t experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will not deny that my personality trait of being a hopeless romantic has contributed to my altered stance on marriage in college. While I haven’t been involved in the healthiest romantic relationships and have yet to date a guy who has truly cherished and accepted me for the person I am, I’ve seen deep respect in a relationship form almost effortlessly in couples around me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve seen the spark blow out in a relationship of mine and reignite with someone new just as fast as the next week. People enter our lives at very fateful moments, and when we individually decide to get married should ultimately depend on individual circumstances — not outside influences or societal expectations.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai encourages you to make individualized decisions independent of socially constructed ideals. </span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94091\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94091\" data-attachment-id=\"94091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-01/argument-in-the-office-married-during-college/college-marriage-opinion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"college marriage opinion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94091\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melody Wang / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Say No To the Dress</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Sara Rubin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picture this. You are standing in an aisle, staring at the love of your life while your friends and family watch you take a vow that will last for eternity. During my childhood, I was ingrained with the idea of a magical fairytale wedding. Disney Princess movies gave me a conventional and outdated model. They filled me with hopes that my prince charming would one day rescue me with a kiss. Later in life, romantic movies taught me that at the end of the day, love always wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I am nearing almost 20 years old, and the fantasy wedding I used to dress my Barbie dolls up for is the furthest thing from my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that I have stopped believing in love. I still hold on to the notion that one day I will find my knight in shining armor. But while taking marriage vows and having a family are important to me, I could never imagine committing myself to someone for the rest of my life in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s begin by assuming that one has already met the love of their life this early. The first point I would like to emphasize is how young and inexperienced we all are. Most of us have never owned our own apartment or house, have never had a full time job and don’t know what it is like to be 100% independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newfound freedom we experience in college is an important stepping stone towards becoming full-fledged adults. However, if one decides to get married at this young age, they are skipping past the growth and change you experience when you are forced to stand on your own two feet. Life is full of uncertainties, and while having someone by your side is a constant that can bring comfort, you are also hindering your capability to rely on yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strength and new skills one acquires when living on their own can help prepare a person for the uncertainties that can be thrown at them in the future. This dependence on another can lead one to forgo taking responsibility for their own actions, as they will always expect someone else to help them with their mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, one never learns how to accept being alone. My grandmother always told me that “we must be the center of our own universe, because the one constant in our lives is ourselves.” As college students, we are experiencing a pivotal and impressionable time in our lives, and if we don’t learn how to not only accept but enjoy being alone, then we will never have the strength to get through life with just ourselves. Self-love and self-confidence are what drive us to reach for our dreams, and to be happy with who we are. That is a rather difficult goal to achieve when someone else provides emotional security for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to point out how important exposing oneself to different relationships is. While I have dated a few people already, I would not feel ready to commit the rest of my life to another person without going through at least a few more heartbreaks. Relationships teach us important lessons regarding life, and help us find out who we truly are. Marriage is a huge step, and I know I will need more practice being in  relationships before taking it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating also shows us what qualities we want in a partner, and what qualities we don’t. These lessons are a gift that help reveal more of who we are. Not many other circumstances in life can better demonstrate one’s strength than having to overcome a breakup. To have that history is imperative. When we finally find the person we want to be with, we will have learned from our past and understood what it takes to really make a relationship work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time in our lives we are undergoing massive changes. Grad schools or job offers can be across the country from one another, and it’s difficult to pick up your whole life and move when another person is involved. If your partner keeps you from pursuing your full potential, you may begin to resent one another. Sacrifice is often needed for a marriage to work; however, to forgo such big opportunities is unfair for everyone involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes occur in ourselves as well. I often hear adults say that the person they were in college is nothing like the person they are today. We mature and learn an abundance of lessons during this period and sometimes the individual you marry will not be the same person years later. This “metamorphosis” can change how two people work together, and turn a once-perfect marriage sour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, this argument is not to deter people from marrying altogether.

SoCal is the stuff movies are made of, home to beaches like Laguna, Santa Monica, Venice, Newport, Huntington… the list goes on. At these beaches, it’s possible to swim, scuba dive and tan to your heart’s content. The palm tree-studded streets, postcard-worthy coastline views and amazingly warm climate are just some of the features that make it the more enjoyable half of California. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can never get bored living in Southern California — the sprawling urban environment of the Los Angeles area offers so much to do and see. It is a hub of cultural fusion, with vibrant destinations like Koreatown and Little Tokyo. On your way to the historic Hollywood sign, you might even run into a celebrity or two, or attend a TV show taping. Los Angeles, after all, is the most star-studded city in the world, since so many movies are filmed in the area. You could also go for a stroll along the gorgeous Santa Monica Pier, where you can spend your time doing anything from riding the Ferris wheel at Pacific Park to testing your Skee-Ball skills at Playland Arcade. Driving down Pacific Coast Highway will give you the scenic Californian road trip you’ve always dreamed of. A weekend getaway to Palm Springs or even a quick trip to Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive for some window shopping provides a break from the stressors of everyday life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s something for everyone here. Interested in art? SoCal hosts a plethora of museums like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Getty and The Broad, to name a few. These are great places to take pics for the ‘gram. Additionally, the Carlsbad Flower Fields, Griffith Observatory, Balboa Park and Joshua Tree National Park are just some examples of other ideal photo opportunities for aspiring influencers to show off their picturesque SoCal lifestyle. The Bay Area, of course, is home to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, but the wind, fog and lack of natural lighting can make the perfect picture hard to capture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about animal lovers? The gold standard of zoos can be found right in downtown San Diego. A vast array of cageless exhibits allows visitors to see animals while walking through artful landscapes and other unique attractions. The Aquarium of the Pacific and SeaWorld are some of the top locations to visit sea animals in Southern California. If you prefer to see them in their natural habitats, La Jolla Cove in San Diego is the go-to for watching cute sea lions sunbathing on the rocks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal is also brimming with renowned eateries and worldwide dishes, from authentic Vietnamese food in Little Saigon to the abundance of Asian restaurants and boba shops in Irvine. Southern California is also where you can find some of the best Mexican cuisine in the nation, with real Mexican food one road trip away if the foodie in you is feeling adventurous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything that happens happens in SoCal. Festivals like the one and only Coachella are held in Southern California, along with fairs like the Orange County Fair and LA County Fair. Conferences for interests of all kinds, whether it be comics, YouTube or anime also take place here. SoCal hosts almost all the awards shows including the Academy Awards, Grammys, Oscars and Golden Globes. Not to mention, concerts by the biggest artists of our time are always happening in local SoCal venues such as the Hollywood Bowl.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During spooky season, many SoCal natives flock to Universal Studios for Halloween Horror Nights or Knott’s Scary Farm. Don’t forget that the happiest place on Earth can also be found in Southern California. Disneyland, located in Anaheim, is one of the world’s most famed amusement park sites and is a source of nostalgia and good memories for people all around the globe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, but certainly not least, our very own town, Santa Barbara is located in Southern California. Downtown SB has much to offer, including scenic State Street, lined with charming white stucco buildings and a number of cute boutiques and restaurants. Stearns Wharf is also a historic pier with lots of great additional dining and shopping options. The city is surrounded by the beach, its sunsets are the eighth wonder of the world and it’s home to UC Santa Barbara. SoCal represents everything good in the world — the other half of the state really can’t compete.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo believes Bay Area inferiority rests on the fact that her opponent Marko, who eats his pasta unseasoned, is from there.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91223\" style=\"width: 488px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91223\" data-attachment-id=\"91223\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/argument-in-the-office-norcal-vs-socal/norcalsocal/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?fit=1022%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1022,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"norcalsocal\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?fit=766%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91223\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=478%2C639\" alt=\"\" width=\"478\" height=\"639\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?w=1022&amp;ssl=1 1022w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=768%2C1027&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=766%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 766w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/norcalsocal.png?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-91223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jessica Ko / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Boba, the Bay and Why LA Absolutely Sucks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Marko Ristic</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Aye, good looks. Tryna cut cut, or go to T4? They got hella options now, shit slaps on moms.” “T4? Fasho.” The vernacular of a Bay Area native such as this specimen can be difficult to understand, so let me serve as a translator. “Good looks” is the equivalent of a good job, “cut cut” is synonymous with going home, “shit slaps” just means it’s really good, “on moms” signifies that one believes what they say so much, they would put their mom’s life on the line to prove it and “fasho” is simply a lazy way of saying “for sure.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s be honest with ourselves: Doesn’t this lingo sound just a little </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cool? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if deep-down, a small, fashion-forward voice within yourself is whispering to you, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We should talk like that.” </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I agree — you should.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bay Area is a place like no other, unrivaled in its vernacular, abundance of boba tea shops and vibrant art scene, all of which can be witnessed in a five-minute walk through San Francisco. Now, you may be thinking: Marko, aren’t you biased because you’re from the Bay? You would be absolutely correct. But even taking a more objective approach, you will clearly see why the Bay is undoubtedly superior to LA.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start by looking at some of the basics. Although Los Angeles may have a lower cost of living than downtown San Francisco, there are many more places in the Bay that aren’t SF: Richmond, Oakland and San Jose all have cheaper living alternatives than LA. Additionally, the Bay, thanks to Caltrain and BART, has set up a complex and cheap</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public transport system, one which prevents a phenomenon similar to LA’s abysmal traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, let’s compare the food. Yes, LA is home to trendy, basic, Instagram-popular restaurants, but how good does all that aesthetically pleasing food actually taste?  Despite its lack of trendy food spots, the Bay is home to a variety of great-tasting restaurants. A melting pot of different cultures, the Bay offers food options that are as diverse as the people that reside there — nowhere else can you find such a variety of restaurants to choose from. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, and most importantly, Bay Area culture is far superior to that of LA. Am I in any way qualified to talk about LA culture? Not in the slightest. Am I going to do it anyway? At this point you should know the answer is most definitely yes. Like I mentioned earlier, the Bay is home to a myriad of diverse people from different backgrounds, and although LA undoubtedly has its fair share of diversity as well, it’s hard to compete with the Bay’s Asian hypebeasts obsessed with Palace’s latest drop; the up-and-coming SoundCloud rappers with their distinct Bay Area sound; the beach bums that wake up at 5 a.m. to go surfing; or even the high-profile business executives who travel 30 minutes out of the way just to get their made-to-order Philz Coffee. This diversity plays a major role in not only the variety of cultures that exist within Bay Area natives, but also the variety of ideas shared and discussed as well. The Bay is a place that values discussion, and as such has fostered an environment where discourse and creativity are celebrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bay is unique — not just in its colloquialisms and boba shops, but also in its people and ideas.

(“Is it ‘ca-chay’ or nah…?” “It’s ‘cache,’ dude!” Ever considered “cage?”)</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from the arguably subjective life-changing spiritual experience of getting back in touch with nature and one’s body and mind, there are health benefits to earthing as well. Everyone says bare feet are more prone to infections, but no one thinks about the detrimental health effects of shoes (unstable ankles and joints, blisters and deformed feet). Researchers are now </span><a href=\"https://dermalmedix.com/walking-barefoot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that earthing may be just as good for your body as it is for your spirit. Yet, for most of our generation, shoes seem to be first and foremost about style rather than comfort, let alone orthopedic concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even if it’s healthy, are there any educational or recreational benefits? This is not at all about what y’all are thinking: kinky sexual fetishes. At least not for all of us earthers. Instead, it is a search for universal human happiness. Ask yourselves: Have you recently spent a shoeless afternoon in the park with your loved ones? Have you ever driven a stick shift barefoot? Ever cracked open a cold one with your toes? Alright, alright, maybe not all of that, Mrs. Grundy. But at the end of the day we can agree that the best thing about shoes is taking them off once you get home. I was told it’s almost like the getting-rid-of-your-bra sensation: Freedom, comfort and protection by and through your bare body.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not only about liberation, though. Earthing is about the awareness of human waste, cigarette butts and broken beer bottles on the street. At the same time, we are all equal (or equally gross) without shoes as opposed to the luxury, high prices and social pressure associated with them. In many cases, there might be a pinch of arrogance involved with feeling alternative and good about yourself because no one else does it. But just imagine a world where we’d all do it. Without any artificial feet protection, we would naturally care more about hygiene and pollution and less about looks or material beauty because our health would be dependent on a clean environment.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                                                                  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a study abroad student, my attitude towards dress, and particularly footwear, in I.V. is similar to performing at drunken Wednesday karaoke nights at Rockfire. There’s room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares. And this is not just due to favorable geographical conditions of beaches, fields and forests. It is because of UCSB’s liberal student body, the fact that there are surfboard racks in front of residence halls and people wearing flip-flops to class. With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing haters usually base their arguments around comfort, hygiene and looks. Granted, the library is a sacred space of learning and reflection for some of our fellow humans. But then, how is earthing different from unpacking your smelly Subway meatball marinara sub in the eighth floor quiet rooms? Once your interpretation of personal freedom infringes on someone else’s, asking politely for permission is in order, whether it’s fast food or your extremities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And seriously, how are bare feet really that different from bare hands? Are we having a glove debate too? I doubt it. This hints at the importance of social constructivism regarding the norms and shared societal expectations of “civilized” behaviour. This is not to demand all-out nudity but to provide some impetus to think about the boundaries we have created. Essentially, we give behaviour and style meaning through our everyday discourse and the persistence of unquestioned traditional taboos. Let’s just forget about the whole shoe madness for a second and take off our fussy socks, both physically and mentally.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages students and staff to think beyond socially-constructed boundaries and choose nature over materialism.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88168\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88168\" data-attachment-id=\"88168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/argument-in-the-office-is-barefooting-an-acceptable-practice/shoes-nexus-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=650%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shoes-nexus-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88168\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?resize=650%2C366\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>No Such Thing as the Right to Bare Feet</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Kat Chen</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My opponent Mr. Ahrens has given not only his opinion but has also slipped in gentle words of insidious guidance towards this Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile practice. Simon hails from Göttingen, Germany by way of England. His year of exchange in the U.S. gives him, in his own words, “room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I care, Simon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hobbesian ideals of human freedom locked so seamlessly into our revolutionary founding texts lure millions of hopeless romantics like Simon to see this country as a land of exploration. I am tired of white men frolicking through Isla Vista barefoot like the world is their backyard: it began with Columbus, with Lewis and Clark, with Neil Armstrong. The set of soil-crusted toenails perched next to my ear in Pollock Theater is new wave Manifest Destiny. But these “earthers” do not explore uncharted waters or unknown lands. They are not lunar heroes of the Cold War. They are only the disciples of a false gospel, victims to their own disgusting faith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much ink has been spilt lauding the joys of being barefoot. On a hot day in mid-July, I can imagine plunging my feet into the beachy banks of a quiet lake, my toes wiggling through the baked surface to reach the wet sand underneath. On an endless stretch of grass, I see myself prying off both shoes and socks, lying down and letting scratchy sprouts envelop me, head to toe. In the tenderness of my own home, I will sit, criss-cross applesauce, nothing between my soles and the green plush of my carpet. The simplicity of these pleasures must be the source of inspiration for earthing. My sympathies end there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon argues that I have caved to the “norms and shared societal expectations of ‘civilized’ behaviour.” He has basically called me, and all of us who wear shoes, sheeple. While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed. There’s a reason we cyberbully flat-earthers, climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers: for the good of the herd and for the safety of future generations, we must uphold truths that serve to propel progress. Shoes protect us from tetanus, I.V.’s balmy 42-degree weather and street vomit from last Thursday. They act as a buffer between the outside world and the inside, marking clear boundaries between where public spaces end and personal ones begin. The eschewing (e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing? Ha!) of these thresholds is a privilege exploited by the barefoot of Isla Vista. Most of the responses to my post on our Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page seeking earthers were written by, you guessed it, white students. Remember: “No Shoes, No Service” does not apply equally to all who roam shoeless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing’s health claims, based on the alleged power of electrons from the ground to counteract the body’s free radicals (to treat anything from depression to cancer), cling to studies like</span> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one from 2012, co-authored by Stephen Sinatra, a co-author of “Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever!” by Clinton Ober, Sinatra and Martin Zucker. Despite the study’s complete ignorance of “correlation does not equal causation,” earthing is now a small empire, with a vast offering of official Earthing® products targeted towards its cult of believers. Yours for the hot deal of only $69.99, the Earthing Wearables Kit comes with, unbelievably, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">socks</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For your feet. To wear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The claim that earthing is “the most important health discovery ever” isn’t doing wonders for its reputation either. To prove their proclaimed faith to revert to a Paleolithic age, I invite earthers to renounce all modern medicine: the smallpox vaccine, the MRI, even their eyeglasses. If they can’t read the slides, maybe they’ll stop attending my lectures. Maybe then the calloused, punctured, reeking, selfish symbol of American liberty will finally stop encroaching on my minimal expectations of personal freedoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I would never get into your car if you insisted on driving stick shift barefoot.

Despite my doubts, I would watch Miss Universe every year and see women who looked seemingly perfect. Like many, I wondered if I could be them one day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, beauty pageants revolved around the judgement of physical attributes, but since have evolved to include personality and talent. The talent competition, contestant profile and numerous question and answer portions illustrate this very point. They now strive to be </span><a href=\"https://todayvenezuela.com/2019/01/06/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-more-diverse-than-ever/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more inclusive of all races</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the intent of the Miss Universe pageant being “a way to celebrate women and diversity.” Additionally, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/17/miss-spain-becomes-first-transgender-woman-compete-miss-universe-pageant/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.731737227223\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first transgender contestant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> competed in the Miss Universe 2018 competition. While this may seem like a step in the right direction, the overwhelming public opinion says otherwise, arguing that </span><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-still-sexist-as-hell-and-not-what-we-need-right-now\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beauty pageants are sexist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of the burdensome expectations they impose on women to be “gorgeous, intelligent, and poised.” These critics often target the evening gown and swimsuit competition as the basis of their claims, as those parts of the competition are based solely on physical appearance. Miss America has responded to this enduring criticism by</span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ending-swimsuit-competition_us_5b167608e4b093ac33a1d36e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cutting the infamous swimsuit and evening gown competitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead aiming to focus on “honoring talent and scholarship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience. I was mostly piqued by curiosity and wanting to try something new, especially since it’s such a popular tradition in the South. There are many </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/literally-darling/trying-to-be-pretty-in-a-southern-beauty-pageant-town_b_7623954.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">societal expectations of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> associated with the notion of “Southern hospitality” that pervade the South; high importance is placed on appearing charming, beautiful, and poised. This is a direct link to the traditional archetype of Southern beauty and femininity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I did not fit the description of a stereotypical girl who would be interested in competing in beauty pageants. I was focused on my studies, my friends and my involvement in extracurriculars — not winning a beauty competition. My friend group, who were focused on similar things, surprisingly did not question my newfound curiosity. Some even showed up to watch and support me on the night of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first met girls in rehearsal who had been vying for the crown since they were toddlers, competing in numerous local and regional beauty contests to work their way up. I learned that the acquisition of one crown improved your pageant resume, in a sense, even if our high school competition was open to anyone in our school. Competing in our pageant also served as a valuable opportunity to practice poise, talent, etc. in preparation for later pageants. This, however, increased my skepticism upon entering the competition. Being the inexperienced outsider that I was, and lacking the shared intention to continue competing, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat excluded.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite both my skepticism and my expectations that all my competitors would have elitist attitudes, I unexpectedly made multiple friends during the process. Rehearsal was grueling and started uncharacteristically early for a two-hour pageant. We would practice the opening number and our exits and entrances </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over and over again</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> until I was sure that the directors in charge were taking the event way too seriously. We would laugh after rehearsal at the ridiculousness of the dance moves we had to memorize and the “walks” we had to perfect before the final day, which made me feel at ease. Although these girls had more experience than I did, they didn’t have the snobby attitudes I expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the morning of the pageant, the interview (which I didn’t prepare for) was the most telling part of the event. Every girl wore heels and bright dresses, with their makeup and hair already done. I didn’t have as much motivation to wake up early and get all of that done ahead of the 9 a.m. interview, and ended up dressing professionally with minimal makeup. Having done many academic and extracurricular interviews before, I believed I would nail it. However, the questions asked by the judges seemed almost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> serious, like they were searching for the perfect answer. They asked questions like “how do you handle cliques at school?” with facial expressions that read, “I’m not looking for an answer about real personal experience, but one that’s been rehearsed.” Despite not doing as well as I’d expected, I still had hope for the merit of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long day of preparation, the night of the pageant was still nerve-wracking, primarily because most of the girls were worried they would trip on stage or misspeak in front of the audience. When I used to watch the evening gown competition on TV, I imagined girls backstage gawking at each other, internally comparing who looked best in their dress. Instead, we all offered each other words of encouragement and praise before we individually took the stage. When the winners were announced at the end, we were happy for each other and grateful we got to develop friendships during the experience (I know, shocker!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. I didn’t realize until the end, when I found that I wasn’t as nervous onstage as I’d thought I’d be. It wasn’t that I wanted to look better than anyone, but that I felt confident in myself. But this wasn’t even the most rewarding aspect of participating. It was the moment when my mom came up to me afterwards with tears in her eyes, telling me how proud she was. To go on stage alone and walk in front of a crowd of people — many of whom attended my high school — with no prior experience as a beauty queen, was no easy feat. I didn’t care about what the judges or the audience thought of me, only about what I thought of myself, and I felt good.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants people to know the positive impacts beauty pageants can have on women.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86781\" style=\"width: 297px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86781\" data-attachment-id=\"86781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-09/argument-in-the-office-are-beauty-pageants-feminist-or-flawed/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=1792%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1792,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"beauty pageant kate ryan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=888%2C1015&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan-219x250.jpeg?resize=287%2C328\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=768%2C878&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=896%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 896w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?w=1792&amp;ssl=1 1792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Beauty Pageants: Only Skin Deep</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Emily Hickingbottom</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our current political and social climate, beauty pageants in the United States have become targets of widespread, controversial criticism. While competing in these competitions may seem innocent enough when girls are young, as years pass, competitions become increasingly focused on unrealistic physical beauty standards that can damage a girl’s self-image and confidence. Instead of teaching girls to strive for career focused and academic success, these competitions perpetuate the idea that “beauty” is a woman’s most important characteristic when determining her overall worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though certain people (*</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough cough*</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump) and recent events in the media might suggest otherwise, generally speaking, I’d like to think that we are living in a time where gender equality is the norm — particularly in the United States (though this isn’t always the reality). But, there is a startling disparity between the focus on male versus female sexuality in entertainment, specifically on television. There is a great deal of attention given to the Miss America Pageant and other pageants like it. These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements. The ideal candidate is many things: She is tall, but not too tall; thin, but not too thin; curvy, but in only the “right” places. Always smiling, always put together, always on cue. Women’s beauty and self-worth extend far beyond these superficial standards of attractiveness. Qualities involving attraction and beauty are not measured by the size of a woman’s waist or by the symmetry of her face. These measurements are shallow and speak volumes when evaluating what the Miss America competition and similar pageants represent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By allowing pageants to determine beauty or value based almost entirely on surface level characteristics, we are projecting harmful images about a woman’s “place” and purporting normative expectations of appearance, thus slowing our advancement into a more progressive society. With ever-changing definitions of femininity and beauty developing in America, competitions like Miss America, and the narrow beauty ideals they promote, are becoming increasingly outdated and are in dire need of greater scrutiny.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The danger of beauty pageants is evidenced in the name itself. They evaluate participants based solely upon physical “beauty” and reduce these women’s unique and individually remarkable features to nothing more than a series of numbers on a scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might disagree because of the question and answer portions included in some beauty pageants. While I grant that this gives the contestant an opportunity to showcase themselves outside the physical realm, there exists a long-standing expectation of fumbling failure amid this segment of the competition, held by viewers and judges alike. Contestants are called to answer what is typically a controversial, multifaceted question, who are then expected to respond eloquently, despite the pressure and lack of preparation for the question. It almost seems as if judges are waiting for contestants to fail, especially considering the judges’ and media’s reactions to incidents like </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miss-utah-usa-2013-fumbles-question_n_3451918\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miss Utah’s fumbled answers </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during her run for Miss USA in 2012.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building further on this point, we must also consider the corporate sponsorships and owners of these supposedly harmless, good-natured competitions. Of course, these large corporations would not want to promote an idea of beauty which gives women — particularly female viewers of the pageant — the idea that intellect and personal values are more important than living up to a rigid set of impossible beauty standards. If us women collectively came to that conclusion, we might not buy as much makeup, or shop as often or regularly allow men to determine our worth. We might argue more to receive equal pay or, worse yet, start speaking up for ourselves in situations where we don’t believe our interests are being equally represented. This is not to say that all businesses and corporations have these intentions, but when we stop to consider who is at the head of some of the major national pageants, it becomes apparent that their respective owners do not actively endorse gender equality, or even respect women, for that matter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, who owns them? Who has vested interests in the pageant’s success? In the case of Miss America, the owner and individual responsible for their continued success in 2015 was none other than </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/miss-usa-2018-miss-america-tries-rebrand-trump-s-former-ncna876246\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it’s safe to say that, given our current political climate and Donald Trump’s infamy in the United States, we are fully aware that his version of respecting women is far from acceptable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, I imagine watching my future daughter up on stage, competing in a Miss California or Miss USA pageant and, immediately, I am overcome with anger. In a time when gender equality and sexual freedom are at a peak in our current society, I would hope that women don’t need validation from a select group of biased judges with predisposed preferences for a narrow set of characteristics, predetermined by heterosexual, white, male owners and sponsors of the competitions. I think the idea that beauty can be defined by physical characteristics is, in and of itself, a toxic concept. If we could define beauty by a specific set of physical characteristics, then we could, theoretically, define what characteristics make an individual unattractive as well. When considering things from the reverse perspective, the thought that we can identify beauty purely based on appearance seems absolutely absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth. Generations of young women, including the young women on this campus, are presently growing up in the shadow of a misogynistic president and his anti-feminist ideals. And unfortunately, despite my belief that pageantry might have the capability to change into a valuable experience for young women under the right leadership and reform, the overwhelmingly powerful presence of men like Trump in this arena makes it extremely difficult to separate the positives from the negatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all beautiful, each of us in our own unique ways, both physically and mentally.

The major difference that comes to my mind is the length of the terms: semesters versus quarters. The term length directly relates to the depth of the education — or rather the lack thereof. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you compare the quarter and the semester system, six-month-long terms are superior to three-month-long terms because they give students the opportunity to really internalize complex topics. I like the fact that I get to learn about more topics in one academic year in the quarter system at UCSB. Nevertheless, I believe that 10 weeks is just not enough time to truly get to the bottom of any topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is not due to the total amount of time spent to study a specific topic because the units for every course are equivalent between the systems. It is rather the fact that a class taken in 10 weeks requires a much faster learning pace than one required by the same class in the semester system. The speed of the quarter system requires students to plan ahead and prioritize whichever quizzes or presentations are next. This style of learning may encourage stress management and multitasking. Above all, however, the quarter system teaches students to only learn content that will appear on the exam and to forget all “irrelevant” information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No question: the quarter system allows you to cover more topics in one academic year and if you are unhappy with your classes,  you only have to get through the 10 weeks. However, if you decide to go to college, you should be interested in the material you are studying or at least have a future career goal in mind that makes pushing through tough classes worthwhile. The purpose of studying at a university involves getting to know all different angles of a topic and then learning to argue on the basis of this knowledge. In general, the broad education of the quarter system lacks the depth of the knowledge gained in the semester system.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system teaches students to only learn content that will appear on the exam and to forget all “irrelevant” information.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one more specific aspect that I really like about the semester system: students are required to write long papers. Yes, you read that right — I want to write more than just the casual four pages, double-spaced. Speaking as an undergraduate student in the social sciences, I believe it is important to have the chance to write up to 20 pages about a scientific problem in your field. As a part of this journey, undergraduates should have the opportunity to explain and understand difficult material step-by-step, by writing not only summary papers but also argumentative ones with a theoretical background. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is also a time to develop your own views on the world. This process takes time and involves the opportunity to take wrong turns. Once students have stepped out of the university context into the real world, there will not be as much time to question one’s own view over and over — so why rush through university like it is a crash course? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter and semester systems have different goals. While the quarter system allows students to gain a broader view on many different topics and teaches them to work efficiently under high pressure, the semester system leaves more time to approach difficult material in-depth. Rather than rushing through many different subjects and only remembering a few parts, I would rather take the extra time to expand my knowledge and be able to think outside the box. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carla Wenzel encourages students of the quarter system to think beyond a surface level about what they are learning. </span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86367\" style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86367\" data-attachment-id=\"86367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/argument-in-the-office-quarter-vs-semester-system/semvqtr/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=650%2C704&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,704\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"semvQtr\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=231%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?fit=888%2C962&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/semvQtr-e1550688776654.png?resize=435%2C471\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"471\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The Quarter System Optimizes the College Experience</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Autumn Murphy</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB students love to hate the dreaded quarter system. Ten weeks, 12 units minimum and never enough time to soak in the information that you’re given. The quarter system does not fare well for people who aren’t on top of their game, as they slip through the cracks when midterms and assignments pile up. Even staff complain that there’s not enough time to know all of their students, and before we know it, the quarter is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from a community college, I have the benefit of having experienced both systems. The quarter system is superior because you’ll never get bored. Students have freedom to wiggle around with their majors, along with being able to take summer sessions to make up missed units during the year. It’s not uncommon to double major here, and some students even take on a double minor on top of that. When I first got here, I thought people were lying to me when they said they took on multiple majors, but I soon realized that this was possible when I was exposed to the amount of time the quarter system gives them. The quarter system gives us just that: freedom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted, it doesn’t give us time to relax at all, especially with midterms starting in week two, but as soon as you know it, the quarter’s over and you’re onto a new round of professors and TAs. If you hate a certain someone in your classes, whether it be a strict grader or a professor that can’t teach, you end up leaving them in less than three months, instead of spending almost half a year relying on them as you would on the semester system.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system gives us just that: freedom.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fail a class on the quarter system, it’s simply not as big of a deal as failing a class on the semester system. The quarter system gives students the ability to retake failed classes at any given time. It’s even apparent in the culture. If you failed a class at my community college, it would set you back almost an entire year, and other students would look at you as if you were a failure. Failing classes at UCSB is almost so commonplace that no one bats an eye at you if you do it because there’s always an opportunity to recover and it doesn’t necessarily make you look like a bad student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since most semester students only have eight semesters to complete college in four years, compared to having twelve quarters, it is crucial for them to map out a four-year plan in their first year. Students with time-consuming and research-intensive majors have to course-related decisions quickly, as changing majors can have significant setbacks. Unlike the semester-system schools, UCSB allows students to take classes they want to, whenever they want to, which may be a reason why we have so many students tacking on multiple majors and minors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing classes into such a short time frame may seem counterintuitive because of the perceived lack of depth, but it allows students to find their strengths and weaknesses early on. Community colleges may even be better off overall with the quarter system, as students there have even more freedom than UC students do, thanks to lower tuition costs and fewer specialized courses such as general ed classes. If all colleges had the quarter system, the transition from the semester to quarter system would potentially be less harsh, and students would be able to transfer out faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quarter system also allows students to study abroad without missing much school. As I am preparing to study abroad in Australia for next fall, I was astonished at the number of units I was receiving: a sheer 24 quarter units minimum. I was worried about missing time at UCSB as it will be my last fall quarter here. But as I thought about it more, a quarter is only 10 weeks and I won’t be missing that much — I.V. can only change so much while you’re away.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick scroll through the Urban Outfitters’ website initially yields nothing new: overpriced sparkly party frocks, BDG mom jeans and those ugly FILA sneakers for which I can’t bear to jump on the bandwagon. But suddenly I do a double take when I click on the ‘Wellness’ section and see a host of vibrators, dildos and other various sex toys placed innocuously underneath the ‘Self Love’ division. A look at the Free People website reveals the same, albeit more expensive, result. Owned by the same parent company, Anthropologie, this sudden movement of younger-skewed brands to start marketing sex toys to a strongly feminist, sexually liberated generation smells strongly of bullshit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex-positive feminism is nothing new — it has been a movement embedded within the feminist community since the early 1980s. However, it seems that late Millennial and early Generation X women were swayed by the heavy presence of pornography-friendly sites like Tumblr in adolescence, leading to a positive outlook toward sex — notably masturbation and an emphasis on female pleasure. These early steps of social media sex positivity have led to a wide variety of successful multiplatform sex-themed websites and podcasts, including </span><a href=\"https://killerandasweetthang.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killer and a Sweet Thang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys We F****d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOREible Decisions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: all outlets where female-centric, queer-friendly and “taboo” sex practices take center stage. The demographic for brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People experienced a social media-induced sexual awakening in the mid-2010s that led to the radical conclusion that hey — maybe female pleasure isn’t such a big taboo after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset, it seems great that mainstream companies like Urban Outfitters and Free People are jumping at the chance to support female sexuality. But after a closer examination, I am hesitant to buy into the free love narrative fed by a company in which only </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/01/urban-outfitters-board-women/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the executive board is comprised of women. Maybe I’m just jaded, but for some reason, I am reluctant to believe that a bunch of older men of the Urban Outfitters board are super on board with the narrative of women loudly and proudly owning their sexuality. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.

Free People has additionally been accused of </span><a href=\"https://www.today.com/style/free-people-accused-appropriating-native-american-culture-festival-line-t85821\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appropriating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Native American culture for festival lines. When major clothing companies don’t care about being socially, culturally or racially sensitive, why would they suddenly flip the script and support what has been a sexual taboo for generations? They’re simply just looking to turn a profit.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban’s long and arduous list of scandals in juxtaposition with its sudden jump to selling vibrators, lube, whips and other bedroom-related products reeks of performative wokeness. Why would a company so notoriously nonchalant about apologizing for wrongdoings care about anything beyond their brand’s profit? When searching for products concerning one of the most intimate facets of a woman’s life, it seems illogical and counterproductive to patronize a brand that values business over people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a whole host of feminist companies that have been in the business of supporting female sexuality long before big companies sought out to capitalize on the “trend” of female pleasure. </span><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Vibrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been a trailblazer in the industry, operating since 1977. </span><a href=\"https://www.babeland.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babeland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has been around since 1993, is wholeheartedly committed to sex education and community involvement.

Those in search of DIY orgasms would have to drive to a sex shop situated in a strip mall on the opposite side of town and peruse the aisles with eyes averted from the other customers, paying cash at the register to avoid a paper trail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, all that shame and secrecy has flown out the window. Just this past year, millions of fed-up women </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weaponized a single hashtag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rewrite the rules of a convoluted sexual landscape. Buzz words like “empowerment” and “sex-positivity” represent the current iteration of feminism to which millennials subscribe. The feminists of 2019 sport “Pussy Power” buttons on their backpacks. They skip brunch to attend women’s marches. They open up about their sexuality not only to their closest friends but to their Twitter feeds as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they shop for sex toys not in a dimly lit hole in the wall, but in the wide-open, colorful paradise of Urban Outfitters. Thanks to this mainstream retail outlet and its new collection of </span><a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/self-love-products\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“self-love” products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, female pleasure is just as accessible as a ’90s-inspired slip dress or a coffee table book of dad jokes. Featuring items such as bath bombs, “sex dust” (whatever that means) and emoji-shaped vibrators, the line advances an indulgent, pleasure-centered understanding of sexuality that “empowered” women are demanding in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though these products may not be direct political statements, their arrival in the midst of a feminist revolution is no coincidence. Urban Outfitters is just one name in a long list of companies that have capitalized on hot-button social issues in recent years. Through ad campaigns like Gillette’s “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Men Can Be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and Nike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomlpJREDzw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Kaepernick commercial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, brands have attempted to align themselves with the political sensibilities of their consumers. Many of these campaigns have received backlash from news and social media critics who believe corporations should not be hailed as trailblazers of activism for nominally supporting social causes in order to sell razors or basketball shorts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true that brands are profit-driven and don’t always follow their activist lip service with donations to causes or specific calls to action. These criticisms carry heavy weight at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with our country’s Machiavellian, profit-driven economic system. Among 18 to 29-year-olds — the demographic to which Urban Outfitters caters — </span><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approval ratings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of capitalism have plummeted by 23 percent in the past eight years.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as much as we hate the system, we must acknowledge that companies are meeting disillusioned shoppers in the middle by infusing a much-desired sense of meaning into the matrix of material consumption. According to a </span><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/championing-change-in-the-age-of-social-media/#Key-Findings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two-thirds of Americans believe it’s “important for brands to take public stands on social and political issues.” Right now, consumers are demanding more than just products; they hope to spend their hard-earned money on symbolic representations of their deeply held beliefs. Gillette no longer sells razors; they sell a positive and healthy form of masculinity. Nike no longer sells sneakers and basketball shorts; they sell a bold commitment to racial equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality. Yes, this statement is undoubtedly motivated by profit. But it is a statement nonetheless, and a positive one at that. The </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of masturbation are numerous; the activity is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality and improve body image, just to name a few. Unlike other controversial Urban Outfitters </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/09/15/urbans-kent-state-sweatshirt-and-7-other-controversial-clothes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that have profited off the shock value of things, like eating disorders and the Kent State shooting, sex toys are not harming anyone except conservative parents who don’t want their daughters to know what an orgasm feels like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a trendy brand like Urban Outfitters in 2019, delivering sexual pleasure to their female consumer base can only be seen as a savvy business decision. I would advise curious female readers to put aside their anxieties about capitalism for a few minutes, pull up the Urban Outfitters website and treat themselves to some much-needed self-love. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurel Rinehart thinks there’s nothing wrong with corporations getting on board with the trend of sex positivity.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Though attitudes towards tattoos have slowly shifted as the number of people getting inked increases, their acceptance in the workplace is still in question for managers and millennials seeking jobs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many, tattoos are nothing more than a meaningful memento or method of self-expression. But tattoos, regardless of their meaning or presentation, have been historically associated with low social class. This association, rooted in racial and cultural stereotypes, needs to be left in the past. In the modern American workplace, tattoos should not play a role in hiring decisions. Because the population of people with tattoos is growing, having workers with tattoos not only will foster an environment of acceptance for workers but for customers as well. Furthermore, if managers are limited to hiring people without tattoos, they could potentially limit their workforce.</span></p>\n<p>“My tattoo is really special to me,” said first year Emerson Stewart. “It reminds me of my family and what they have done for me.” Just below his right arm, over the crooks of his rib cage is a swallow. “It commemorates the boating trips where I learned to appreciate my family more, discovered a deep respect for the ocean, and grew a lot as a man.” Tattoos have become a form of expression and often serve as reminders of the places and people we love.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Both of my parents had tattoos and when I turned 18, my birthday present was my tattoo. Both of my sisters have multiple as well. In our family, our tattoos are symbolic of what’s important to us and what we value,” said third year Tayla Kelley. “I currently have six and each one has its own story that makes me who I am today. Whenever I see them, it’s a reminder to myself of what’s important to me and helps keep me grounded in a way. They’re reminders of everything I’ve been through and everything I’ve lost, but they remind me of what I still have as well.” It is these intricacies and the elusive beauty of tattoos like Kelley’s and Stewart’s that often evade the realm of consideration in the workplace.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it becoming more common for people to have sentimental tattoos, but it is also more common for people to have tattoos in general. According to a</span><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2008/12/09/tattooed-gen-nexters/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted by the Pew Research Center, more than 1 in 3 “Gen Nexters” or Americans ages 18-25 have expressed themselves in terms of appearance, tattoos being the most popular form. For any company, having a diverse, representative staff can improve business. However, to that end, some argue that having staff members who are heavily tattooed could decrease business because customers may have an inherent negative reaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also something to be said about a manager’s discretion in setting a dress code. Ideally, a manager has chosen a dress code that they feel is fitting for their business and the customers they will be serving. In terms of tattoos, there is the subjective questioning of obscenity and location. While I do believe there is more of a consensus on what is obscene or offensive, I believe there is less certainty in restricting the location of tattoos. Someone with a face tattoo that is not obscene may find it more difficult to be hired than someone else with a less visible tattoo such as one on the hand or wrist, and while I would venture to say that the average person bearing a face tattoo isn’t trying to get a job at your local haberdashery, it is important to question where the line should be drawn. For argument’s sake, I believe obscenity should be up to a manager’s discretion, while extreme locations such as the face or neck should be evaluated relative to other qualifications.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This association, rooted in racial and cultural stereotypes, needs to be left in the past. In the modern American workplace, tattoos should not play a role in hiring decisions. Because the population of people with tattoos is growing, having workers with tattoos not only will foster an environment of acceptance for workers but for customers as well.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a final point, hiring managers who discriminate against job candidates with tattoos may be settling for a less-qualified pool of applicants. Because there is a growing population of people with tattoos among the younger generation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in fact, 1 in 3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a manager who will only consider applicants without tattoos is decreasing the pool of candidates by more than 30 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality of tattoos in the workplace is that although there is a movement towards more acceptance, body adornments can inevitably play a role in hiring decisions because it is ultimately at the manager’s discretion whether or not they will hire someone with tattoos. Because restricting tattoos can limit the potential of a workforce, and the number of people with tattoos in America has significantly increased, I argue that we re-evaluate the culture and judgements of tattoos. We are now in a time where we can foster an environment that allows for a reclamation of this form of self-expression.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryana Kamelian wants you to rethink your initial impressions of tattooed workers.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86055\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86055\" data-attachment-id=\"86055\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/tattoo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=2500%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tattoo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?fit=800%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86055\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo-195x250.png?resize=269%2C345\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=768%2C983&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?resize=800%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tattoo.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86055\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makena Sumi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many things about tattoos that I love. I love that they are a way of learning things about the people who are in possession of them, that they are a beautiful form of artwork and, most of all, that they provide a means of taking ownership of your own body. However, there are valid reasons why visible body art is considered inappropriate in a professional work setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that tattoos can present ideas or symbols that are offensive to others. Though it’s probably safe to say that my blue butterfly tattoo won’t offend anyone I might encounter in the workplace, it can’t be guaranteed that every tattoo is not an offensive statement or symbol. Because of this, it is probably best to limit tattoos in the work setting altogether rather than single people out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One extreme example would be a swastika tattooed on someone’s arm. While freedom of speech protects this person’s right to have this tattoo, I think we can all agree that this symbol is very offensive to others and is not an image that most companies want greeting a person when they are, say, grabbing their morning coffee. While most tattoos do not depict images that are so blatantly socially unacceptable as this one, there are many subtle images that can cause a client to feel uncomfortable when approaching a worker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I don’t desire to be judged by those around me based on their perceptions of my tattoos. Countless studies indicate that first impressions have a lasting effect on relationships. I wouldn’t want a coworker or client making decisions about who I am as a person based on a piece of artwork. I would rather represent myself through my actions and words than through a tattoo. In the end, no one but you knows the true meaning of the images on your body, and while you might not mean to insult anyone with your tattoo, its meaning might be very easily misconstrued.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as visible tattoos have become more commonplace and diminishingly associated with low-brow culture, the image of a tatted body might clash with the desired appearance of the company. Considering that employers are paying workers to represent their companies, it is not too much to ask that workers display the sort of image that employers desire.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along these lines, studies indicate that although showing body art has become a common trend, the presence of tattoos continues to be a limiting factor in the hiring process. A 2014 </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0950017014528402\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> determined that hiring managers are still concerned about how visible tattoos will affect a client’s opinion of an employee. Additionally, a 2015 </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698915301247?via%3Dihub\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed that clients still tend to have an aversion to front-of-house employees with tattoos. There is a very simple solution to this issue — get your tattoos done on your torso or thigh instead of your arm, and having art on your body becomes a nonissue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as it has become more mainstream to sport visible tattoos, the law has always backed an employer’s right to enforce rules concerning the presence of tattoos. In many cases, employees have cited anti-discrimination and freedom of speech in cases attempting to fight employer’s policies. However, the courts have maintained that it is an employer’s right to determine policy regarding the presence of body art. Employers reserve the right to control the image of their companies, which includes whether or not their workers show tattoos. Even as visible tattoos have become more commonplace and diminishingly associated with low-brow culture, the image of a tatted body might clash with the desired appearance of the company. Considering that employers are paying workers to represent their companies, it is not too much to ask that workers display the sort of image that employers desire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is important to acknowledge that as tattoos become more prominent in popular culture, their presence tends to be associated less with the outlandish counterculture they once represented, especially among the younger audience. Also, it is not fair to assume that every tattoo is a statement that might offend someone. Many tattoos are beautiful pieces of artwork, names, dates or statements that have sentimental value to their owners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given this information, the presence of tattoos in the workplace should be up to the discretion of the staff supervisor. Taking all this into account, it is important to consider the consequences a tattoo might have on your desired career before heading to the tattoo parlor. </span></p>\n<p><em>Melanie Ziment wants people to think twice before getting inked. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/argument-in-the-office-tattoos-in-the-workplace/","id":5613,"author":{"id":367,"name":"Aryana Kamelian"},"related":[5612,5611,5610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Argument in the Office: The Merits of Read Receipts","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Argument in the Office","publish_date":"2019-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opinion writers Ally McCulloch and Simon Ahrens face off on the societal value of read receipts. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has undoubtedly changed how we communicate for the better. We now have the power to reach people on the other side of the world and learn about current events almost instantly. We use texting and social media to keep in contact with acquaintances and loved ones. We send kissy-face emojis to show affection and write happy birthday on our friends’ timelines. I live hundreds of miles away from my best friends and family members, yet I feel as close to them as ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, texting and the like has also created a dimension of communication that has never existed before — a type of communication that doesn’t require any words at all. Apple has dominated the electronic world for years now. Almost every single person we know owns one an Apple phone (unless you’re a fringe Android user). Centered at the forefront of modern communication, Apple was the first to create an option to show if the person you are texting has read your message. Now, apps like Facebook and Instagram have followed this trend and automatically use read receipts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is ridiculous, I know I am not the only one who gets extremely butthurt, for lack of a better word, when I see someone has read my message and chosen to not respond. My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me? I thought we were close but I guess not…. It’s as if a switch in my mind has been turned on and I frantically worry my relationship with this person is now suddenly different. Usually, the next time I see him or her I will realize that I was over-exaggerating and that switch will be turned right back off. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mysteriousness of not knowing whether someone has just skipped over your text on accident or is purposefully ignoring you is beautiful in my eyes.

I will read someone’s message and absorb all of the information, then completely forget to respond until five days later. Sometimes, I don’t respond on purpose. I simply just don’t have anything to say in response or get overwhelmed by the constant need to be connected with others. I want to sit with my thoughts for a couple days, or even hours, and respond when I am ready. Hypocritically, when I do this, of course it is harmless or a simple mistake. But then others do the same, I want to curl up in my room and never come out.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong?

We’ve all received a “k.” response or interpreted a message with ten exclamation marks as overbearing and off-putting. It has been found that </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2012/02/01/people-are-more-likely-to-lie-through-text-messages-study-finds/37388961/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people are much more likely to lie through text versus talking face-to-face or an audio or video chat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The problem is that emotions cannot be interpreted as effectively without observing facial expressions and verbal tones. Read receipts reinforce this ambiguity when they leave the sender questioning what went wrong. Life was less complicated when people were forced to communicate face-to-face. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, let’s all agree that technology is confusing enough and leave read receipts behind.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally McCulloch encourages everyone to stop obsessing over read receipts. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85873\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85873\" data-attachment-id=\"85873\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/argument-in-the-office-the-merits-of-read-receipts/img_4696/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4696\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85873\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696-250x250.jpg?resize=396%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read receipts on messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp or Facebook have become a contentious topic among users since day one. While many of my friends voice their contempt for this whole level of passive aggressive messaging, I have always appreciated the credible information of the read receipt option whether that is proof for my friend’s ignorance or the clear message of my brother’s disinterest. And let’s be honest, feeding our relationship mind games, our inner control demons just want to know whether someone has read our messages or ditched us again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a private chat, my experience is that read receipts also positively impact conversation flows and response time. Once you have opened a message your partner is notified, so you are nudged into responding instantly. Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. And it is even more effective than not replying without the function. You can now avoid uncomfortable rejections or half-hearted conversations by signalling apparent disinterest without utilizing the power of words. It is essentially the straightforward way of finally “telling” your stalking admirer to bugger off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from facilitating the inconvenient task of giving someone the brush-off, I am convinced that read receipts convey a deep feeling of community and connection. Most people underestimate the reliability in planning and the lack of the feeling of insecurity provided by the function. This applies not only to meeting your date but also in group messages when you spontaneously decide to move your party from your friend’s house to Bill’s Bus on a Thursday night. Also, who has not experienced the beauty of immediate bonding when you text someone for the first time and you see they have the read receipt function as well? I kid you not, it is just mind-blowing to feel this deep connection of living life on the same page with your fellow iPhone buddies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want technology in general and the read receipt function in particular to control your deepest fears, you can either go on a life changing phone detox or choose options to read messages without triggering the read receipt. But let’s face it, the detox is probably just one of many new year’s resolutions we won’t fulfil this year so let’s stick to alternatives that include keeping our instruments of sin in our pockets.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we are a student newspaper dedicated to improving student communication for overall happiness and love I would like to end by offering some exclusive sneaky alternatives to circumvent read receipts for y’all: First, the screen pull-down technique allows you to read texts without triggering receipts so you are not pressured to reply at all and your conversation partners are for once not crying themselves to sleep. For our bougie Tim Cook supporters, a.k.a. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owners of an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus: You guys can use the new Peek feature to view your screen without triggering the function.

Featuring pounding drums and electric guitar, “Change” is an anthem about history repeating itself, tearing down walls and imminent revolution. Its message seems overtly political, especially considering the timing of its release — November 2008. Yet at no point in the song does Taylor speak to any specific issues. When subsequently asked about her political leanings, she replied, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not going to sit here and go into my political views, because that’s not what I chose to do. I chose to do music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next decade, Swift remained tight-lipped about politics. But in the Trump era, in which the nation is increasingly divided along partisan lines, silence is no longer acceptable. Celebrities have faced mounting pressure to openly pledge their allegiance to red or blue. Thus, Taylor Swift found herself trapped in a catch-22. If she kept quiet, people would accuse her of being a closeted Republican. If she spoke out, people would denounce her for using politics to bolster her image or criticize her for stepping outside her role as an entertainer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Sunday, Swift decided to go with the latter. In an impassioned Instagram post, she endorsed Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee and implored her followers to head to the polls on Nov. 6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before I go any further, I want to make something clear: Celebrities are hardly ever qualified to speak with authority on political issues. And yet, their influence cannot be overstated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 112 million followers, Taylor Swift is currently the seventh most followed person on Instagram. Her “vote” post received nearly three million likes. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vote.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that in the 24 hours after she posted, there was a significant spike in voter registration in both Tennessee and nationwide — almost half a million people in total. In one day, more people registered to vote in Tennessee than they did for nearly the entire month of September.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If celebrities care about their fans at all — especially those who face systemic oppression — they should urge people to vote.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A celebrity’s massive influence presents an opportunity to make a real difference. People ought to use whatever means they have at their disposal to promote civic engagement. Average citizens can do their part by volunteering to knock on doors in their neighborhoods; celebrities can do theirs by reaching out to people across the country via social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voter registration is one of the most responsible ways a celebrity can utilize their power. It’s a far more ethical alternative to selling sponsored products or sheer self-promotion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swift and other newly active celebrities have received backlash for exactly that: exploiting politics to boost their reputations. Her detractors deemed her endorsement of democratic candidates an act of “performative wokeness.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if a person donates a million dollars to cancer research just to impress their friends, they still donated a million dollars to cancer research. In other words: Even if a celebrity’s motive for promoting political engagement is superficial, does it matter?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s look at the bigger picture: Taylor Swift has mobilized over 500,000 people to hit the polls. Whether or not they vote for the people she endorsed, they will still vote, and that is what matters most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those still opposed to celebrity involvement in politics, consider the alternative. The decision to stay silent is a total waste of a unique position. By choosing silence, celebrities put themselves on the side of everyone who refuses to watch the news because “it depresses them.” The ability to turn off the TV is an immense privilege. Meanwhile, marginalized people, who stand a lot to gain or lose from the upcoming election, can’t afford to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pay attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If celebrities care about their fans at all — especially those who face systemic oppression — they should urge people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten years ago, Swift’s refusal to comment on politics was less consequential. This November, the stakes are higher than ever. Simply telling people to register, regardless of their views, is critical. While Taylor Swift will not solely determine this election’s outcome, her choice to post can make a greater impact than you or I can on our own. If she inspires her fans to vote for the “change” her song calls for, so be it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harper Lambert wants celebrities to use their power responsibly.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84437\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84437\" data-attachment-id=\"84437\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/argument-in-the-office-are-celebrities-obligated-to-speak-now-on-politics/img_1483/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=2048%2C1467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_1483\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?fit=888%2C637&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84437\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=888%2C636\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=768%2C550&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?resize=1024%2C734&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1483.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Celebrities Should Stay in Hollywood</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Laurel Rinehart</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think of Taylor Swift, my mind automatically goes back to a simpler and more optimistic time: 2009. With her cowboy boots and signature ringlet curls, her appearance is something my friends and I have always tried to emulate at school dances. Taylor Swift’s music became the soundtrack of our lives at the height of our middle school years. Before Instagram made me question my self-worth and the news cycle made me question the stability of democratic values, her wholesome lyrics and music videos constituted a large portion of my media consumption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the social and political landscape has morphed into something surreal and chaotic, and the media landscape has evolved in a similar fashion. Rather than allowing people to escape political issues, Twitter and Instagram force users to confront them head-on. Celebrities and laypeople alike participate in this often convoluted arena of discourse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of a few weeks ago, the formerly apolitical Taylor Swift is no exception. To some Americans, her Instagram post advocating for liberal causes and encouraging Tennessee residents to vote for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections seems like a step in the right direction. If celebrities have the ability to spread positive messages to a large audience of followers, why not take advantage of the opportunity? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On an individual level, Taylor Swift’s Instagram post can be seen as a positive phenomenon because she encouraged civic participation. However, her fans’ overwhelming response illustrates an alarming precedent regarding the power of celebrities, especially ones uneducated in the realm of politics, to influence the behavior of huge groups of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media sites have unchecked power to shape public opinion on a mass scale. Instagram, Swift’s platform of choice for posting this political message, has one billion monthly users — many of whom are young and impressionable. And these individuals aren’t just visiting social apps for escapist entertainment; a 2017 Pew Research poll found that 67 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large number of people getting their information from unregulated social media content has proven to have devastating consequences. Preceding the 2016 presidential election, a Russian firm published a series of inflammatory posts and ads intended to dissuade Democrats from voting for Hillary Clinton, reaching an estimated 150 million people in total. It is impossible to know for sure whether the results of the election would have differed if this content had not been disseminated, but it is clear that nowadays anyone can deliver information to the masses with ease. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers have a responsibility to understand the power they have and to refrain from misleading their followers.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if this political campaign had been delivered by a celebrity with a scope of influence akin to that of Taylor Swift. Celebrities manage to sell worthless products on social media due to their large following and the extent to which they are idolized by their fans, and a political message would likely have a similar effect. Though Taylor Swift’s message dramatically boosted voter registration — a positive effect in a political system whose function depends on civic participation — there is no way of ensuring that every celebrity’s call to action will be ethical or well-informed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expressing “woke” opinions on social media is now a trend that many people follow to prove they are informed and engaged during an extremely political era. However, celebrities are not always qualified to provide factually accurate information that serves as a basis for Americans’ political decisions. It’s not inherently problematic for prominent figures to engage in political discourse; however, it is alarming to think that citizens may view these posts as fact without researching the issues further on more reputable platforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decade ago, the stakes for political involvement were not nearly as high as they are now. We belted out the lyrics to “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story” without giving a single thought to the political leanings of their creator because, at the time, politics belonged in the realm of politicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, everything seems to have a political slant, and people are looking to their favorite influencers for guidance on how to view the world. These influencers have a responsibility to understand the power they have and to refrain from misleading their followers. If that responsibility is not met, the consequences could be significant.

This power comes from a certain level of vulnerability that is mutually accepted throughout the development of a relationship. When we love one another or open ourselves up, exposing and addressing our flaws and concerns or intimate details of our lives, we are giving another person the opportunity to hurt us and simply trusting they won’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheating or infidelity is an act of betrayal that often breaks the trust that a healthy, growing relationship necessitates. While cheating may not mean our partner has lost all previously possessed feelings for us, I urge us to stray from the normalizing and acceptance of cheating not only because it is a behavior that is disrespectful and hurtful amongst other things, but more so because it is an act that can easily be avoided with a little respect and communication.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are fueled by love and desire throughout our relationships and in all relationships; it is important for each person to be open and honest not only with their partners but with themselves about these factors. Psychotherapist Esther Perel, known for her work with erotic intelligence, emphasizes the distinction between love and desire by explaining, “if there is a verb… that comes with love, it is ‘to have.’ And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ‘to want.’ In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance… We want closeness. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we’ve already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with… In desire, we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words… fire needs air. Desire needs space.”’ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that point, there may be many factors that lead someone to cheat on or betray their partner. Often when someone has been cheated on their first reaction is to assume their partner no longer loves them or has the feelings they previously did for them. Many people ask themselves why they weren’t enough and begin to question every aspect of themselves depending on the level of intimacy and closeness of the relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While it is easier to fall into the pattern of these assumptions, these thoughts can often put us in a worse position than if we look at the situation objectively. Because a partner cheated does not necessarily mean they have lost all of the feelings that were previously held. However, this important acknowledgment does not justify infidelity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For what it’s worth, I have in fact been cheated on, and while the cheating didn’t initially end my six-year relationship, I felt the situation and the pain as a result of the situation could have been avoided had my boyfriend at the time addressed with me that he no longer wanted to be in a committed relationship. The words, at first, are hard to get out, but for someone who truly cares about their partner, no matter the level of intimacy, they must acknowledge how their partner would feel if they cheated on them instead of addressing the situation and know that not speaking up will result in a worse outcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that addressing your desires will free your partner of all pain as a byproduct of the relationship. Chances are, if you are ending a relationship to pursue another, your partner will be hurt, but there are feelings of closure that come with a discussion that do not come with betrayal. Betrayal is a disregard of a partner’s feelings. A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this issue comes from the change in what conventional relationships are. What is considered “acceptable” today? Millennials are perpetually in limbo, grappling between what feels right and what has been established as right. In a relationship, it is okay to want what you want, but you must be able to acknowledge that a relationship takes two; you have to communicate and be clear while also taking into consideration what your partner wants as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more and more millennials are transitioning away from marriage, so-called “unconventional” relationships are becoming a norm. It is okay to have an open relationship. It is okay to be friends with benefits or casually date, but it is not okay to commit to someone and act differently before having a conversation. Not talking is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think we should normalize cheating but normalize other types of relationships as long as the people involved are 100 percent aware of what the relationship is. We need to hold ourselves, our friends, our peers and our loved ones accountable. It is not that difficult to avoid cheating and the more we make excuses for one another the more likely it is for this behavior to continue.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana Kamelian implores individuals to consider the serious negative consequences that can result from infidelity.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cheating Isn’t So Bad</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83702\" style=\"width: 382px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83702\" data-attachment-id=\"83702\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/image_123986672-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"372,277\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83702\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=372%2C277\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll start with a disclaimer: I have never cheated on someone nor do I hope to. I don’t think cheating on someone is something you should try to do, but I want to suggest with this article that cheating is not something that makes you a bad person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider polyamorous people (those in more-than-two-people relationships of various configurations) because they have an interesting view on the issue. Not to generalize, but within the polyamorous community, there is something known as “compersion.” Compersion is that good feeling you get when your partner has happy romantic feelings about someone else. The response to one’s partner saying “I slept with someone else today!” is “good for you!” Ridiculous, right?! Obviously, you should be unhappy about it, and you should make the person you supposedly love feel bad for having sex with someone else. S/he did betray you, after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, doesn’t that sound familiar? Do scarlet letters, witch burnings and slut-shaming ring the same bells? They should. They are founded on the same unpleasant feelings. I ask that if you ever find yourself having those feelings, and you start to think of cheaters as a lower class of people, as less than moral, less than good, you’ll let your thoughts roll over those periods in history when adulterers were executed. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ask that you think about the more than several countries that to this day designate death as legal punishment for adultery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And maybe you’ll think about what some people like to do to others they find to be less than moral, less than good. I’m not being hyperbolic. I’m just saying that these sentiments, when mixed with power, do great evil—much greater evil than two people having consensual sex ever did—so they shouldn’t be fed or entertained. They shouldn’t be given credence.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone cheats on you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t love you. At the very least, it means they wanted to have sex, and someone else was there for them that wanted to have sex too. It could absolutely mean more, and I think that’s something that you, as a couple, should figure out. Talk. Be there for each other. And if you can’t do that, you should probably break up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more often than not, cheating in a relationship is a symptom rather than the disease. There is something making that person look elsewhere. Whether that be for love, some type of connection or even an escape, the relationship should address it or risk becoming volatile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life. It doesn’t work like that. Love doesn’t work like that. Love isn’t a decision made in a single instant; it’s a continuous effort. Intimacy takes work. If you’re in a relationship, you should be open about those feelings and desires. Whether they be yours or your partner’s, pretending they don’t exist is a form of cruelty. Hearts can break in silence. Resentment can fester. Then, one day, the love you had seems to blow up. And it seems to be gone in a single instant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that cheating hurts people. I understand that it leaves people feeling betrayed and disposable, that it makes people feel like garbage. And I think that’s terrible. It’s terrible that people come out of unfaithful relationships with years of trust issues and residual pain, and I think the blame for that rests on all of our shoulders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is all of our responsibility to talk about cheating without stigmatizing any group of people, cheat-ers or cheat-ees. We should recognize that jealousy comes from a selfish and possessive place, and we should remember that sex is (fairly) universal. Everyone may find themselves attracted to someone besides the one they’re already involved with, but that doesn’t mean that the love you already have is reduced in any way. We should have more realistic expectations of ourselves and the ones we love. No one’s self-worth should rely on the faithfulness of any one person because faithfulness does not equate to love.

So do you, right? You might have walked past quite a few dogs on your way to class, even stopped for a moment to pet one of them. Maybe you have a puppy at home or your house is filled with cats or you have a rabbit that you just absolutely adore. Me? I have two dogs, a chinchilla and three birds back at home, and I can say with certainty that I love them all. Every six in ten Americans has a pet. Why do so many people turn to animals for companionship? Well, we aren’t as different from animals as we think.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all seek happiness. We all do our best to avoid pain. Have you ever accidentally stepped on your dog’s paw and then felt like the most loathsome human imaginable?

Dogs, like humans — like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animals — experience love and happiness, loneliness and fear, pain and suffering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, every year, over 70 billion animals are raised and slaughtered in ways that would bring any human being with an ounce of compassion in their soul to tears.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On factory farms, cows, pigs and chickens are crammed into filthy feedlots and injected with hormones, stimulants and antibiotics. Many of these animals are fed “renders,” which can range anywhere from dead and ground up cows to diseased animals, roadkill and euthanized pets instead of proper meals.  They live out their short lives bloodied, battered, breathing in toxic fumes, covered in sores and unable to move an inch, until they finally wind up as the ground beef for your Tuesday night tacos or the chicken nuggets you just ate for lunch. When I was younger, my family and I had the urge to save a hummingbird from dying outside in the cold, while also continuing to eat chicken for dinner. Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others? We are conditioned at a young age to believe that cows, pigs, chickens, sheep and fish are somehow lesser than the dogs, cats, bunnies and horses that we love so dearly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ignorance, apathy and hypocrisy of humans all sustain this unsustainable lifestyle of factory farming. In addition to the ethical immorality, consuming animals also has drastic ramifications for our planet. While 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions is due to transportation, including road, rail, air and marine, a whopping 51 percent is due to breeding livestock and their byproducts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, carpooling instead of driving solo, biking to and from work and even cutting down driving won’t be enough to save us, although doing all of these are still beneficial. In the United States, 55 percent of our water use goes toward animal agriculture, whereas five percent of water use is domestic or used for drinking, showering, washing dishes, etc. Consequently, shortening our showers and fixing leaky plumbing only saves a drop or two in the bucket. As if the effects of this industry weren’t already concerning enough, every minute, the animals bred for food produce seven million pounds of excrement. Lovely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with these facts, you still might remain apathetic to the detrimental effects animal agriculture has on the environment — it’s not like we only have one life-sustaining planet or anything. Climate change, water use, deforestation, species extinction, fisheries, land use and waste — all of these are severely affected by animal agriculture, whether we want to acknowledge our harsh reality or not. Every second, animals die and the earth pays for our ignorance, delusion and indifference. With billions of us consuming meat daily, the implications are frightening. Every day, we hear snippets of the environmental disaster surrounding us: Species of animals and plants are rapidly becoming extinct.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of ocean dead zones is increasing. Every day, we have the choice to turn a blind eye or to do something. The excuse, “I’m just one person. What difference can I make?” just won’t cut it anymore. When the production of one hamburger patty requires 660 gallons of water — the equivalent of showering for two months — the impact each individual person has is huge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is hope. An entirely plant-based diet reduces your carbon footprint by 50 percent, but even consciously making the effort to reduce our meat intake makes a substantial difference. Although the ultimate, sustainable goal would be for everyone to become vegan, I’m taking baby steps. By removing animals from my menu, I’ve already come a long way from being the girl who posted a picture of her In-N-Out cheeseburger on Instagram a few years ago with the profound caption, “Wow” and the heart-eye emoji. After nearly a year and a half of being vegetarian, I can definitely say the change was worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. Start reducing the amount of animal products in your diet. Then, make the choice to remove them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having compassion for animals is better for the animals. It’s better for your body. It’s better for your soul. It’s better for the environment. Having compassion for animals is better for the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Calista Liu wants everyone to consider the ethical consequences of meat-eating.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Plant-Based Privilege: Why Veganism Needs a New Approach</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PETA.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published an article entitled “Top 10 Reasons to Go Vegan in the New Year.” Nestled between valid reasons like “save the planet” and “help feed the world” was this: “All the cool kids are doing it,” followed by a list of high-profile celebrities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name-dropping those who “regularly appear in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine” is usually a failsafe marketing strategy. When it comes to veganism, however, this method is counterproductive. It makes veganism seem pretentious, undermining its personal benefits and positive impact. Worse, it contributes to the misconception that this lifestyle is only for the wealthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, veganism is a privilege that not everyone can afford. Being able to subsist comfortably on an animal-free diet is only possible with sufficient time and money. Poor people are never included in conversations about going meatless and eating green. Those who say “anyone can go vegan” are turning a blind eye to classism, poverty and how the meat industry profits off of both.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason why going full herbivore is called “converting.” Most people find the transition difficult because their favorite foods contain butter, eggs or milk. Ingredients like soy, rice, almond and coconut are popular substitutes for the real thing. They make the switch not just tolerable, but enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re also significantly more expensive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writer Antonia Noori Farzan published an article about the cost of these alternative products. Over the course of a month, she compared the prices of her purchases to their non-vegan counterparts. In total, eating vegan costs her roughly $100 a month. If you’re a member of the middle class, that’s pricey. If you’re one of the 40 million Americans making minimum wage, that’s unthinkable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veganism, however, is about more than paying for food — it’s also about having the time to prepare it. Vegan or not, home-cooked meals are both labor- and time-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with meat and dairy substitutes (whose absence would “take the joy out of eating”), cooking made it easier for fellow Gaucho Lily Garcia-Daly to convert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really lucky to have a family that supported my lifestyle change. Not everyone has a mom who would buy them almond milk in addition to normal milk for the rest of the fam[sic]. Not only did she encourage me to make my own meals, but she also made plant-based meals for my non-vegan family,” Garcia-Daly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet. Some parents work multiple jobs or round-the-clock shifts to support their families. This leaves little time for stewing lentils or grilling tofu burgers. Even if cost wasn’t an issue, there’s no vegan equivalent of McDonald’s or KFC. Vegan options at fast food establishments are nonexistent, unless you count french fries. Even so, fast food is unhealthy and unsustainably grown, fundamentally clashing with vegan values.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, fast food is the only option for those living in extreme poverty. While they aren’t America’s largest consumers of fast food, poor people are preyed upon by the industry more than other members of society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the result of “food deserts,” which the fast food industry helped to create. Food deserts are low-income neighborhoods in which healthy and affordable food is scarce. In these same neighborhoods, Wendy’s and Taco Bells flourish on every corner. The multi-billion-dollar meat, agriculture and fast food industries collude to make their products cheap and easily accessible. As a result, obesity is rising in low-income areas and has surpassed smoking as a leading cause of death. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These industries work together to trap the marginalized in a vicious cycle of poverty. The fast food industry is one of the most unequal industries in the U.S. While their CEOs are among the highest paid, their employees are by far the lowest paid. The meat and agriculture industries pocket an enormous profit from overworking and underpaying their employees. Many of these laborers are undocumented immigrants with no other employment opportunities. Fast food corporations profit as well, exploiting their workers and selling their labor back to them in the form of hamburgers and chicken nuggets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these industries have the lower class right where they want it: on both sides of the counter. There is no place for veganism in the struggle to survive on minimum wage. It’s not even a topic of conversation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, claiming that veganism is universally accessible is ignorant. Preaching that veganism is morally superior is similarly inconsiderate. The implication that anyone who doesn’t convert doesn’t care about the earth vilifies the underprivileged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More importantly, it distracts people from the task at hand: finding solutions. The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong. Budget, schedule and family size also need to be taken into consideration. Veganism’s mission goes beyond winning over individuals — it involves tackling the intertwined injustices of the immigration system, poverty and the meat industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than imposing judgment, advocates of veganism should focus on education and activism. There are also smaller-scale fixes. Vegans can encourage people to cut down on food waste and meat consumption, buy locally if they can afford it and teach people how to do their best with limited resources. The food industries may be rich and powerful, but there are still opportunities to affect change through individual action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, a plant-based diet is doable for most Americans. Protein sources like meat and dairy can be swapped out for beans, nuts and grains without additional cost. But to realize the vision of a sustainable food economy, veganism must be presented as more accessible and less elite.

Every Jan. 1, we set goals for ourselves to get into better shape, try new things or anything else that we feel the need to work on. The idea is inherently positive when it’s done correctly. We all wish to become the best version of ourselves, and the New Year presents an opportunity to do so. This “20-SlateClean,” I want to convince you all to commit to a resolution because now is the best opportunity to accomplish something you’ve always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of writing down and sticking to a resolution can be extremely positive. For example, I have made a resolution to get out of my comfort zone more often, and already I’ve experienced more in two weeks than I have all last quarter. At its core, a New Year’s resolution is a break from the norm; you are doing something that you have wanted to do but did not in the year that has passed. If you are doing the same thing every day, you have a tendency to blend each one together into one memory. A break from the routine, such as socializing more or exploring new places, will make more memories and make life more interesting. People always say that life is short but there is no reason that life should also be boring. There may be hiccups along the way, like losing your keys on a night out or not progressing as quickly as you’d like with your fitness; however, when you finally see progress on your resolution, it will be that much sweeter.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll have the potential to make new friends, see new places and feel better about the person you’ve become.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When critics say resolutions are more harmful than beneficial, it is not telling the entire story. Sticking to a resolution that is focused on personal growth is one of the best things you can do for yourself. A resolution born out of societal pressure, however, will be much more painful and negative. For example, wanting to lose weight because your body feels unhealthy is completely different from losing weight because you don’t see yourself as having the ideal body type. The point of a resolution is to be happier with who you are, and chasing goals that are set by someone else is not a healthy way to go about it. Another thing that is brought up is the fear of failure. You have to keep in mind that there is absolutely zero shame in failure. Trying to better yourself is not an easy thing to do, and it’s only natural that there are going to be a couple of nicks and bruises. Don’t feel discouraged or that you’ve wasted time just because you mess up once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you choose your New Year’s resolution correctly and stick with it, you’ll end up better off in 2018. You’ll have the potential to make new friends, see new places and feel better about the person you’ve become. At the very least, if you decide that your resolution wasn’t for you, it’s possible to pat yourself on the back for getting out there and trying something new. After the shit-show that was 2017, you owe it to yourself to get some happiness.</span></p>\n<p><em>Ali Abouesh wants people to work on things they don’t like to gain new insights.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New Year, Same Fuckups</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another year, another ambitious list of goals to be forgotten about once the champagne bubbles settle. All of us have things we would like to change about ourselves: lose weight, drink less, study more, make money … the list goes on. It is important to reflect on your goals at any stage in the year, and New Year’s resolutions seem to benefit us by carving out a designated time for that reflection in the midst of life’s distractions. There is nothing wrong with making an effort to correct mistakes or start out the year on a positive note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite the optimistic promise of change in the new year, the implementation of resolutions ends up being problematic for most people. Part of this has to do with the way our culture quickly jumps from trend to trend, sacrificing lasting meaning for the newest beat. If someone is making a resolution on Jan. 1, chances are they are only doing it because resolutions are trending at that point in time and they are encouraged to follow the lead. Although the goals we set are meant to apply to the whole year, the excitement and motivation behind these goals quickly wear off once the designated time for resolutions has passed. In the modern day especially, people have short attention spans and are not willing to revisit an old goal over and over again after the hype has worn off. There is no point in participating in a tradition that involves committing to long-term goals when those goals are only valued during a short span of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem is that the popularity of New Year’s resolutions can make people feel pressured to take on resolutions that are unsustainable and potentially harmful. One of the most popular resolutions for people to commit to is weight loss, especially since it is common to gain weight during the holidays. This can lead to the popularization of trendy diets, such as Atkins or Whole30, which are extreme and unrealistic for the average person to suddenly take on. Advertisers know that consumers are especially susceptible to weight loss gimmicks during this time and can manipulate them to make unhealthy decisions in their quest for a new body.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the tradition of resolutions was formatted in a way that required action rather than merely intent of action, I would be much more likely to support it as a legitimate exercise.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the designation of Jan. 1 as a clean slate allows a convenient scapegoat for people to put off their goals. Holiday parties and family gatherings make December a time when most people are not focused on healthy eating, and the idea of the new year right around the corner only enables this behavior further. The structure of the holiday season encourages people to binge-eat all through December and then take unhealthy steps to lose that weight as soon as the clock strikes midnight for the first time in the new year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the tradition of resolutions was formatted in a way that required action rather than merely intent of action, I would be much more likely to support it as a legitimate exercise. The Jewish holiday Yom Kippur is an example of a tradition centered around self-improvement that involves more tangible steps toward the goal being discussed. It calls for reflection, repentance from one’s sins and the correction of any debt or wrongdoing incurred throughout the year. It is customary to make donations to charity and take other steps to repent for one’s sins during this holiday, using the time for action. Since there is no designated time for action during the new year, a list of goals is often the only thing accomplished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At their core, New Year’s resolutions are not actually about doing good, but about planning to do good. They enable us to craft popular social media posts announcing our goals, only to forget about those goals once the next item pops onto our feed. Although self-improvement is always excellent, don’t expect to attain it just because you wrote it down on Jan. 1.</span></p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart thinks there are better ways to improve yourself

400;\">Marijuana is just as much a hallmark of the UCSB experience as Freebird’s, surfing and bike accidents. As a beach town with a laid-back surfer vibe and beautiful weather conducive to outdoor activities, Isla Vista provides the perfect backdrop for a thriving stoner culture. Smoking provides the basis for many social rituals that UCSB students would consider memorable facets of college life, from nervously blowing smoke out the window of your freshman dorm room with your new friends to lighting up a bong with housemates in your I.V. apartment as an upperclassman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weed brings Gauchos together in a way that few other things can. If you meet a potential friend in a class or dorm hall, for example, inviting them to a smoke sesh is a designated way to transition your connection from acquaintances to buddies with a shared experience. There are recognized scripts and etiquette rules around smoking weed that make it an easy social field to navigate, where one is not constantly worried about doing or saying the right thing. At UCSB specifically, indoor spaces like privately rented apartments and outdoor spaces like the beach provide the ideal environment for stress-free seshing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its cultural significance, weed provides a relatively safe avenue for students to engage in “rebellion” as youth inevitably will in some form or another. The social contexts in which Gauchos blaze up together are relatively safe, mellow and welcoming. While alcohol is also a huge part of social life at UCSB, the parties where it is consumed are often loud and crowded, with fighting and sexual violence occurring all too frequently. I’m not saying that alcohol is the sole cause of these negative events, but there definitely is a correlation between them. Students coming together for a smoke sesh are far less likely to encounter dangerous or compromising situations than students heading out to a party on DP. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of negative health effects always looms over the head of any stoner attempting to sway the masses, and I’m not trying to deny that these effects exist. Reduced motivation and productivity, cognitive handicaps and potential long-term damage (though research on the latter is still mostly inconclusive) are all valid concerns.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a comparison of costs and benefits reveals that these risks are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. In my opinion, the new friendships and social rituals that weed culture facilitates at UCSB outweigh the potential dangers. Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits. As long as students use it as a social activity to relax after fulfilling their responsibilities for the day, there is no cause for alarm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos are situated in a unique point in life that is fully conducive to reaping the benefits of smoking weed. Adult responsibilities have not fully set in, we are surrounded by peers with whom we can engage in social smoking and we attend school in a beautiful, laid-back beach town. For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence. I would urge any student who is apprehensive of the dangers of smoking to cast those doubts aside and grab some friends, spark a joint and enjoy the exceptional stoner culture that I.V. has to offer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Laurel Rinehart wants UCSB to remain a stoner’s safe haven.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>CON: There’s More to Life Than Devil’s Lettuce</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is a pervasive part of the culture of Isla Vista, and it certainly has brought many positive experiences for UCSB students. Smoking a bowl after a hard midterm or a casual smoke sesh by the beach can be good destressors when done in moderation. That being said, there are certain problems that a culture like that can bring, and with the legalization of recreational marijuana on the horizon, these problems could end up becoming worse.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old stereotype of stoners being more prone to laziness while high does have some truth behind it. For every person who can smoke and do their work, there are three others who get high and put off their essays, studying and responsibilities. Being students at one of the top research universities in the country, we have a duty to maintain our reputation, and people who show up to class high or don’t do their schoolwork make us all look bad and ultimately lower the value of our degrees. If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next issue directly relates to the everyday consumption of marijuana. Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day. This is a moderation problem, which affects all areas of life, not just academics. I’ve heard of so many people who are avidly against driving drunk, but driving high is completely fine to them. Obviously this is hearsay evidence, but still, there’s definitely not the same stigma around driving high as there is around driving drunk. Both are extremely dangerous and can put others at risk. If you’re high every day, there will come a day when you have to drive somewhere, and since the stigma isn’t the same. you’re more likely to shrug it off and do so.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to consider about I.V.’s weed culture is that the very nature of the drug is beginning to change dramatically. Strains are getting more potent. Edibles are no longer hastily made by your stoner roommate but instead are professionally made into gummy bears, and rice krispy treats contain far more THC than they used to. “Dabbing,” or concentrated butane hash oil, has now become mainstream and is even available to use in nifty little vape pens that you occasionally see in Davidson during a late-night study grind. Weed is getting more potent, and it’s spreading everywhere. It is no longer confined to a late-night bong sesh in your apartment but can be consumed in the library, while casually walking the street in I.V. or while cruising through the Arbor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, if people want to light up, that’s their own prerogative and it’s their own life. The problems that are associated with marijuana all stem from a lack of moderate consumption, and if you’re capable of doing so then by all means go for it. However, we do have responsibilities as students of UCSB to be the best we can be academically. If it’s getting in the way of your grades, it’s time for a self-check on what’s important to you. The motto that we live by here is work hard, play hard, and you have to do one to earn the other.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Ali Abouesh hopes that people are careful with their doobies.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.
