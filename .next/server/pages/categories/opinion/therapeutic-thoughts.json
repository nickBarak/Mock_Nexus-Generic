Blasted across the Daily Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are articles stating that</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/for-many-access-to-mental-health-resources-starts-in-college/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is an ineffective resource</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/c-a-p-s-to-ask-students-to-maybe-try-to-be-happy-instead-of-sad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feels impossible to access</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Friends warn friends that C.A.P.S. is understaffed and underfunded. They inform each other that they may not be able to see a therapist for weeks and that some might not get an appointment at all. With the most “at-risk” cases — individuals with either severe mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts — prioritized, it can be difficult to secure a spot for others needing help. These issues cause students like Ace (whose name has been changed for their privacy), to ask if their problems are worth taking a space away from someone else “who might need it more.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rumors about underfunding </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appear to be close to the truth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, in recent years, C.A.P.S. has evolved to better assess student needs and match available care with available options. It is my opinion that although C.A.P.S. is doing its best to accommodate an ever-growing demand, the organization requires more funding, physical space and attention.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although C.A.P.S. is doing its best to accommodate an ever-growing demand, the organization requires more funding, physical space and attention.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before attending C.A.P.S., Ace had been suffering from depression for five years without professional help. While they were aware of student complaints, Ace wasn’t apprehensive to attend C.A.P.S because “therapy [would be] fucking difficult from all points of view” whether it be from the patient’s perspective or the clinician’s — or the student’s calendar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they felt that the quality of help they received was top tier, Ace could feel C.A.P.S.’s lack of funding “right away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On campus, there is approximately one C.A.P.S. psychologist for every 967 </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The organization is supported by student fees, an additional charge directly paid</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by every student independently of their tuition — making the difficulty to snag an appointment even more frustrating to some. </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As reported by the 2019-2020 UCSB breakdown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, $82.36 out of $1,820.70 of each student’s fall, winter and spring quarter service fees combined are dedicated to C.A.P.S.

Janet Osimo, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PsyD and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant clinical director at C.A.P.S., remarked over email, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand [for mental health care] is high not just at UCSB but at the majority of college counseling centers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taken over the course of thirty years, </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/87568225.2012.685852\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a national survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> released in “The Journal of College Student Psychotherapy” shows that college counseling centers have reported an increase in client pathology — the level of mental illness an individual experiences — along with an increase in the number of patients they treat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856718300571?via%3Dihub\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillipe Morite</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">r, PDH et al.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for the journal of the “American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that college has become a “capture point” for individuals with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as students enter university with their developing brains, counseling centers are integral to identify and prevent mental illnesses from progressing. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93567\" style=\"width: 443px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93567\" data-attachment-id=\"93567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/caps-infographic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?fit=819%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"819,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CAPS Infographic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?fit=100%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?fit=410%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93567\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?resize=433%2C1083\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"1083\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?w=819&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?resize=100%2C250&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?resize=410%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 410w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?resize=768%2C1920&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAPS-Infographic.png?resize=614%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 614w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-93567\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both papers mark the importance of college counseling centers in the lives of the students they serve and push for universities like ours to properly equip them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does C.A.P.S. measure up? Regarding wait times, Osimo shares that the period between a student’s Brief Assessment (BA) and appointment varies, with 46% waiting less than 7 days, 27% waiting between 8-14 days and 11% waiting between 18-21 days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C.A.P.S. BA system, wherein a student must drop in to be “assessed” by a C.A.P.S. intake personnel, has been in place for two years. It was developed with the hope that these quick check-ins would increase the number of people C.A.P.S. can help. After this mini-therapy meeting, students with sufficient need are assigned therapy appointments, while others are recommended student groups to attend. Osimo remarks that for the BA, 90% [of students] are seen in less than one hour, 32% of students … in less than 15 minutes. And 12% of students … [are seen in] 45-60 minutes.” But since the BA has to be conducted in person, it has proven to be another area where students find difficulty accessing C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessments are usually conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. Ace remarks that students who are juggling classes and jobs are “screwed” when it comes to matching their schedules to that of C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. closes at 4:30, “and so [during] the times you might be able to go and do one of those intake appointments, [such as] around dinner— [C.A.P.S. is] not there,” Ace said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Osimo acknowledges, “it doesn’t feel good to have to wait when we are dealing with an issue.” So, to try and combat student schedules, C.A.P.S. offers 20 peer group sessions where students come together and share their experiences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> LiveHealth, a new teletherapy service which accepts Student Health insurance, now collaborates with C.A.P.S. to connect students and therapists online (and unlike C.A.P.S and Acacia, does not have long wait times).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “We also know that not everyone needs the same thing,” Osimo continued. “Many students just need one appointment to discuss a specific goal rather than meeting multiple times for therapy.  We offer different options for different needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By acting within their budget, C.A.P.S. has attempted to help the largest amount of students possible — but as history shows they need more funding. C.A.P.S.’ lack of funding </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been an issue since 2006,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the Regents were presented with evidence of rising mental health issues in college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, from 2007-09 counseling programs across the UCs were granted a $12 million budget increase, achieved by raising student fees for two years (this was 28% of the initially requested $43 million dollars). They achieved decreasing the wait period for students to see a professional, but a rise in “the severity of student issues and greater demand for mental health services” continues to be a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in 2011, the University of California’s Office of the President applied for and received a $6.9 million student mental health grant funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA). Each campus was given $500,000, and the UC continued to receive CalMHSA until </span><a href=\"https://saccityexpress.com/gov-brown-vetoes-mental-health-bill-rejects-services-targeting-college-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former Governor Jerry Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vetoed it in 2016 and 2017 because the UC didn’t state an exact amount of money or a source for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2015, the UCs have been increasing student services fees by 5% to address the lack of therapists. Because of this decision, 80% of approved new positions “have been filed across the UC system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, issues like the UC’s inability to offer competitive salaries, recruit diverse talent and maintain consistent state funds have made it difficult to fill the remaining openings. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-2020 budget detail</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “additional funds are still needed [to hire more staff].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to work at places that are financially stable. So, to help our students, we need to provide more benefits for our staff.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their experience, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. does a good job of allocating its limited resources. By prioritizing people with serious mental health needs, Ace believes that even if a person is angry that they have been recommended to join a peer group rather than a one-on-one session, it’s important for students to understand that C.AP.S. is trying its best: “You got to trust in the expertise of the person sitting across from you … there’s a reason why they’re suggesting what they’re suggesting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace recalls that they used to convince themselves that they were fine because there were people out there in worse shape than them. “I sit here like, ‘Should I go to C.A.P.S.? No, I shouldn’t go to C.A.P.S. because I’m fine and I’ve never attempted suicide, I’ve only self-harmed a couple of times in my life.’ I’m really not ‘that big of a risk,’” they said, adding air quotes. “But in reality, people have told me several times now, it’s not really about being a big risk — it’s about preventing a big risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ace advises that even though it’s scary, students need to be honest to ensure that they receive proper treatment:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you go into C.A.P.S. and they’re like, ‘Have you experienced any suicidal thoughts?’ do I really want to answer this question, and then I have that moment of ‘should I lie? Should I just be like, “no, everything is fine, it’s all fine?”’ And the most important thing to do is to say [to yourself] ‘No, I’m answering this honestly’ … because at that point, if you start being honest with yourself, the person sitting across the table from you has an ‘oh, fuck’ moment and they then can understand your needs better.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time. Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one of the limitations of C.A.P.S., Ace found, is that their therapy only occurs once every other week and “that model does not work for a lot of people … which is why they try to push people into Acacia and into Santa Barbara [Behavioral Health] clinic … to get them into therapy sessions that are a bit more regular.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than being a place for long term one-on-one therapy, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. works best for those dealing with a mental health crisis. It allocates its resources to helping the most people possible, and the easiest way for them to do that is to act as a place of transition before recommending more long-term options for therapy. However, C.A.P.S.’ lack of traditional therapy is an issue at the heart of student dissatisfaction with the organization. With midterms, the quarter system and the increased likelihood of developing a mental illness in their early twenties, all students deserve the option to speak with a C.A.P.S. therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s solution to this problem is simple:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need more money. With the limited resources I don’t know what else they can do … keep putting more and more on them [and] you’re just going to crush them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s ideal for how C.A.P.S. should function involves more therapists, evening hours and the availability of weekly sessions for every student. “[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time,” Ace says. “Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ace and I are currently in C.A.P.S. therapy, I have many friends who have “given up” trying to get in. C.A.P.S. is on-campus, takes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student insurance and is a resource promised to us by the university. Demand for mental health care has risen, and while C.A.P.S. is doing its best to help everyone, they need more. Our campus needs more.

Ever since I was old enough to know what medicine was, I claimed becoming a doctor as my passion — it felt natural to me. So natural, in fact, that I selectively ignored just how boring I actually found the subject and how much trouble I had understanding it. I held onto this supposed passion of mine while entering college, where I decided I would pursue the pre-med path. Several chemistry classes and many mental breakdowns later, I realized there was nothing I dreaded more than spending the next decade of my life studying the natural sciences. I personally could not bring myself to care about studying them in the slightest. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I switched my major to psychology and communication, subjects that, don’t get me wrong, I find interesting and enjoy learning about, but I still wouldn’t call either of them my passion. I’ve struggled with the idea that something must be inherently wrong with me if I can’t find just one thing I could be passionate enough to devote my life to. Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay. It’s kind of a hard idea to come to terms with, but I’m becoming more comfortable with it. It always seemed like everyone around me had found their calling, but I’ve discovered that I’m actually far from alone in this struggle.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is allegedly the time when we should discover this one elusive passion, and I think this idea adds another unnecessary imperative to the list of things we, as students, need to be concerned about. Pressure is high during these years. The world, and us, wonder what we’re going to do with our lives. I find the idea that you need to, or should, spend your life following your “passion” unrealistic and limiting. It undermines everything that you pursue that isn’t done in the name of a passion, and the value of living without one. Your life can be complete and fulfilling without having that one particular thing that you’re living for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not often that a person is lucky enough to have always known exactly what they wanted to do with their life and that this interest is really as exciting and fulfilling as they expected. What I was passionate about when I was younger isn’t what I’m passionate about now, and what I’m passionate about now most likely won’t be what I’m passionate about many years in the future. There are things I’m passionate about, sure, but I can’t limit myself by saying that I have just one passion. I like to believe that having a passion is not a goal, or a life plan, or a major in college. It’s a feeling that can change given your circumstances and interests — a feeling that you can’t plan your life around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you can have a purposeful life without passion, by doing things that bring meaning to your life. You really don’t have to have, or eventually find, your one true passion and spend your life pursuing it. I think it’s completely okay not to have one at all. You might discover a passion eventually, or you might not, and frankly, it doesn’t matter either way. As long as you devote your time to endeavors that you believe are valuable, help others or bring happiness to your life, that’s just fine too. A life not dedicated to a strong interest is still a life worth living and one full of important contributions to society. Uncertainty is scary, and uncertainty about something as important as your direction in life is even scarier, but I think it’s okay not to know where you’re going. What matters is that you live in a way that’s important to you. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo is very passionate about not having a passion.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Veronica Vo</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Veronica Vo is an opinion staff writer and a second year psychology major.

Rather, I choose to think of 2019 as a year of accomplishing a lot academically, building my resume and gaining a newfound sense of confidence. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think back on it, I have changed a lot over the course of 2019. While I went into college with a certain sense of independence, I was still very naive. I pursued opportunities that made me happy instead of ones that I thought</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would look good on a resume, but I tended to question whether I was doing enough to prove my self-worth. The confident attitude I gained towards the beginning of 2019 was not crafted by a “New Year’s resolution” but an attitude I naturally developed in order to get what I wanted out of life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I, like the rest of the population, have personality traits I could “work” on in the new year, I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves. The new year should instead be looked at as an opportunity for self evaluation. Are the people in our lives and the academic endeavors we’re pursuing making us happy and excited for the future? If the answer is no, I think it is on us to make a change in the new year. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I ended this quarter feeling a little drained, like I was stuck in an endless routine. So for 2020, I plan to try new things that are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> geared towards success but towards general enjoyment. We should value our time in 2020 and maximize it towards its fullest potential. We should spend time making our own lives feel balanced, prioritizing our needs as well as the needs of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new year can also be looked at as an opportunity to be civically engaged by taking on work that affects the community in a positive way. Giving back strays from the typical New Year’s resolution that is geared directly towards personal growth, but it can still be an influencing factor in our futures. Getting involved in my student newspaper, helping educate elementary students about tree species and registering students to vote are all things I have been involved in this past year and have allowed me to contribute to my community as well as my sense of individuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the new year often involves meeting new people, having new experiences and forming new social circles. While this seems exciting, one thing I have learned in 2019 is to not leave your old friends behind. We can often get swept up in new romances, friends and groups that make us forget we need to make an active effort to reconnect with people who have been there when we’ve needed them in the past. I’ve reconnected with people I hadn’t talked to in a long time over winter break and am subsequently happier because of it. So reach out to your childhood best friend, old neighbor or extended family. Ultimately, it could affect both your life and theirs for the better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to popular belief, the new year does not necessarily need to be a period of change for everyone. Instead of thinking of the new year as a chance to kick a habit you’ll probably end up keeping, reexamine your daily routine and carve out more time for your own personal enjoyment and stability.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai thinks the new year is a good time for celebration, reflection and natural change rather than arbitrary resolutions. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

Every time I opened my laptop my stress levels rose, yet I couldn’t let them go — I couldn’t make myself close them. Each tab was a voice telling me that I needed to finish an assignment, apply for a job, check my email or figure out the bus schedule. My mind was constantly stimulated, and I lacked the time to enjoy what was in front of me because I was too focused on checking off boxes on my overcrowded to-do list. As I counted 23 different tabs opened on one of my webpages, I realized I needed to make a change. I felt trapped in a cycle of having to do everything but not having enough time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With deadlines coming up, new jobs and internships to apply to, an apartment to clean and plans to make with friends I hadn’t seen all summer, I began to reminisce about the summer days when I felt so much more focused, calm and balanced. I had time to sit and just <em>be</em> in the present moment. I didn’t check my email for days at a time and was rarely absorbed by external pressure and stress. Although this was just a month before, it seemed like a lifetime ago. With all of these newfound realizations and the overwhelming stress of being back in school, I decided I needed to reconnect with the summer version of myself and get to the root of why I, as well as many other college students, felt trapped in a counterproductive cycle.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I needed to take responsibility for my unhealthy, 23-tab mindset. I needed to exit out of everything and start over with myself. My head was full of due dates, ideas and goals — leaving my physical and mental health last on my priority list. I was guilty of spending the whole day constantly thinking and working without giving myself time to process or enjoy the moment. The day would fly by, and suddenly, it was 4:00 p.m. and I hadn’t eaten anything. I’d had spent hours reading, grocery shopping, checking my email and going to class, but hadn’t nourished my body or appreciated the sun shining on my face. Admitting that I wasn’t taking time out of my day for my own physical and mental well-being was the first step toward making a change in my habits.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A question I constantly ask myself is this: In a month or even a week from now, am I still going to care or worry about this minor problem or midterm coming up?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, I had to change my perspective on what really matters in the long run.

The best thing we can do for ourselves is to make sure our mind, body and spirit are in harmony in order to allow ourselves to thrive. If these entities are linked, we can succeed with more ease because our intentions and goals are clear instead of fogged by never-ending to-do lists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the privilege that comes with being stressed about school, internships, jobs and future opportunities must be recognized. To have the ability to worry about what career path I want to choose or what books I need to read is an undeniable privilege that </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/unesco-264-million-children-dont-go-to-school/a-41084932\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">millions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people don’t have. A gratuitous amount of people don’t have the opportunity to worry about these things because they can’t afford or don’t have the right to receive an education. When one’s only priority is to make sure their family has something to eat for dinner or to teach their kids how to read because they <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41558486\">lack the right to an </a></span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41558486\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">education</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is hard to justify your own reasons for stressing. This is not to say that a person’s stress about school and life is any less valid just because it is a privileged problem to have — it simply puts things in a different perspective. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admitting that I wasn’t taking time out of my day for my own physical and mental well-being was the first step toward making a change in my habits.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As tiresome and stressful as going to UC Santa Barbara can be at times, I love this school and feel like I am gaining valuable insights and life lessons here. The stereotypical “work hard, play hard” mentality has proven itself true in my experience of making sure I spent the whole day at the library so I could go out with my friends at night. The mix of academic rigor and fun is just as amazing as it is unique. As fairytale-like as this school can sometimes feel with the ocean and mountains at our fingertips, parties every day of the week and top-notch professors, it is important to make sure to take time for yourself and not let stressors like finding an internship or getting an A’s in all your classes consume you. Put things into perspective and try to focus on one thing at a time. Close those tabs and make time for yourself. Whether that is listening to music, taking a walk on the beach, cooking, meditating, getting lunch with a friend or whatever you need to do to destress and enjoy the moment, make sure you fit it into your daily schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you keep your eyes shut to the beautiful things that surround you every day, you will put yourself in a counteractive cycle of always being on the move and never making any time for yourself. Closing your tabs may not be the cure to the stress in your life, but it is the first step toward a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler wants you to close close the tabs on your computer screen and take time to destress from your daily routine.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/","id":6413,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[6412,6411,6410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Politics of A Good Night’s Sleep","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-06-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/alex-art-e1559949664540.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/alex-art-e1559949664540.png?resize=650%2C642&ssl=1","description":"Examining the social implications of sleep, Kian Karamdashti encourages readers to hit snooze.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kian, no!

To me, it has always felt like a waste of the scarce time we have to be alive. If the average human sleeps eight hours a night, in my mind, that means a third of one’s life is wasted not being present in the real world. When I was little, sleep meant less playtime. Now that I’m older, it means less productivity. So I have simply chosen to minimize my time in society’s nightly coma.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this refusal to submit to sleep might sound like a serious problem, I wore that tag as a badge of honor. I guess I was proud of evading rest by squeezing every bit of life out of my day through sheer determination. I never thought of myself as the smartest kid, but I was definitely one of the hardest workers. Got a whole chapter of chemistry to learn in one night but also want to hang out with my friends? Easy, I’ll pull the all-nighter, still make 6 a.m. practice and pull off a good grade, all in the span of 12 hours. This feat became almost a weekly routine; I liked being the kid that got everything done. I liked being reliable enough to take care of things. I liked not missing a moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in my attempt to maximize the time I spent awake, I was actually hindering my quality of life by choosing not to rest. As I progressed through my late teenage years, I found myself coming down with the sniffles more and more, constantly forgetting things and not feeling present as I zombie’d through the days. All of these symptoms, alongside my sleep habits’ correlation with </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/action/resources/research-in-action/sleep-deprivation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heart disease, stunted metabolism, stifled growth and depression</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made it clear this was not sustainable for adulthood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back, I wish I’d slept more. The stubborn mindset I had adopted might have made me feel invincible when I was 17, but it was not a feasible long-term strategy. If I had slept more, maybe I’d be a couple inches taller. Maybe my teachers would remember me less as that kid who drooled on their desks. Maybe it would have pushed back my expiration date a couple more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since coming to this realization, my sleep habits have evolved into something a human being can actually operate on. I go to bed at 2 a.m. instead of 4 a.m. I intentionally avoid early morning classes so I can sleep in. Overall, I have changed how I approach the act of slumber because I have realized how crucial it is to human functionality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am well aware I may not be sleep’s best ambassador, but as someone who neglected it for years, I can confidently say that our society does not value it enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, Family Feud’s host, Steve Harvey, was </span><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/05/07/steve-harvey-sleep-time-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">videotaped</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> preaching to his studio audience about the evils of sleep.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am well aware I may not be sleep’s best ambassador, but as someone who neglected it for years, I can confidently say that our society does not value it enough.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a third of your life. It ain’t but 24 hours in a day. You cannot be asleep eight hours a day. You can’t live in L.A. and wake up at 8 o’clock in the morning. It’s 11 o’clock on the east coast. The stock market (has) been open two hours. They [are] already making decisions about your life and your ass was sleep…He who loves to sleep and the folding of hands, poverty will set upon you like a thief in the night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the sassiest game show host in the world cursing poverty upon you for catching some Z’s is certainly funny, the mindset Harvey projects on his audience reflects a huge flaw in the American “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” mindset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Sleep Foundation,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adults between the ages of 18 to 64 should be sleeping between seven and nine hours a night to avoid health repercussions. However, according to</span><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/almost-one-third-americans-sleep-fewer-six-hours-night-180971116/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Smithsonian magazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 32.9% of this population report sleeping less than six hours a night, a trend that has been rising continually for multiple decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long-term effects listed earlier alongside the short-term effects, such as reduced cognitive function and memory impairment, make a lack of sleep a dangerous entity to flirt with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what makes Steve Harvey’s comments so confusing is how alarmingly wrong his declaration was. According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.tuck.com/the-inequality-of-sleep/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done by Tuck Sleep, there is a direct link between class inequality and the amount of sleep reported by study participants. As study respondents approached the poverty threshold, a higher percentage of the population reported sleeping less than the recommended seven hours a night.  Unsurprisingly, the income inequality underlying sleeping patterns also spills into racial inequality, with Hispanic and African Americans suffering from the highest rates of sleep deprivation. Turns out, a lack of sleep isn’t the secret to success — it’s a byproduct of poverty. Yes, Steve Harvey is right that the stock market is three hours ahead if you wake at 8 a.m. on the West Coast, but the stock market is rather inconsequential to an individual working two minimum wage jobs to provide for their family.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns out, a lack of sleep isn’t the secret to success — it’s a byproduct of poverty.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how can we fix this? It’s a complicated question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s no surprise that the <a href=\"https://sleepopolis.com/blog/countries-most-sleep/\">five</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> countries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where people get the most  sleep (New Zealand, France, Australia and Belgium) are all first-world countries with much more relaxed labor cultures than those of industrially-driven countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Singapore. These five countries have money, a healthy economy and less of a workhorse mentality throughout their general population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the United States, specifically, the cycle of generational poverty that persists has proven to be increasingly tough to break. Those born lower-class tend to stay lower-class. The American dream is actually not a myth — it’s just increasingly harder to obtain. This is a problem when the only chance for sleep’s progress is with a restructured economy that props up the lower class financially. From there, this discussion can snowball into debates on healthcare, minimum wage and the taxing of the upper class. It’s all intrinsically connected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This problem is not going to be solved anytime soon, and I can’t say I’m very optimistic it will get solved at all based on the dramatic divisions within our government, the stifling progress that causes and the American attitude as a whole. Our society’s obsession with work is too entrenched. The people in charge of removing the economic barriers are more concerned with ulterior motives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, just know that Steve Harvey’s rich ass was absolutely wrong. You should definitely sink into your pillows and sleep in that extra hour.

In addition to being three of the most pressing issues our nation is currently facing, each is partially derived from and interconnected with toxic masculinity. <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/01/25/origins-of-toxic-masculinity/\">Coined in 2005</a>, the term refers to harmful beliefs and behaviors that constitute society’s expectations of manhood. These include physical aggression, emotional repression and discrimination against women and LGBTQ+ folk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As toxic masculinity rises to prominence on the world stage, it is important to acknowledge its ties to this community. The 2014 Isla Vista shooting sparked a national conversation about the damaging impact of traditional notions of masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of continuing this dialogue, we asked students to share their experiences with toxic masculinity. As these vignettes represent but a fraction of the whole, we encourage readers to share their own stories with one another. By engaging with this issue — and one another — we can move toward individual and collective healing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88542\" style=\"width: 356px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88542\" data-attachment-id=\"88542\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/students-speak-out-on-toxic-masculinity/masc-paige/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=650%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"masc paige\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=862%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88542\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?resize=346%2C411\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"411\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t remember the last time I cried in public. The last time I remember crying outside of my house is when I watched </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Water Horse</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 12 years old (that shit was sad, okay?). Other than that, I’ve pretty much successfully suppressed every negative emotion I’ve since felt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I thought I was just emotionally tough. I mean, that’s what my environment taught me. Any sign of anger or sadness was weak, and simply funny to an outside audience. Whether it was my collection of friends or my soccer teammates, the rules of being a man were simple: if someone insults you, you better come up with a more brutal snipe back. If you get hit on the soccer field, you better hit the other player back even harder. If someone makes you feel vulnerable, never give them the power of letting them see it. If your “opponent” in any contentious interaction shows vulnerability, you’ve already won. Toxic masculinity at its finest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I prided myself on being “one of the good guys” growing up, I still remained committed to never letting my somber emotions get the best of me. In my eyes, one of the worst things that could happen to me socially was to have my traditional definition of masculinity questioned by my peers. Not being a complete hot-headed asshole like some of my peers had already garnered enough pestering questions and insults. I was not going to concede any more vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This worked for a good 19 years. However, it was just not sustainable. I never truly opened up to family and friends. I barely acknowledged the emotions of the girls I was involved with. I goofed around and took serious situations, frankly, not seriously enough. Overall, I pretended I was perfectly fine and in control of my life. As an assortment of family, social and other issues started to pile up, it quickly became apparent that I was not going to last this way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter of my freshman year of college was when I finally broke. I remember getting off the phone with my parents and beginning to sense this growing discomfort in my chest. Soon, I was lying on the floor of my dorm, panic attack in full effect, taking big gasps of air, heart racing and wondering whether I was about to have a heart attack, my composed facade in shambles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what my first concern was as I laid in my bed recovering my breath, 20 minutes later?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m so glad nobody saw me like that.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Kian Karamdashti</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a young age, I was surrounded by toxic ideas about what it means to be a man. As an athlete, I was taught a lot of lessons on the field that translated to other contexts as well. Men are supposed to be aggressive; we’re supposed to take what we want, and under no circumstances should we show vulnerability or pain. I was (incorrectly) told that men are fundamentally and biologically different from women in both our desires and our behavior, and that this rationalized most of the violence we enacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for me, I had so many strong and compassionate women in my family that I never truly internalized these beliefs. I was basically raised in a matriarchy, and I knew from a young age that there was certainly no leadership role or job that a man can do that a woman can’t do (and most likely do better). My passion for anthropology inspired me to research and discover that most of what we think about sex and gender is actually not true, and that outdated stereotypes surrounding gender roles are based on patriarchal ideologies far more than on scientific fact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it took a lot of labor and arbitrary situations for me to become de-socialized and to grow up valuing empathy and vulnerability over traits we would consider more “masculine.” It shouldn’t be up to women to teach us this. Cisgender men created these toxic notions of masculinity, and it’s up to us to dismantle them. Recent events like mass shootings and the well-documented disparity in domestic violence perpetrated by men compared to women show that we have an issue with young men growing up entitled, ignorant, abrasive, and de-sensitized. It’s so easy in this day and age for men to dehumanize and demonize women personally or through social media, and it’s just not right. We must change ourselves in order to create the world that all women deserve.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Omar Hernandez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity, in my (ill-informed) opinion, is a Rolodex of traits that every man shouldn’t emulate. Regardless of your standing knowledge of the word, it feels as if it is always within earshot. A buzzword, really. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I’ve known about toxic masculinity since high school, its relevance did not emerge until I moved to college — at the other end of the nation. My personal opinions are not matter-of-fact, but I do believe the atmosphere at UC Santa Barbara takes this phrase more seriously than in Buffalo, my hometown. And this makes sense — Southern California is a melting pot for social justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, toxic masculinity isn’t a term that I would use, ever. Its scope is too large, like shielding a pebble from the rain with an umbrella. Telling someone or saying that something is of toxic masculinity helps nobody; that’s stating the obvious. If you really want to make a difference, assess the issue individually, use more precise descriptions and identify the specific root of those actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe that men throughout the world should be held accountable for their actions, the use of this label ultimately highlights the actions of the lower denominations in male society and presents a skewed image of males as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn’t fair. Take your “men ain’t shit” tweets somewhere else. For every asshole out there, another man is working just as hard to support himself and potentially a significant other and family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get lazy and paint the entire picture with just one color: generalizing the actions of men is unjust!</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Max Abrams</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion of toxic masculinity is one that cannot wait — men need to do their part. When one adheres and conforms to the traditional constructions of what manhood is, the consequences can have hegemonic and dangerous implications for oneself and others. These constructions of masculinity are, unfortunately, imposed upon and expected of boys beginning in childhood. Equally unfortunate are the consequences for those who do not act according to a specific template of gendered norms, which historically have been characterized by dominance, assertiveness and self-reliance. These behaviors can lead to more dangerous outcomes, such as misogyny, homophobia or violence. If a man does not adhere to these behaviors, it can lead to exclusion and ridicule from others, further perpetuating the behaviors in a cycle of desired sociocultural validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By addressing toxic masculinity, we can work to dismantle the harmful behaviors that have been essentialized to construct what constitutes a “man.” Fighting these destructive norms does not subtract from “manhood,” but, rather, subverts repressive notions of gender and upholds fundamental tenets of how one should treat others.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always had an effeminate voice, though I have not always known it. I always assumed I had a normal boy voice, just like all the other boys, so why wouldn’t I?

When I began to speak, they all chuckled and said, “Is that your normal voice?” I was stunned because of course it was and replied as such, which was met with guffaws and “you sound like a girl.” Needless to say, my relationship with said boys did not end well, and going forward I strictly maintained friendships with girls in order to limit my newfound insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88541\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88541\" data-attachment-id=\"88541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/students-speak-out-on-toxic-masculinity/masc-miguel/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=650%2C1055&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,1055\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"masc miguel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=154%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=631%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88541\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=403%2C654\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"654\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hi, I am a guy.

My upbringing was consistent with typical ideas of what it means to be a “man.” Lessons from my dad, an individual heavily indoctrinated with a hegemonic understanding of masculinity, served as an introduction. While he craved hunting trips and sports, I craved wearing dresses, carefully braiding my mom’s hair on days when he was absent. The years passed by, and as my voice grew deeper, my face hairier and my body larger, I felt myself internalizing his ideals and expectations, unaware of their impact. I became less empathetic and my words and actions danced with destruction. Not only had I absorbed my dad’s ideals, rooted in toxic masculinity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embodied them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I grew older my mind became weary, my clandestine relationship with queerness yearning to express itself outwardly. Anxiously, I began distancing myself from my father and the many ideas that I had come to believe. This space allowed for a transformation; the expectations imposed by him melted away as I gained other perspectives. Experiences that broke down gender dichotomies and heteronormativity provided understandings previously concealed by my upbringing. The self-hatred I’d harbored due to masculine ideals no longer dictated my behavior. I embraced my desire to cross boundaries — painting my nails the color of the sky, holding hands with boys without fear of ridicule, chasing desires I’d stored in a closet somewhere 300 miles away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I get older, my growth is no longer controlled by traditional notions of masculinity. The walls that my father, and countless other men in my life, aided me in building have lost their height and sturdiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had to become gentler with myself and my emotions, with the emotions of others, with the words that men often produce without understanding the impact they have on others. I’ve begun to accept my mind’s fragility and how it influences my interactions with the earth and those that exist upon it. As I become aware of my errors, I feel the need for myself and all men to be constantly aware of the pain they may cause to others, as well as the pain they may cause to themselves.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Dallin Mello</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masculinity is an interesting concept we have the opportunity to observe in today’s cosmopolitan social sphere. It’s important to acknowledge that masculinity, while sometimes toxic, annoying and inconsiderate, can also be a beautiful thing. I believe that masculinity, or typical male behavior, is something that takes a long time to master. As a college-aged student, I recognize that I still have a lot to learn. To complicate things, our society is learning with us. Growing up, masculinity meant being a gentleman: holding doors open for ladies (and sometimes men), being tough and striving for success. But as I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that, like most things, masculinity is a balance. The beautiful thing about masculinity today is that you can paint your nails, talk about your feelings and still get laid. Masculinity is what you make of it. So please don’t make it toxic. You do you, however masculine you are. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in my living room with cis boys for too many days in a row is enough to make me want to curl up on my bed and not talk to anyone.

The idea is that someone with a growth mindset believes that their intelligence and skill can improve over time and with experience, while in contrast, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and skills are fixed traits that cannot change. These beliefs are underlying, but they nonetheless dictate a lot about how we learn — Dweck’s research has shown that people with growth mindsets find more success and satisfaction in learning than those with a fixed mindset. But while this concept mainly focuses on the way we learn, Dweck also suggests that our mindsets can have a huge impact on other aspects of our lives as well, whether that be academic, professional or personal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was learning about this research and the different kinds of mindsets, I began to recognize myself as a “fixed” thinker, but I also noticed that I wasn’t always like this. I remembered when I was younger and eager to pick myself up each time I fell down, and whether it was in the classroom or the studio, I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes. Somewhere between tutus and teendom, I lost my capability to bounce back from perceived failures. After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change. But the question remained: how? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fixed mindset made my first year of college very difficult. I found myself often discouraged and simply giving up academically. I took a math class in the winter of my freshman year, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to overcome the overwhelming thought that I wasn’t good at math and never could be. I let the homework pile up and the self-doubt devour me. Remember: One of the identifying characteristics of someone with a fixed mindset is the belief that their baseline intelligence can’t be changed, and I was a textbook example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of my first year, I was rapidly losing confidence in who I could be academically and artistically. It wasn’t until the next fall that I had my lightbulb moment. One morning I went to my dramatic writing professor’s office hours to tell her I was excited to write but I was worried that I sucked, and she said something along the lines of “everyone sucks until they don’t.” It took me a while to warm up to the idea, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it’s OK to suck; in fact, everyone sucks at some point, and especially at the beginning. In that class, I delved into the world of podcasts about writing and books on dramatic writing, and I discovered three fundamental truths: 1) first drafts always suck, 2) you will face a lot of rejection, 3) the only way to be a good writer is to write.

Everyone hopes for an ideal, happy family environment to come back to as well as having a sense of “home.” Nevertheless, for many students this hope just doesn’t mirror their reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if adjusting to my first year in college wasn’t daunting enough, I came to UCSB fresh out of my parents’ divorce. I still find that admitting I have divorced parents isn’t something that naturally comes out of my mouth when people ask me about my home life. To this day, it’s still strange to wrap my mind around the fact that I am no longer a student with happily married parents at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I am fortunate enough to say is that I was able to experience growing up with parents who were happily together. Of course, I, like any other kid with married parents, took this sense of comfort for granted. It’s almost impossible not to when society defines the family norm as a happily married couple with kids.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I personally never had to face the hardships involved with splitting time between two different households or deciding where to celebrate holidays when I was a kid. Both my sister and I were lucky enough to have had a completely secure upbringing with little worries or concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet there are so many people my age that did not have these same comforts growing up, and I recall being a kid in elementary school and thinking it was really sad that some of my friends’ parents weren’t together. I would watch them pack their school backpacks with miscellaneous overnight things in order to go from dad’s house in the morning to mom’s house after dance practice. What I failed to grasp at that age was how strong these other kids were becoming as they coped with a less comfortable or stable childhood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lillian Cheeks, a second-year student at UCSB, had to learn independence at a young age when her dad moved out of their house. While speaking about growing up with a single parent, she said, “I learned to be insanely self-sufficient and make decisions for myself at a young age because I had no other choice. At times I felt like I was partly raising myself because my mom had to work extra shifts, meaning I was alone most of the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, kids who grow up with married parents become reliant on their family for most everyday tasks and learn self-reliance later in life. Many other students, like Lillian, had to maneuver through childhood without a secure family bond and were pushed to grow up before they were ready. As difficult as this must have been on her childhood experience, Lillian still acknowledges that this experience shaped her into the capable student and person she is today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to college already very independent and knew how to make decisions for myself,” Lillian said. Being thrown into college and adjusting to life on your own is a scary process for most, but Lillian’s past made her more comfortable in adjusting to adult life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Silveria, another second-year student here at UCSB, also feels that the trauma of watching her parents’ divorce play out when she was a little girl helped shape her into the compassionate person she is today. She claims, “it has made me more tolerant and understanding with people and situations.” For this reason, she further expressed that even with all the hurt and pain she has experienced, she wouldn’t change the way things occurred even if she was given the option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some degree, I almost envy the people whose parents got divorced when they were young because it may have appeared completely normal when they were children. At a young age, there is a better chance of the child becoming accustomed to a new familial lifestyle and those adjustments can shape the individual into a strong, capable adult later in life.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 16,  my parents dropped a completely unexpected bomb: they were getting a divorce. I was old enough to realize that the family dynamic I had known thus far would forever change. My age </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along with the naivety I carried up until that point about happy families </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have made it even more difficult to cope with the divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Sydney Fishback, a third-year student at UCSB who was only 11 months old when her parents got divorced, discussed how she sympathizes with my experience. She expressed that it would have been much harder if she was older like I was when everything happened. “It would be harder because I would’ve been conditioned to seeing my parents together and used to knowing what it’s like to live with them both,” she noted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was perhaps one of the hardest things for me to adjust to. Today, I still struggle when people ask me if I’ll be going home for breaks. I have been forced to choose whether to visit my dad, who lives much closer now that he moved to SoCal last year, or to return to NorCal to my childhood home that I grew up in to see my mom. It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Complicated” is the best way to describe my life since my parents got divorced later in my life. Being in college and having to discover ways to see my parents, who live seven hours apart, has not been easy in the slightest. Whenever I become frustrated with my situation, it’s helpful to think about how lucky I was to have grown up with happy parents and that many other kids my age didn’t have this luxury. Although their marriage ended, I still have the memories that other people my age with divorced parents lack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether someone’s parents split up when they were a child or a teenager, there are bound to be both hardships and positives in each situation. It’s okay to have trouble with it at times. Whenever I need a breath, I take it. Taking a moment to realize that having an imperfect family situation is only making me stronger as an individual is the peace of mind that gets me through the worst of it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paige Holloway embraces the </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">difficulties of a nontraditional family structure. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/paige-holloway/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Paige Holloway</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Paige Holloway is a Communication and Sociology major as well a write and assistant editor for On the Menu.

Whether it is needing to constantly reassure them of your friendship, or acting like their therapist rather than a friend, at some point many of us come to ask ourselves, “Is this friendship worth maintaining?”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87695\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87695\" data-attachment-id=\"87695\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/image1-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=650%2C764&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,764\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=213%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?fit=650%2C764&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87695\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?resize=457%2C538\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"538\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87695\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As college students, we meet new people every day.

This is not high school, people. We don’t have classes with the same people five days a week, we do not have the same dependence on finding a group of people to eat lunch with and, thank god, we are not stuck in the same place for seven hours of our day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we have freedom. And not only does this mean being able to choose where we eat lunch and what classes we take, but it also means choosing who we spend our time with. This means that friendships are not obligatory, and we can find people who truly make us feel happy and fulfilled.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students need to become better at self-care in terms of determining which friendships are actually healthy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am not saying that this task is easy. In the complicated social life of college, your friends are usually connected to your other friends to create a complex web of people you know, but do not always like. So, trying to get rid of a toxic friend that sits within a group of people you generally like is almost impossible. And I am not saying that I have all the solutions to these types of awkward situations; what I am saying is that it is important to recognize people in your life that repeatedly annoy and drain you. This doesn’t mean they are inherently horrible people — you just don’t want them in your house constantly, eating your beloved Ben &amp; Jerry’s The Tonight Dough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have had a series of epiphanies this quarter especially. I have reached the end of the honeymoon phase where everyone is nice, funny and a great friend. Some people are just friends more so out of obligation or for convenience, as we just don’t click with everybody. The same goes for friends in high school as well. At UCSB, I have learned what I want in my friends and the people I surround myself with. In high school, friends were more handed to us through similar activities and classes, but here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between loving your friends for their faults and tolerating a toxic friendship because we are too nice or too lazy to express our feelings. Loving your friends for who they are should not translate to making you feel degraded or hurt constantly, but rather means appreciating the diversity amongst friends. This does not mean we should berid anyone that seems slightly irritating, as some of my best friends are individuals who I did not originally click with. However, that only means that active communication is even more important, so both friends understand each other and their wishes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, it can be easier to recognize these qualities within romantic partners. Of course, this does not always mean that a break-up is clean, as sometimes even the most disgusting of partners tend to stick around, whether we like it or not. However, just like how our friends would tell us to break up with a person who is treating us poorly, I am also saying that this break-up, although messy and stressful, can also happen with friends, whether we’ve known them for 10 years or 10 months. At the same time, it is also important to understand that people are capable of change, and sometimes communicating your feelings is the most important step toward mending a broken friendship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking care of others can often be easier than taking care of ourselves. We make excuses for them and tell ourselves that they aren’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bad, that they’ll get better, but then five years later, they’re still eating The Tonight Dough out of your fridge while you glare at them from across the living room. But, as adults now trying to navigate through the complex social scene of UCSB, it is important for us to prioritize our own lives and search for meaningful friendships that make us feel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happy.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We do not have to put up with people who make us feel like shit or people who never put in any effort. We are adults, and it’s time we start having friendships with people who are adult enough to be good friends too. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley is a first year who emphasizes the importance of finding and maintaining genuine friendships within the complex social scene of college. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I remember in middle school breezing through Algebra I and geometry while most others had trouble. After every test was handed back in math, the first reaction from my friend would be, “What’d you make? I bet you got a 100.” The teacher would hand me the test back, my face would turn beat red and my heart would feel like it was about to explode out of my chest. Was it because I was afraid of personal disappointment, or was it because I was wary of not living up to my friend’s expectations? It was both.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anxiety\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is defined as “an apprehensive uneasiness or nervousness, usually over an impending or anticipated ill,” particularly feeling distressed over academic tasks and school pressure. Coping with academic anxiety is a struggle that I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s something I didn’t see the direct effects of when I was younger, but it gradually built up over time. At a young age, I was placed into the category of “academic talent.” My defining personality trait was decided for me before I could figure it out for myself: she’s the “smart one.” I remember being placed into the gifted student program in elementary school and being confused at what exactly it meant to be academically gifted. It didn’t help that my parents are engineers and that I’m half Indian — two facets which people attributed to my academic success as genetic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87691\" style=\"width: 554px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87691\" data-attachment-id=\"87691\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-24/getting-as-and-taking-ls/academic-anxiety/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=650%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Academic anxiety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87691\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=544%2C388\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"388\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety is not something I’ve ever talked about with anyone or an aspect that anyone in my life has really noticed.

Whenever I would express nervousness or get back a grade that was not up to my standards my friends would laughingly tell me, “Oh shut up, you ace everything.” This aspect of “acing everything” wasn’t something that was an accomplishment for me anymore; it was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expected</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from my friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve tried to figure out what this anxiety boiling inside me stems from for a long time because my parents never pushed me toward perfection. They just wanted me to do my best. I’ve realized my anxiety originates from the notion that I want to emulate the success of people in my life, namely my parents, but also live up to this “smart” personality trait that has defined me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recognized that I can’t live up to this defining trait. We live in an increasingly bright generation of students who have pushed the boundaries of success toward something unattainable for most of us. It’s no longer ok to be “average.” Colleges, employers, our parents: They are all looking for some nuance of greatness in each one of us, which I was led to believe would be my exemplary academic success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, my extended family told me they had no doubt my grades alone would get me into any college I desired, something they didn’t realize many students had going for them. I live in a pool of intelligent students, a pond of intelligence which has grown quickly over time in which I discovered I am a very small fish. And I’m ok with that. It’s not the aspect of competition that is the root of my anxiety, but rather my attainment of individual success. I cried once in high school when I got a B on a test because I was so disappointed in myself. Yes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an actual B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I realized how stupid it was later that I cried over a B, but the anxiety associated with earning a B didn’t go away, just the initial extreme reaction.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/02/03/stress-and-isolation-blamed-for-string-of-suicides-at-columbia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suicide rates at colleges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — especially Ivy League campuses from increasing academic pressure and schoolwork-related stress — indicates the pervasiveness of academic anxiety. These kids are portrayed as students who never left their dorm room or couldn’t cope with the pressure of going to such a competitive school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I feel academically challenged at UCSB, but the pressure of going to an Ivy League would be insurmountable for me. Being surrounded by geniuses and trying to define success for myself in that environment would cause me to reach a mental breaking point. I’ve heard stories about some Ivy League schools where if a student leaves their notes on a desk unattended, other students will trash them in an attempt to eliminate some competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s not just Ivy League schools. I’ve seen my friends’ Snapchat stories where they’re stressed and staying up until 3 a.m. to finish that 30-page paper and got maybe four hours of sleep before their next class. And that’s when I realized that college isn’t just a struggle for me but an cumbersome fight for all of us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. A 10-week course with a few major assignments making up the bulk of your grade is not exactly a framework that is conducive for students to succeed. We’re encouraged to take 15-17 units a quarter, which is a lot to juggle with sports, jobs, clubs and maintaining a social life. I didn’t realize the extremity of this until the end of Winter Quarter.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pride in getting A’s was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter Quarter was a wake-up call for me. It was rainy, I was taking 17 units and it was the perfect condition for me to slack off. I have never felt as much anxiety as I did when I was sick during finals week. I felt as though I couldn’t breathe every time I finished one of my four finals — not just because my nasal passages were blocked, but also because I did the bare minimum to get by that quarter up until then. The intensity of cramming information into my brain was too much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I did get A’s in my classes Winter Quarter, I didn’t feel satisfied. Why? Because the expectation of succeeding was no longer external, it was something ingrained in me. The pride in getting As was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. I convinced myself if I didn’t get an A in one of my classes, I would be a colossal failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Winter Quarter ended up being a wake-up call for my mental health. I know it isn’t reasonable to place these burdensome expectations on myself, but I still don’t know how to alleviate my academic anxiety; I don’t think any of us do. But I do know one thing: Academic success does not define us as students. We all have learning curves. While one of us may have an aptitude for calculus, someone else may have a knack for literature. We as a generation have a naive but admirable tendency to want to achieve greatness and make something of ourselves no matter the cost. After all, that’s what our parents did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But however you define success, you should never put it before your mental health. The anxiety caused by the desire to succeed is probably not going to be absent in our kids and future generations, but we should convince them that it’s more important to prioritize mental health than the anxiety of the burdens we’re facing. It’s not something we can just convince ourselves of, but something we have to instill in each other. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants you to prioritize your mental health and talk about your anxiety with someone else.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

This is the only correct answer; I never have an alternative. I am conditioned to this detachment from my own emotions and find it even harder to express vulnerability in the face of a supposed professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My appointment consists of fluff: surface-level talk about my family, studies and extracurricular activities dominates the conversation. When it concludes, my therapist inquires if I have any interest in group therapy. He explains that I would forfeit the opportunity of having one-on-one appointments with a therapist, but the support that group therapy will provide is so monumental it should outweigh any doubts I have about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/division/div49\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, group therapy “involves one or more psychologists who lead a group of roughly five up to fifteen patients.” It usually addresses some sort of problem such as shyness, loneliness, anxiety and social anxiety (although I find it slightly ironic having to discuss your social anxiety in front of a large group of people). </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/group-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Ben Johnson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a member of the American Psychological Association, claims that there are a multitude of benefits worth reaping from group therapy, such as support, guidance of a professional and empathy from those who share similar experiences. At first glance, it seems like group therapy might work. In theory, it has potential: You can listen to people who undergo similar issues and find ways to apply other perspectives to your problems, gain a sense of inclusivity and grow more self-aware. If you’ve been in a difficult mental place before, you might find it helpful to attend and possibly learn better coping mechanisms from a professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is impractical to say that the advantages of group therapy apply to everyone, especially since it demands complete openness to strangers who may breach confidentiality. Participants must express sheer transparency about their personal lives to more than five people they may not know, much less trust. The American Mental Health Foundation states that it proves even more difficult in situations in which members are in crises or are suicidal, as “it is necessary to function with a degree of normalcy.”  Yet, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, there are</span><a href=\"https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 16 million people </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the world diagnosed with depression, a common precursor to having suicidal thoughts, and a myriad of them attend group therapy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, individual therapy is also an option. The American Psychological Association claims that individual therapy is successful due to high confidentiality, therapeutic alliance and an individualized approach to treatment. Confidentiality is not easily breached in such a private environment, which could prove useful to elevate a patient’s sense of safety. An elevated sense of safety could consequently promote a therapeutic alliance, allowing more bonding between both therapist and client to encourage the client to share more aspects of his or her life. Such therapeutic alliance can also assist a therapist in formulating plans to cater toward an individual’s needs and pace. However, the success rate of individualized therapy is highly contingent on a client’s willingness to open up and the therapist’s willingness to listen and provide constructive insight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I personally attended both group and individual therapy sessions, I found none of my therapists to be a good fit. For a while, I thought maybe I was just too difficult to understand or that my situation was too complicated for an outsider to make a coherent judgement. So I began doing other things that helped me cope: I returned to my beginnings and slowly picked up my old hobbies again. Before my downward spiral began, music and writing were both huge components of my life. Motivating myself to be productive with the things I loved was difficult, but in the long run, it was an effective step in the right direction. In fact, the American Psychological Association </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compiled a number of studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which suggested a positive correlation between music and promoted recovery of depression or stress. With this in mind, alternative options to talk therapy should be considered for those who do not find words the most accessible form of expression. Art, music and even online therapies are all possibilities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it. But there are people out there who want to help you, and although I found utilizing therapists ineffective, this does not mean you will. It does get better, and you will eventually find peace once you try healing methods tailored to you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time C.A.P.S. suggests group therapy or asks if you’d like to continue your current sessions, think twice about what works for you. Options at a university are limited, but there are a multitude of outside resources in the real world that could potentially benefit you. It is difficult to know what works without trying a vast range of therapies, but once you find the right method, I hope you can say “I’m good” and mean it. The road to recovery is a long one, but there are no speed limits. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Feng thinks that everyone has an individualized approach to therapy and there should be no rush to figure things out. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/","id":6406,"author":{"id":795,"name":"Jasmine Feng"},"related":[6405,6404,6403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Honestly, Honesty is Easier","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alex-garcia.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alex-garcia.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Emily Smith extolls the virtues of being honest with her parents and the role that plays in fostering healthy relationships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many kids going off to college, my parents decided to implement a strict “you must call home” rule before my first quarter.

Usually, the migraines that I get on a weekly basis are categorized as pesky; they leave me able to function but with noticeable discomfort.

Sometimes, the treatments seem ridiculous: Botox injections to the head, menthol-infused patches, weird-looking headbands that contain electrodes.

During my freshman year of college, I switched brands of birth control from a standard 21-days-on/seven-days-off cycle to one that increased my hormone levels every week —  dually managing to make my painful periods even worse </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slamming me with a blindsiding depression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent the first two quarters of my second year in a tailspin. Crying fits would spring up out of nowhere and an increasingly volatile relationship with the person I had considered my best friend was making it all the worse. It took until spring break to admit to myself that what had once been rattled off as a potential side effect had grown into an autonomous beast, encompassing my entire existence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My personal experience with Prozac has been ideal. On the first sunny day, a few weeks into spring quarter, I found myself imbued with a newfound appreciation for life and sat on the Arbor lawn for over an hour basking in my gratitude. While that initial burst of euphoria doesn’t last forever, Prozac has done wonders in anchoring me to the world — a trait that was very much appreciated when a death in the family during spring quarter hit and I realized that had I not been on antidepressants, my grief would have been exponentially more explosive.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the American healthcare system is a dense jungle of red tape, and getting a prescription for the injectable medication turned out to be borderline impossible.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every experience can be as simple and as painless as my trial with Prozac, which was ironically needed to curb a side effect gone rogue. The migraine medication I take now, Topamax, has catapulted both my body and my mind through a never-ending loop of misery: numbness of the extremities, indigestion so severe that I can barely stomach any food that isn’t unexciting and bland, severe dehydration, tiredness, sluggishness, nervousness, loss of appetite, weight loss. But worst of all, beyond any of the frustrating physical symptoms, is what it has done to my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being on an anti-seizure medication inhibits brain function and having this knowledge is infuriating when there isn’t a damn thing to do about it. I can feel my thoughts forming slowly, like a late 90s computer would load a webpage on Internet Explorer. I feel myself slipping academically, and I have to consciously choose whether or not to produce my optimal standard of work or open myself up to the possibility of earth-shattering migraines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no support available for these kinds of problems in university because, quite frankly, there is nothing to be done. Healthcare is a personal choice to make and ultimately, I am the only person who can decide for myself if these horrible side effects are worth the head-splitting pain I’ve experienced on a weekly basis for the past twelve years of my life. And I still don’t know. That being said though, dealing with side effects that affect academic performance is an incredibly isolating experience — especially when the typical response from friends, counselors, TAs, doctors and professors alike is, “Wow, that sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiencing medical crises or medication-induced side effects that have impacted my academic career has been a lonely experience. Friends who do not experience similar health issues rarely sympathize, and I have regularly feared that sharing these problems with my TAs and professors will mark me as a complainer, an excuse-maker or someone who just isn’t trying hard enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be there for the people in your life who are facing academic struggles due to health problems.

Comparing preference night outfits and bids are a thing of the past —  irrelevant and juvenile, even. Now the stakes suddenly seem more real when I instead find myself comparing summer plans and LinkedIn profiles. Another friend has just landed the internship of his dreams, but I still have no idea what I’m doing this summer. What am I lacking? Am I falling behind? No one wants to be a sore loser and, at your core, you know that’s not who you are because you still feel genuinely happy for him. But being happy for your friend’s success isn’t enough to stop the sinking feeling in your stomach.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In times of stress and uncertainty, I’ve found that for most people, it’s almost impossible not to compare yourself to those around you. Maybe we start out looking for guidance or reassurance that other people feel just as lost as we do. Other times, we use our peers as markers to measure our achievements, or lack thereof. Although habits like these are hard to break, the longer we allow ourselves to stay in this mentality of constant comparison, the more we’ll hurt ourselves in the end. After all, when you’re competing against the world, you’re rarely going to come out on top.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society — pressures to excel at academics and extracurriculars, pressures from family members and friends — but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves. Much of the stress, anxiety and despair we feel comes from trying in vain to meet unrealistic expectations created by our perceptions of others. Despite convincing outward appearances, no one has their whole life figured out. Although it can be easy to be consumed by the desire to keep up with our peers and “do it all,” doing so will only lead to an inevitable spiral of negativity and self-doubt. Instead, take a step back and choose a different path for yourself. Your success doesn’t have to be measured by someone else’s. Although humans may be competitive by nature, remember: the game of life doesn’t have to be a competition.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu wants you to take a deep breath — you’re doing great!</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

For the majority of my life, I identified with this sentiment so when the rain began this winter quarter, I was all but excited. I would wake up to the patter of rain on my windowsill and roll over in bed unenthused about what lay ahead of me: just another day of wrangling the pesky zippers of my raincoat that always seem to get caught on the surrounding fabric; another day of battling the faulty umbrella button whose only purpose is to open up the simple device, but always seems to fail at doing just that; another day destined to be ruined by factors out of my control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular Tuesday during week four, my skin felt especially sticky and my hair exceptionally frizzy from the humidity of my soggy classrooms. I was yearning especially hard for my shower of revitalization. On my walk back home, I texted my housemate to assure that the shower would be free upon my arrival. While looking down at my phone, I carelessly stepped in a puddle, soaking my socks all the way though. I bit my lip, let out a sigh and trudged on with the the words “I hate the rain” circling through my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I reached the bus loop roundabout, a guy sheltering himself with not one but two umbrellas biked past me. As I watched him ride away, I pondered the effectiveness of this strategy. I decided that Melania Trump could probably benefit from the second umbrella better than he could, although it was not my place to make suggestions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I continued on past SSMS, I noticed a bicyclist with something on his head. “A helmet?” I thought. “That’s rare to see at UCSB.” But alas, it was something even rarer — a plastic bag crafted into a rain mask, eye-holes and all. I remember in childhood being strictly informed to never put a plastic bag over my head to avoid accidental suffocation. I guess this principle becomes null when facing the threat of getting one’s cheeks a little wet. This irony amused me as I walked onward.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86444\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86444\" data-attachment-id=\"86444\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/take-a-rain-check-on-your-rain-resentment/screen-shot-2019-02-25-at-1-57-49-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=1288%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-25 at 1.57.49 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=888%2C890&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86444\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM-250x250.png?resize=381%2C381\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=768%2C769&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1022%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1022w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86444\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path began to veer left, wrapping its way around the Thunderdome. The sparsity of buildings in this area of campus means less shelter, so I quickly felt the wind pick up around me. I held my hand in front of my face to shield my eyes from the raindrops darting about. While this did obstruct my vision to a considerable degree, I could not help but notice a massive pink blob making its way toward me. I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders. She had neither a raincoat nor an umbrella, just Harry Styles to protect her from the rain. Raindrops rolled down his cheeks from his deep blue eyes. It looked as if he was weeping while bearing his charming dimpled smile. I chuckled to myself at this ridiculous sight.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

Usually, I would have viewed the glittering “Hesperous is Phosphorus” as the literal light at the end of the tunnel of my wet, gloomy trek back to I.V. This time, however, the landmark did not strike me so. There was no bad mood to overcome. I was already content. In analyzing the innovative rain repellant strategies along my walk, I had shed my deep-rooted aversion to the rain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These past few weeks, when I awake to the pattering on my windowsill, I cannot say that I spring up out of bed ready to splash around in puddles belting “I’m Singin’ in the Rain.” I can say, however, that I no longer dread my drizzly walk to class the way I used to. Before, the rain to me was simply an oppressive force, dictating the clothes I’d wear, the places I’d go and my means of getting there. Yet, in recognizing the funky quirks and crafty contraptions that the rain brings out in my fellow Isla Vistans, I am able to find joy in my community, rain or shine.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages Gauchos to embrace the rain.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.
