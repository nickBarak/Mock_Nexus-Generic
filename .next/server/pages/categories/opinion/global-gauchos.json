The more research I put in, the more excited I get. There are so many options that it’s almost overwhelming; with over 40 countries and 171 different programs to choose from, it feels as though the world is at my fingertips. What a privilege it is to go to a university like this where we have the opportunity to travel the world — and further our education while we’re at it. Then I found the tear in this perfect canvas of options: It might not be safe for me to go abroad. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92135\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92135\" data-attachment-id=\"92135\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-25/is-studying-abroad-safe-for-queer-students/lgbt-oped/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=450%2C637&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"450,637\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LGBT oped\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=177%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-92135\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?resize=308%2C436\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"436\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92135\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brea Spenser / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was surfing the UCSB Education Abroad Program (EAP) page for about the 100th time, I noticed a link titled “LGBTQ Students.” “Hey that’s me!” I thought happily, and clicked on it. The first paragraph on the page explains that with exposure to different cultures all around the world comes different views on gender and sexuality — views that might radically diverge from our own. There is a </span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this paragraph that I especially like, and I commend whoever wrote it. It says, “When you venture out in the world, you carry your identity with you even if it is not readily apparent to those around you. Going abroad can therefore represent a second ‘coming out’, and you will need to make decisions about how and when to express your LGBTQ identity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very thoughtful way to say, “as a queer person, not all countries are safe for you.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll a little further and you’ll find “</span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk Levels and Risk Mitigation Strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This is the first thing that any queer person considering going abroad should look at. Included is a link to a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uJKCx7Zn_HGF4QNjW4FzAUEmkYHlzXyOCdu1Zp5kGY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Doc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a country by country breakdown. In this breakdown each country is labeled either “very safe,” “mostly safe,” “unsafe” and “very unsafe,” with some being “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” They also go on to define qualities that make “extreme risk,” “high risk” or “moderate risk” countries. Quick spoiler alert: Of the 39 countries listed, only two get the coveted title of “very safe” (Canada and Argentina).   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before coming across this very valuable document, I had spoken to a UCEAP peer advisor. I told her that I was interested in maybe going to a country in Africa. She was very kind and helpful and informed me that there are more scholarship opportunities for certain countries because they tend to have fewer applicants. She suggested Ghana, since she had studied there herself and loved it. After discovering the country-by-country risk breakdown, I looked up Ghana and found out it is considered “unsafe” for LGBTQ folks, as there are “explicit restrictions on LGBTIA+ expression &amp; rights,” and “governmental &amp; societal treatment is poor.” Okay, so maybe not Ghana. But this must be an exception, right? Surely there can’t be many study abroad options that are unsafe for so many students at this school?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After nixing Ghana, I did a bit more research and found a summer internship abroad opportunity in South Africa. It sounded interesting and relevant to my future, so I decided to check out its risk level:  “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” Yes! This was a win. South Africa it is. After all, it says queer PDA </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead to violence and tension, as opposed to Russia where it says queer PDA is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to cause violence and tension, or in Ghana where male-male relationships could lead to imprisonment for 10 or more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why am I so excited about what feels like less than the bare minimum? I’d much prefer a place that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> safe. Not neutral. While it’s a better option than Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Jordan, Senegal or Indonesia — all of which are considered high-risk countries — I’d still prefer to study in a place where I can be sure my identity won’t endanger me if it comes up in conversation. So can I go to South Africa? The answer is yes, but I’m still scared. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful to have this list, because I’m sure there was a time when it didn’t exist at all. I’m grateful that I have the information I need to keep myself safe, but there is still something so scary about it. This list is a reminder to me that so much of the world still doesn’t accept this community. The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world. When I sing along in the shower to Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan or Frank Ocean, I feel seen and heard, but there are so many people who cannot feel seen or heard because they are afraid for their lives. I can proudly go see Trixie Mattel at a school-sponsored event and know that I am surrounded by literally hundreds of other students who couldn’t care less whether or not I like girls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, other times, I’m afraid too. Sometimes I get nervous holding my girlfriend’s hand when I find myself travelling outside of my bubble. I wonder what the risk level is for the United States — depending on where you are, the answer may change. Even California, a place that most would consider pretty safe for minorities, has 83 hate groups as of 2018 — </span><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/by-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than any other U.S. state. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to other LGBTQ students out there considering studying abroad: Do your research and utilize the resources available to us. I long for the day when we don’t have to worry about our physical safety when making decisions like this and when I can browse naively, as I did when the world was my oyster. I know that I don’t “look” queer, and many foreign laws around homosexuality are targeted at men so, in theory, I could still go to Ghana or Russia and probably be fine. But the fact remains that the world is not my oyster, because no class credit is worth going back in the closet. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes safe travels to all the global Gauchos out there.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

We cannot let this go unnoticed. We are privileged to live in a country that allows us to voice our opinions in public and gives us access to unbiased news sources.

My favorite part of the process was being reminded of how kind the human spirit can be. As I struggled with buying bus tickets, asking for a meal for takeout  or simply making conversation, I was humbled by the patience, kindness and acceptance of all the Costa Ricans, commonly referred to as Ticos. It seemed that all of the locals were happy that we were trying to get to know their culture by speaking their language and would go the extra mile to help us understand something or learn a new phrase. These moments of connection with strangers and new friends in a different language were truly some of the most beautiful and humbling experiences of my life.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I have to acknowledge the double standard that exists when non-Europeans come to the United States. During my trip I didn’t encounter anyone who behaved rudely or was demeaning towards me — which is truly amazing considering the xenophobic comments I might have received if I were in their shoes traveling to the Unites States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a disgrace that the compassion with which I was treated is not typically reciprocated when foreigners travel to my country.

It doesn’t seem right that everybody except English speakers is obligated to learn another language for a better opportunity in life — and what about the people who don’t have the time or money to go to school to learn English?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the globalized world that we live in, it is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn other languages.

My interest in learning another language versus their obligation is the autocratic reality that we live in and must be acknowledged in order for there to be any change. One way to lessen the divide between those of us lucky enough to be born speaking English and those who may never have the opportunity to learn English is to introduce bilingual education in public schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a simple solution, one that is already occurring in </span><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/13/learning-a-foreign-language-a-must-in-europe-not-so-in-america/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much of the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  I’m not talking about the shitty language requirements implemented in U.S. public schools today. In fact, currently less than </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/filling-americas-language-education-potholes/392876/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of American adults are proficient in a foreign language they learned in school. The United States prides itself on its infrastructure, military, strong international relations and other accomplishments, yet we can’t effectively teach our students another language. In the globalized world that we live in, it is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn other languages. We must start the conversation about why the United States is one of the few nations that doesn’t require a bilingual education in schools. We must ask ourselves why we expect everybody else to learn English but fail to make an effort to learn anybody else’s language. With a rapidly growing global market and millions of immigrants moving and settling in the U.S., we must prioritize bilingual education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my flight to Costa Rica, I was consumed with anxiety about how I would communicate in a language I hardly knew. I was oblivious to how much else there was to learn beyond the dialect. The warmth with which I was embraced by the Ticos and Costa Rican culture helped me regain my faith in humanity. As I connected with the locals, I also became aware of the double standards involving my own privilege, giving me a newfound passion to bring about reform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if learning a language still doesn’t sound interesting, you don’t have the time or you tried unsuccessfully to learn it in school, there are other ways you can help create a world that promotes acceptance, tolerance and advocacy. My message is to be kind and helpful to everyone, especially to those who come from another country and are trying to assimilate to a new culture. You’ll never be able to fully understand what someone else is going through, but recognizing your own privilege and being able to choose what to do with that responsibility is the first step toward a more just world. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler believes learning another language is the best way to get to know another culture and to understand what a privilege it is to be a native English speaker. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/","id":5655,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5654,5653,5652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Puerto Rican Protests: A Lesson in Democracy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2019-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/protest.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/protest.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In light of recent protests in Puerto Rico, Nina Nazario discusses the importance of this victory to democracy as a whole.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After massive protests, Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricky </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had finally </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/rossello-puerto-rico-governor-resigns.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced his resignation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Thursday, July 24 at midnight.

Since the storm, the island has been struggling to return electricity to people’s homes, provide clean water and rebuild damaged infrastructure. As many mainlanders have heard, basic needs are still not being met. Last time I spoke to my abuelo, he said islanders living in remote areas still don’t have access to clean drinking water since the storm. After the hurricane, my family on the mainland had to wait six months to hear from our relatives on the island. When we finally heard back from my abuelo, he told us that the family farm (which my Puerto Rican family relies on for food and income) was destroyed and that all the animals were gone. He showed little worry despite the destruction, even calling himself a “lucky one” for surviving the storm with his brother, sister, nephew and three-year-old granddaughter by his side. Unfortunately, many others on the island have not been so lucky.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perception of Puerto Rico’s crisis has only been worsened by Trump’s tweets and numerical claims in regards to the hurricane and debt. At first, Puerto Rico’s government </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/puerto-rico-governor-raises-hurricane-maria-death-toll-from-64-to-2975\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inaccurately reported 64 deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; after backlash from the community, who noted nearly 3,000 deaths, the number was corrected. However, Trump denies the number is correct and claims the jump in deaths </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/13/17855268/trump-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-tweets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was something of “magic.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump also falsely </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151867785368281089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1151867786236440576&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump%2Ffact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Puerto Rican government had “foolishly” received </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$92 billion dollars in relief aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In reality, $92 billion dollars is the estimated cost for what the island would need to be fully restored. Even so, </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress cut that number in half,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> declaring in courts that the Puerto Rican government will receive $42.5 billion in aid. However, almost three years have passed and only $14 billion has been received, which many people have accused </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of mismanaging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mismanagement, and one of the most tragic public spending cuts the island has ever seen, was the permanent shutdown of one quarter of Puerto Rico’s public schools</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last June</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This decision was made by Julia Keleher, the Secretary of Education appointed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In total, 254 schools have been closed indefinitely, which has displaced 60,000 K-12 students. Moreover, many of the school closures have affected remote areas where local communities rely heavily on public schools to unify children, parents and teachers to foster a constructive upbringing for disadvantaged children. Keleher stood by her decision, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claiming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “We saw in the redesign as a unique opportunity to improve the system in an inclusive, respectful and sensitive way.” </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-20170505-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Facebook comment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response sums up the community’s feelings about school shutdowns: “No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.” What’s worse is that the school closures have disproportionately affected children living in low-income communities who were hit hardest by the hurricane. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At any rate, there are many complex issues to be dealt with on the island. At times, it’s difficult to imagine transformative change, especially considering the government’s overwhelming debt. However, after the resignation of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> optimism is at an all-time high. The win of the people sparked massive celebration. I even saw my own father become emotional with relief when he heard the news. He expressed his feelings to me over FaceTime, tearing up: “I’m so happy we got to see this in our shared lifetime. Through everything Puerto Ricans have been through, peaceful protest is able to bring change. It can happen!” I realized my dad was right. These protests were not about reacting to a scandal; they were truly a lesson. They were proof that civic action can foster real change. In any case, they serve as a much needed reminder to Americans that in a democratic state you do not have to settle for leadership you don’t approve of, and you can fight against a system of corruption in a peaceful manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward, many Puerto Ricans are wondering what the future government will look like. And if you weren’t wondering yourself, you should, considering that all of the billions in relief aid being given to Puerto Rico’s government, come directly from the American taxpayers. Unfortunately, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/10/fbi-makes-arrests-puerto-rico-corruption-scandal-prompting-calls-governors-ouster-concerns-about-billions-storm-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple arrests </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the scandal have created a hole in Governor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> line of succession.

Thanks to this humanitarian organization, I was able to participate in the raw, unglorified experience of providing health care by volunteering as a dental assistant in Bisira, Panama. Upon arrival at the Floating Doctors base, our group of nearly 40 volunteers from UCSB teamed up with an international crew of health care providers, including medical doctors, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and one dentist, to prepare the equipment needed for the upcoming multi-day clinic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89434\" style=\"width: 454px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89434\" data-attachment-id=\"89434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-02/floating-doctors-sunk-all-doubts/screen-shot-2019-07-29-at-7-51-22-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=2048%2C1361&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1361\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-29 at 7.51.22 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89434\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=444%2C295\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our week-long stay, we slept inside a dilapidated shack with no running water or electricity (in comparison to the amenities provided by similar organizations, such as hotel rooms). We bathed in the river each day after taking down our mobile clinic and shared one toilet amongst our large crew. The most humbling part of my week abroad was witnessing Dr. Richard Potter, the sole dentist on our expedition, serve the entire community day after day. With the most bare-bones instruments available, he tirelessly treated each patient from morning until night, in only two days performing over 60 tooth extractions. In terms of hands-on work, we were able to educate the local school children on proper oral hygiene via song and dance, apply fluoride to children’s teeth, create patient charts, bring and sterilize instruments for Dr. Potter and provide lighting with our phones, and handle all other responsibilities apart from performing actual dental treatments. Being able to help those in an area lacking access to proper dental care convinced me that my desire to become a dentist was real. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for any anxious students out there currently struggling with whether going into health care is right for them, I wholly recommend volunteering with Floating Doctors. There is no better way to know for sure if becoming a doctor, dentist, nurse or other healthcare provider is right for you than by forcing yourself out of your comfort zone, getting your hands dirty and acquiring real-world experience in the field of your dreams. Floating Doctors is the best organization for the uncertain pre-med to apply to because it provides an unpolished, realistic, and gritty volunteering experience abroad. I only wish that I had known about the organization sooner.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89436\" style=\"width: 507px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89436\" data-attachment-id=\"89436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-02/floating-doctors-sunk-all-doubts/screen-shot-2019-07-29-at-8-04-58-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=1762%2C1260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1762,1260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-29 at 8.04.58 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89436\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=497%2C355\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?w=1762&amp;ssl=1 1762w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siavash Ghadiri believes being a dentist is the most gangster job out there. </span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

You can’t even tell load shedding hit,” Blade Brink — a resident of Camp’s Bay, one of the priciest parts of Cape Town — shared. Batteries provide a quiet energy alternative to loud generators, which are banned on residential roads after-hours for noise pollution.

My house of international students did not have batteries, nor generators, nor even an explanation.

I was just settling into this environment and was finally starting to make friends, but it would all be for nothing if I gave all that up and moved to Melbourne for a semester. I could trade daygers for nights at a classy bar, but there is only so little time I have to be young in I.V. before I graduate and become a “real adult.” Bars and good people are everywhere but staying in I.V. isn’t forever. Someday I will have to move to a big city to eventually find a job or two that can keep me alive, but not just yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who’ve come back from studying abroad say it was the greatest experience of their lives, but most people who go abroad have the rest of their college careers to make up for lost time, while I’ll be missing an entire Fall Quarter and summer of my second and last year here due to being a transfer student. Spring Quarter is already here and before I know it I’ll be graduating with at least a few regrets on my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had some of my earliest thoughts about wanting to travel while sitting on the carpet of my grandparents’ house looking at souvenirs from places all around the world, from South Africa to China and from Italy to Ireland. I would look at postcards of the Coliseum in Rome and dream of going there and exploring the city. I eventually made my way there on a June evening in 2014. The sunset looked exactly how it did on the postcard, and I felt better than I expected to feel because I reached a goal of mine that I never thought I would complete. Whenever I used to think of foreign countries, I would imagine them being completely different than what I’m used to here in America, but walking past the parks in Rome reminded me of sitting under the shaded trees on a hot day in Sacramento as a child, and for a second I was able to comprehend what it was like to feel like I had two homes at once. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear of being lonely abroad still scares me, and it comes from a place of being lonely at UCSB myself. My entire Winter Quarter was one disappointment after the other, and it culminated in me applying to study abroad in order to mitigate those fears of being friendless for another year. What I thought was an escape route from my fears ended up opening more than a few other cans of worms. Proactive homesickness was already starting to take effect for me and almost pushed me to withdraw from my program. I stuck through, however, and listened to the stories of people who came back, knowing that regret is stronger for those who don’t do what they yearn to do. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear of being lonely abroad still scares me, and it comes from a place of being lonely at UCSB myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s also holding me back right now is the cost, and I probably made the worst decision in choosing one of the </span><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/numbeo-finds-sydney-king-of-the-costs-compared-to-melbourne-and-growing-20180117-h0jtvj.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most expensive cities in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Melbourne, Australia — all in the name of being comfortable with speaking my native language and an easy academic and cultural adjustment. What would I have had to gain if I just went to another place so similar to my home country? Would I waste thousands of dollars doing the same tasks like studying and partying in a place that I could always go back to?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t trust myself to keep my word and move abroad by myself on my own terms right after graduation because of how indecisive I am, so why not do it now when people are encouraging me to go? When I go abroad, I’ll still have the comforts of UCSB to look forward to when I come back for Winter Quarter, as well as the support of the EAP program and advisors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I’m going abroad to Australia this fall, even if it scares me. I promised myself I would go to another country during college, and this is probably my only chance to take that step. Traveling is scary, but staying in your comfort zone and settling while you’re young is even scarier.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autumn Murphy likes to worry about her future and eat jalapeño ranch chips in her free time. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6282813d4bbd8beecb1d9bc867033283?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6282813d4bbd8beecb1d9bc867033283?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/autumn-murphy/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Autumn Murphy</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Autumn Murphy is a third-year communication major and loves to spend her free time ballroom dancing and listening to Taylor Swift.

There are few topics that are taboo to discuss. Perhaps this transparency has to do with the fact that the Netherlands is </span><a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/european-countries-by-population-density.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the most densely populated countries in Europe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – the tightly packed houses and the famed Dutch aversion to curtains cultivates a different concept of privacy. It’s not uncommon to hear people openly discussing personal health issues or their sex lives over a cup of coffee. When I was an awkward tween, I remember being mortified when my grandmother bluntly asked in front of my extended family if I had gotten my period yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have ever visited the Netherlands, you may have picked up on the fact that it is a nation of straight talk. If someone suggests getting lunch, a simple no suffices if you’re not in the mood. It’s not uncommon to hear someone outwardly telling a friend that they aren’t a fan of their new hairstyle. While this bluntness may come across as plain rude to many, the Dutch view the truth as honest and productive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I ran into some Dutch exchange students in the Isla Vista Food Co-op the other day, I asked them what they thought of UCSB. They raved mostly about the weather– which is no surprise considering the Netherlands averages </span><a href=\"https://www.xpat.nl/moving-to-netherlands/netherlands-facts/climate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 minutes of precipitation per day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But they also said, “You Americans need to stop pretending to be so happy and nice all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the States, if you don’t love your friend’s new haircut, you may tell them they look “unique.” Or you may agree to “get lunch sometime,” even when you know that lunch is definitely not going to happen. While I value politeness and I would still never outwardly tell a friend their new hair is hideous, I’ve come to learn that a little dose of directness can go a long way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year in Writing 2, I was peer editing a paper that was – for a lack of a better word – garbage. The previous editor left little smiley faces in her colorful Papermate felt-tip pens, and a comment along of the lines of, “Well, I really liked this part, but maybe possibly this part can sort-of-kind-of be tweaked a tiny little bit!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping Dutch directness in mind, I told the writer upfront that the paper wasn’t good but that I could help him out. Through this interaction, we ended up working together on our papers and became friends outside of class. Not only was the direct communication more efficient, but I made a friend out of it as well. Often times, cutting the convoluted crap makes it easier to connect with people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. When waiters ask how the food is, you’re expected to say it’s delicious. Or my personal least favorite – the “Hey, how are you?”  “I’m great, how are you?”</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m good!” interaction. I’ll be the first to admit I engage in these scripted interactions all the time – and I hate it.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, I went on a road trip with some family visiting from the Netherlands. We were in an elevator in a Hilton hotel when a man noticed my aunt’s pouty face. When he asked how she was doing,  – instead of responding with the typical, “I’m good, you?” – my aunt told him she was upset because she was promised a room with two queens but ended up in a room with one king. The man charismatically responded, “You’re in Vegas! You shouldn’t be upset!” and brought her to the front desk to have her upgraded to a penthouse suite. My aunt thanked him for his kindness and when he left, she asked the staff who this random man was. Turns out, that random man was Mr. Hilton himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going beyond the expected line of conversation and not pretending to be “good” all the time can lead somewhere much more interesting. The Dutch culture of honest talk, while it does take some getting used to, allows for more authentic conversations and often results in some pretty good stories to tell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, differences in communication styles are deeply ingrained in culture, and that’s not something that is going to change. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to tell a dinner host I don’t like their cooking. But I do believe we can all benefit from being more direct. So next time someone asks how it’s going, try going beyond the fact that it’s going well. You might just be pleasantly surprised at what follows. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Britt de Visser encourages Gauchos to be more honest in future interactions.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/britt-de-visser/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Britt de Visser</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Britt de Visser is an Opinion Staff writer.

When connecting this experience to the wider social life, it struck me that the largely mechanical learning ideology has counterproductive effects on overall student interaction and may create a negative attitude towards pursuing an academic degree in the first place.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

While the amount and content of coursework is comparable, I came to appreciate my previous experiences in open debate and in-depth student presentations. At home, TAs were mainly in charge of sparking discussion through controversy based on readings rather than desperately trying to find a student to read aloud the assigned weekly paper and then spend the rest of section summarizing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first year, students were essentially thrown in at the deep end, a phenomenon which is exemplified by the absence of prompts in essay assignments. While this may seem daunting, it effectively taught me how to structure and develop a thesis beyond set standards of what is considered right or wrong. Rather than myopically following instructions, this teaching style facilitated the formation of opinions and proved rewarding both academically, by improving argumentative originality, as well as personally, by inducing the feeling of having produced my own work.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83730\" style=\"width: 422px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83730\" data-attachment-id=\"83730\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-24/sheriffs-deputies-discover-human-remains-near-del-playa-beach/screen-shot-2018-07-25-at-9-20-42-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=2048%2C989&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,989\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-07-25 at 9.20.42 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=888%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-83730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM-250x121.png?resize=412%2C199\" alt=\"\" width=\"412\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=1024%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my global studies courses here are filled with data, graphs and theoretical concepts which are, of course, essential to understanding the topic, yet often counterproductive in initiating debate. While students are on top of their game in factual knowledge given the frequency of homework, quizzes and midterms (which seem to arise at any point but in the middle of term), a critical approach to controversial issues is seldom asked for. Questions on the part of the students are not non-existent but largely directed toward the study guide for the next quiz and clarifications or definitions, which students then obediently type into their MacBooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of my classes, we are supposed to analyse highly ambivalent philosophical texts. Our first paper encouraged institutions to consider students as co-creators of education rather than mere recipients. Having read it, I could not wait for potentially controversial discussions in the gloomy halls of I.V. Theater. In contrast to the critical theory, however, the lecture was a pinpointed summary rather than an analysis, let alone a critique. Ironically, the main thesis — thinking for yourself — of this and subsequent readings seemed like a distant utopia, essentially desirable but expressed in too old a document to apply to our classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corresponding sections nipped any serious debate in the bud by featuring enjoyable yet awkwardly long surveys about our personal lives and monotonous monologues by a TA who seemed to have turned the section into an emotional support group. This is not to downplay the importance of connecting with your peers, but it is quite telling regarding the apparent disinterest of some teaching staff in conveying critical analysis skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessment through multiple choice quizzes effectively tests diligence but undervalues opinion and coherent argumentation, which could be practiced in presentations or group discussions. A clear imperative by professors to respond to exam questions in a way that “resembles the way we talked about them in class” restricts the possibility of an independent and personal analysis from the start. One gets the impression that students are primarily supposed to learn rather than think, let alone learn how to think critically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting to know regular UCSB students during my first weeks in I.V., I experienced the wider social and personal implications to this particular structure of academic life. There appears to be a broad consensus on a clear separation between university and the social environment. “Do your work and then enjoy life” is a motto I have often heard around other Gauchos.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When connecting this experience to the wider social life, it struck me that the largely mechanical learning ideology has counterproductive effects on overall student interaction and may create a negative attitude towards pursuing an academic degree in the first place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than seeing both academia and social life as something that can be unified through subject-related discussions with friends while chugging Natty Daddy’s at Sands, classwork appears to be more like a part-time job than a life-shaping endeavour. Of course, we all finish our essays in the last minute and go out to crash Friday parties on DP, but almost no one comes back to discussing the controversies of the essay topic once sobering up with friends and munching on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jesus Burgers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not at all to demand nerdy discussions or to put an end to the marvelousness of casual trash talk for the sake of upkeeping academic rigour and obsession. It is to say that given a sincere interest in your degree subject, there should be a lot more to most class readings and assignments than the feeling of relief you get when scratching them off your to-do list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being critical of the lack of critical thinking also requires a critical approach to one’s own views. These observations are the source of a highly subjective eight-week experience of an I.V. newcomer. Naturally, this is also a highly restricted depiction of academic life given that the discussion or lack thereof regarding moral controversies are mostly found in the social sciences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends from home FaceTime me and ask about my study abroad experience, I excitedly tell them about I.V.’s welcoming culture, the inexhaustible supplies of the A.S. Food Bank and the electrifying feeling of liberation during sunset surfs. But I also tell them about the one-sided academic culture of memorization and how I miss controversial discussions and self-determined studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My academic culture shock at UCSB has been not so much about the content of the classes but about the way they are taught. By following a high school doctrine of internalizing information instead of analysis-based teaching, the class structure hampers independent thinking and debate between and among students and staff. Consequently, students themselves demand to be taken by the hand and guided through the jungle of homework assignments instead of following their academic passions through specialisation and research. While debating with a friend about the outline of this opinion piece, we realised that the nature of teaching at UCSB has not yet allowed for one of the most exciting and valuable characteristics of university life: learning from your peers. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages UCSB students and staff to foster independent thinking and meaningful discussions both inside and outside the classroom. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simon-ahrens/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simon Ahrens</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simon Ahrens is a second-year Global Studies study-abroad student.

Now, after months of paperwork and panicking about what I was about to embark on devoid of any safety net, I find myself reflecting on my experience thus far in my room at the University of Bristol, England. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I was on the phone with my mom, talking about how much time had already passed, that I realized how unmistakably happy I was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had come to England with the mindset that I would step fully out of my shell, challenging myself to overcome my social anxiety and make the most of my three months here. And somehow, that’s exactly what I did. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I talked to everyone I could and accepted as many invitations to go out as possible, spending very little time in my flat during those initial weeks. I was doing so well that after introducing my flatmate to my group of study abroad friends, she made a comment about how extraverted I seemed to be. For someone who had spent the majority of her college years in her room, it was a marker of just how far I had come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my happiness here to my fellow UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) students, five of whom are possibly the greatest people I have ever met. Despite telling ourselves that we wouldn’t only hang out with other Americans, I still find myself spending most of my days with them. From impromptu pub crawls to week-long study sessions, I usually see them all at least once a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I write this, I just came back from a weekend spent in Dublin with fifteen other students, thanks to a large group chat that we somehow formed during our international orientation and kept expanding ever since. This Friday I leave for Edinburgh before setting off to Barcelona the next weekend and to London a few days after.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire experience seems so surreal; I had spent so long thinking that studying abroad was nothing more than a dream. If I was homesick in Santa Barbara, which was only a two-hour drive from my home in Huntington Park, how would I ever survive the over five-thousand-mile distance between home and Bristol? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most surprising thing about studying abroad has been the significant improvement to my mental health. Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the summer, right before I was supposed to leave, I hit a wall: my anxiety devolved into a case of a depression that made it hard to leave the bed sometimes. I was beginning to doubt my decision to go abroad without anyone I knew by my side. My family, while well-intentioned, simply encouraged me to look at things in a positive light, overlooking my sudden change in attitude as I counted down the days until my departing flight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But somehow, I made it to our London orientation in September with a clear mind and a resolve to put my best foot forward. I look at what I have accomplished in the almost two months I have been here and am surprised at how, despite missing home, I am not quite as desperate to return as I thought I would be going in.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Velazquez wants you to take a chance on a fresh start by studying abroad. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tvelazquez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tiffany Velazquez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tiffany is the On The Menu Co-Editor and has been at the Nexus since spring of her freshman year.

Although I had been eagerly awaiting the adventure since I sent in my application to study abroad, I have to admit that spending my birthday without my friends and family hit harder than I thought it would. As someone with minimal international travel experience, navigating major airports and traveling out of the country solo equated to a great deal of confusion, stress and, at times, tears — sometimes all three at once! However, two layovers and a panicked moment of thinking I’d lost my carry-on in Switzerland later, I had arrived at my final destination: a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never heard of the country of Cyprus before, don’t worry — I hadn’t either. Last fall, as I looked through the different study abroad programs available, my decision-making process could be summarized as follows: What is Cyprus? Is this… a country? It’s on the EAP website, so it has to be a country. Probably. Where is it? Oh, Google says it’s an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Sweet, I’m going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to hearing of my study abroad destination for the upcoming fall, most family and friends replied with either, “Cyprus?

To put it into perspective, Cyprus is approximately 9,251 square kilometers with a population of about 1 million people, while the United States is approximately 9,833,517 square kilometers with about 323 million more people. However, despite its small size, the country has managed to fill itself with a wide variety of impressive sites and excursions. From exploring the sea caves and cliff jumping at Cape Greco in Ayia Napa to hiking in the Troodos Mountains and seeing small patches of snow, I’ve only just begun to describe the range of activities that can be found on the island. When you have a moment, feel free to Google “Blue Lagoon” in Cyprus. Yes, that’s real. And yes, it’s even more stunning in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Cyprus is more than just a pretty place. Located at the maritime crossroad of three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa), the small island has a robust history spanning 10,000 years. Throughout its existence, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Lusignans, Genoese, Venetians, Ottomans, Britons and Turks have all sought to take the island for themselves. Currently, Cyprus remains divided with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds run by the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government. In order to visit Northern Cyprus, I had to cross a border with my passport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, more surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me. Despite not speaking a word of Greek, or even knowing substantial information about the country upon arrival, the culture shock I’d anticipated was pretty much nonexistent. Honestly, I kind of relate to the Cypriots’ horrendous parking skills. When I think about the fact that the biggest obstacle I’ve faced so far has been trying to explain what tofu was to the employees at the grocery store, I become aware of just how lucky I am to have stumbled upon this island. Sometimes, I can’t believe that two months have passed by already. I really don’t want to think about how I’ll have to leave my new home in just one month.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of where you decide to study abroad (if you have the opportunity to do it, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), finding your new family will undoubtedly be the best part. There are truly no other people I would rather sprint through both the Frankfurt train station and airport with in order to make our flight or sit through a cold and drizzly six-hour ferry ride from Athens to Naxos with. If you somehow have the fortune to find the right group of people to create a family dinner rotation, to be your travel buddies, to be the reason why a foreign country can somehow be called home, then you’ll understand why I hold this small island so close to my heart. There’s a reason why they say that home isn’t a place, it’s a person — or, in this case, ten people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though some loved ones still send me messages asking, “How is Cypress?” the country’s anonymity only adds to its charm. I’ll miss everything this underrated country has to offer: from the spinach and feta cheese pies to the sweet dog I pass by every day on my way to campus to the memories that will truly last a lifetime. My biggest takeaway from studying abroad is that with an open mind and an open heart, anywhere in the world can become home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu encourages students to consider studying abroad somewhere unorthodox. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

After three years at UC Santa Barbara, I felt as though I was prepared academically, professionally and emotionally to go live and work in a city for the summer. Plus, the current political climate made me angry. I wanted to take a stand against Trump’s unjust and corrupt policies, and DC seemed like a good place to start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a young woman under Trump’s Administration, politics is personal. Sometimes I struggle explaining how Trump getting elected impacted me, and I’m sure many other women, at this level. Granted, I am a straight white woman, and honestly, a lot of Trump’s policies will have a lessened effect on me because of my privilege. But when Trump became president I realized that I had underestimated how deeply rooted sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia and other forms of hate are in this country. Watching Hillary, an unarguably more qualified, more poised, more experienced candidate get belittled by a cruel, inexperienced, loud-mouthed man, and ultimately lose to him, hurt me. It’s impossible for me to look at that election and not see the sexism that is at play in it. It wounded my individual sense of womanhood and left me feeling discouraged about the post-college world I was preparing to enter.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85389\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85389\" data-attachment-id=\"85389\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/ucdc-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85389\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/UCDC-art-e1544915027710.jpg?resize=650%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to move to DC for the summer to make a political impact, no matter how minor.

He represents both my community and my ideals and I was excited to work for him. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to starting my internship, I had heard rumors that Hill interns sometimes get stuck doing trivial busy work or boring tasks, but my experience could not have been more different. One particularly rewarding task for me was answering constituent phone calls. Early on in my internship we started receiving hundreds of calls about the family separations at the border. Many people who called had never called their representative before, but did so because they were so heartbroken and angry. Just listening to them and assuring them that I would make note of their opinion so the Congressman could respond gave them relief. Even though I couldn’t promise these constituents that the border separation would end, I could make their voices heard by listening to them. I felt like I was helping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another moment that helped shape my time in DC was what I learned when I attended the Women’s Congressional Staff Association Conference. I listened to many women from all different backgrounds who had successful careers in politics speak. I was rather surprised, honestly, to learn that more than half of them were Republicans. They spoke passionately about being a woman or woman of color in politics, and how unacceptable female representation in Congress is. Female representation, and women’s rights more generally, isn’t an ideal I see represented in Trump or his administration. But that doesn’t mean it’s not an important ideal to many Americans, on both sides of the aisle.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn’t have found a better internship or community and I felt like every single day I was doing something that mattered.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first week in DC, my friend and I saw the musical “Hamilton” at the Kennedy Center. A lot of the themes in the musical came to characterize my time in DC, and hopefully the future of our country as well. One of the lines sang throughout the musical is, “Look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.” The characters weren’t saying this because life was perfect, in fact it was quite the opposite; they were in the middle of fighting the American Revolution. But they felt lucky to be alive because they saw so much opportunity and hope. And that’s really how I feel about our country right now. Trust me, it really does feel like shit is about to hit the fan a lot of the time, but when I look at other people who are angered by Trump, angered by inequality, angered by all the bullshit that is going on right now, I see an incredible opportunity for change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience in DC exceeded my expectations on every level. I couldn’t have found a better internship or community and I felt like every single day I was doing something that mattered. So I want to encourage all of you, no matter what you study or where you are in your academic careers, that if you’re angry about the state of our country right now, there is something you can do about it, no matter how small. Don’t be discouraged by the vastness of the problem. And lastly, judging by the results of the House election, collectively we took a small, but important, step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Garrett encourages students who want to make a difference to consider the UCDC program. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/the-personal-is-political-my-ucdc-experience/","id":5647,"author":{"id":823,"name":"Sarah Garrett"},"related":[5646,5645,5644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Going Taught Me to Stay a Little Longer","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2018-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?resize=650%2C488&ssl=1","description":"Kian Karamdashti reflects on his feelings about home while studying across the pond.

While I appreciate the perks of studying in such an environment (our school is on a goddamn beach with skies that provide their own Instagram filters), I can’t help but feel my life has stagnated due to the bubble in which I.V. resides.

And I love it. It’s loud. There is no time to pause and take a breath. People in suits, tracksuits and puffy jackets bustle in and out of every little corner imaginable. Sarcasm oozes from many of its inhabitants. For the first time, I don’t feel like a wandering entity unable to find something worth latching onto. I feel as if I am a functioning cog in a machine much bigger than I can comprehend. It might sound contradictory with my need for importance, but I enjoy the anonymity that comes with living in a city with more than eight million people. I can write my own story without the shackles of familiarity combined with preconceived notions of myself and life itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And write my own story I have, as I have dived into things I have been too scared to dive into before, participated in things I can’t participate in back home and explored places I only dreamed of exploring. I can safely say there is no place on earth I’d rather be in this current moment. I can’t imagine anyone becoming disenchanted with this place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why on earth would you leave California for here?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The weather alone is going to leave you clinically depressed by mid-November.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s great and all, I get it, but this place is exhausting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as I had become disillusioned with the vibrant sunshine and peaceful bike rides back home, these people I encountered had experienced the same fatigue with their environment as I had, despite the vast difference in lifestyles the two settings provide.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They, too, were unsettled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I thought about it, it made sense. Despite my own beliefs in my societal integration, I am still a foreigner purposely seeking out the good in an environment I am excited to be present in. The cons of annoyances have not settled in due to the fact that it is very new to me and that “very new” is exactly what I’m seeking. What was my boredom back home was someone else’s rare chance to simmer down and calm their busy brain. I had complete access to a world they don’t usually experience, and they couldn’t process why I would leave it. Their home was to me what mine was to them. We shared the exact same feelings. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen to me if I stayed here? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grass is always greener on the other side” is an overused and cliche saying, but it rings true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this desire to grow up fast while still working out the kinks of immaturity a healthy combination? What’s to tell me these times at UCSB aren’t the “good old days” that I’ll remember fondly in 15 years? Am I moving too fast while wanting to go even faster?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on this, I couldn’t help being drawn to a particular thought. Everytime I come home to my hometown, exiting the 280 freeway, this wave of calmness and comfort washes over me. As I weave through the hills and watch the sunlight trickle through familiar trees and neighborhoods, I can’t help but think fondly back to the memories and feelings I associate with the place. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be a fleeting feeling before my desire to leave eventually takes over, but the comfort my hometown provides is always there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m only 20 years young, and I am not sure if I’m ready to fully leave that comfort behind. I’m close. But not just yet. The world is a large place, and I intend to inhabit as much of it as possible. My London experience in itself has been more than I could have ever asked for. But these places are not going anywhere; I’ve got a little bit of time. I’ve got a life back home I still need to take care of. A crisp and sudden break is not a fitting end for my first two years of college. For the first time in my life, I should attempt to actively enjoy slowing down. Maybe it’s OK to “gather my rosebuds while I may” for a little bit longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2019, I will be back in Isla Vista. There is no guarantee I won’t fall right back into the funk of a routine I had become accustomed to. But with the potential experiences and future I now know lie ahead of me, I trust myself to acknowledge the bigger picture that life has painted for me. This is one chapter of a longer story. With that in mind, I think I’ll be OK enjoying the ride and sitting back while watching that damn beautiful Sands Beach sunset for the next 18 months. After all, I do want to graduate on time.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti is learning that a little familiarity is okay.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

Despite the money, timing and fear of being lonely, having not known any other applicants, I figured it would all be worth it for the experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Bioma Travel was founded by UCSB Bren School alumni who personally guide and work with the students on each expedition. This direct relationship and commitment set the program apart from all other research/internship opportunities I had seen before. Their prompt communication and comprehensive accommodations greatly enhanced my experience. The trip was 10 days of volunteer work and research, plus an optional three-day “adventure.” I originally signed up for just the first portion, but was convinced to extend my stay once I realized how priceless the memories would be.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

For example, the AP Environmental Science Yosemite trip was what initially inspired me to pursue environmental science. However, the structure made me feel juvenile and restricted. Making first-hand observations and drawing conclusions that were physically and visually relatable convinced me to major in the subject; but on the other hand, taking instructions from our “leader” while sitting criss-cross applesauce took away from enjoying the landscape like real people, not children. The fake and forced classroom setting created an uncomfortable teacher-student dynamic, though the staff was in retrospect not much older than we were at the time. The rules were equally as patronizing —</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buddy-system, curfew, alphabetical arrangements, assigned groups, etc. I was apprehensive about this program being similarly condescending, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of freedom we were given.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of what we have at our fingertips here at UCSB — a whole network of cool people and unique opportunities that might just slip by if you don’t listen to the universe when it calls.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no idea what to expect as far as the kind of fieldwork we were supposed to conduct. The first couple of days were full of PowerPoints and lectures, but by the third night we set out on our first patrol. Using the word “patrol” for data collection was initially very confusing, and often confuses people when I explain the type of work we did, but we were in fact pacing the beaches on high alert. Staff members of the MINAE, a branch of the Costa Rican Ministry of Research, led two groups of us toward the north and south ends of the beach. We spent four to five hours a night searching for turtles and recording handwritten data on those that laid eggs, even in the pouring rain.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84986\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84986\" data-attachment-id=\"84986\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/turtles-and-travels-researching-abroad-in-costa-rica/bioma-2018-157/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=650%2C434&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,434\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BIOMA-2018-157\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84986 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84986\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaun Wolfe / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere and energy were like no other; 12 eager yet exhausted girls decked out in the dorkiest water-resistant, dark-colored long-wear — complete with headlamps, ponchos and water shoes — marching single-file through murky estuaries and across the black sand that so perfectly matched the utterly black landscape.

Plus, experiencing the highs and lows with new friends makes for some of the strongest bonds.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84988\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84988\" data-attachment-id=\"84988\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/turtles-and-travels-researching-abroad-in-costa-rica/bioma-2018-102/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-102-e1542658898870.jpg?fit=650%2C442&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,442\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BIOMA-2018-102\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-102-e1542658898870.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-102-e1542658898870.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84988 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-102-e1542658898870.jpg?resize=650%2C442\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"442\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaun Wolfe / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not willing to try something new, why even travel in the first place?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, take advantage of what we have at our fingertips here at UCSB — a whole network of cool people and unique opportunities that might just slip by if you don’t listen to the universe when it calls. In retrospect, hesitation is so pointless and annoying (and that’s coming from one of the most cautious, guarded people you may or may not ever meet). Go do weird things and find the weird people that will itch your bug bites or apply sunscreen on your scalp.
