This starts a chain-reaction chemical process in which an enzyme in the fruit’s inner tissue, polyphenol oxidase, begins to deteriorate. This slowly begins to turn the apple brown during a process known as enzymatic browning. To neutralize the enzyme, all you need to do is introduce an acidic solution, just like lemon juice. By soaking the heads in lemon juice, we prevent them from turning brown and rotting,</p>\n<p><strong><em>Why do we bake it?</em> </strong><br>\nBaking the apple causes the water inside to evaporate, which is why the apple shrinks and shrivels up, giving our shrunken heads the old wrinkled skin look.  Also, making the apple drier on the inside will prevent it from growing mold, which is honestly scarier than a shrunken head.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

had a lot of descriptor words attached to me, trailing behind like a band of toys, each different in color and shape. Throughout the years I’ve encountered chill, exotic and even the occasional “rasbitty” — whatever that means — but the one word I have identified with all my life, “granola”, describes everything about me: from the thoughts, flowing in through one ear and out the other, to the life-altering decisions I make on a daily basis. But most importantly, the granola lifestyle dictates what food I decide to sip, sniff, savor and fall in love with.</p>\n<p>As a foodie for life and forevermore, I can always thank my dad for being the head explorer and captain of all of our family food adventures. Together we embarked upon a lifelong journey, traveling through vegetarianism, raw-foodism and phases ranging anywhere from sprouting to the painstaking process of making homemade lavashak, which is kind of like an all-natural, Persian fruit roll-up. I recently tried his newest discovery: yogurt made from scratch.</p>\n<p>The yogurt itself is light and a little sour. Made using only milk and some live culture, every spoonful tears me away from the white noise of my surroundings and plunks me right in the midst of jagged hill tops filled with grape vines, every color flooding my surroundings more vivid than the last and the only discernible sound being the coarse crashing of waves onto the coast stretching out below me. I imagine this is exactly how yogurt tasted in ancient Greece. There are no preservatives added, no sugar nor flavoring. These Grecian people knew how to savor the natural tastes of the world around them and that’s exactly what I do with my dad’s yogurt. The only thing better than tasting my dad’s food is hearing him talk about it:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“When you read labels there’s all kinds of stuff in it, and I just wanted to know what goes in it.

Initially it requires store-bought, live-culture yogurt but, after each batch, reserve a bit and incorporate it the next time. Start with a half-gallon of organic milk. Put the milk over medium heat until the temperature rises to 180 degrees Fahrenheit, stirring frequently. Once your concoction reaches 180 degrees, turn off the stove and remove the lid, allowing it to cool to 110 degrees. Mix in the three tablespoons of yogurt with live culture and stir well. Replace the lid of the pot and place in the oven. All that’s left is to turn on the oven light and leave the brew to sit overnight. This keeps the yogurt warm while the culture multiplies. Before eating, place the yogurt in the fridge for a few hours, allowing it to firm.</p>\n<p>For a treat on the savory side, mix in some diced cucumbers with chopped mint or dill. If you’re looking for something sweet, just add some of your favorite jam or preserve and mix together. Or just have it plain. It’s good for your body; it has the right bacteria for your digestive system. You also reap the benefits of making it yourself. By taking part in the process, you not only know what you’re putting in your body, but you develop a closeness with your food that can heighten any eating experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story originally appeared on page 22 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/granola-culture-live/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/granola-culture-live/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/granola-culture-live/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/granola-culture-live/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/granola-culture-live/","id":8027,"author":{"id":871,"name":"Kiana Fatemi"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Recipes to Try on National Food Day","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Not sure how to start \"eating real?\" Let the OTM staff help you out with these easy, feel good meals.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This coming Friday, America celebrates National Food Day. Or at the very least, they ought to. The nationwide campaign promotes “eating real” and being conscious of the food we put into our bodies three times every day. With obesity remaining a prominent health issue that costs Americans upwards of $150 million annually, considering the food system and ingredients that contribute to our bulging bodies might be just what we need as a country. In addition to supporting “whole food” diets, which involve reducing processed sugars and other detrimental additives, this year’s annual event will hone in on the issues of food accessibility regardless of income level as well as justice for workers within the food production and farming industries.</p>\n<p>In the week leading up to Food Day, UCSB joined other University of California campuses and held a series of events related to food politics and healthy eating, beginning with a vegan picnic and the Gaucho Farmers Market. The final event, “Learn at Lunch” is a panel that will include talks from the UCSB Greenhouse and Garden Project and the A.S. Food Bank as well as two lectures on balancing our planet and food justice.</p>\n<p>At OTM, we could not let an event like this one slip away unnoticed like the peas we refused to eat as kids. We joined the national movement a little early to bring you stories and recipes to inspire eating real and eating right. I think we can agree that it’s about time we skipped the packaged junk and “it’s time for UCSB to eat real!” –Allison Wright, <em>On The Menu Editor</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tofu Ceviche</h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">by Marisa Ratchford</h4>\n<p>It makes sense that in honor of National Food Day, UCSB would host a vegan potluck to celebrate. The potluck was held on Monday, Oct. 20, hence the meatless aspect of the festivity to correlate with the campus policy of Meatless Mondays.  The potluck was from 12-1 p.m. on the lawn between Cheadle Hall and Coral Tree Café. People were encouraged to bring their own vegan food — dishes without any meat, eggs, dairy, butter or even honey — and to enjoy the other recipes brought in by the attending guests.</p>\n<p>The potluck was blessed with a beautiful day: sunny clear skies and a light cool breeze to keep the sun’s rays from overheating the feast-goers or melting the mouth-watering vegan cupcakes they munched on. The community of veg-heads is a close-knit group who come from a variety of different backgrounds. With its participants’ variance in reasoning, knowledge and commitment, events such as the Vegan Potluck are enlightening for the partakers to learn other perspectives. The potluck was not just intended for the vegans, but also for the curious and adventurous people willing to learn about the meat-free culture and its benefits. As a vegetarian myself, not unfamiliar with the boredom of salads and veggie burgers, it was illuminating to find new and exciting recipes to try.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could not show up to the potluck empty handed. The meat-free diet can be challenging, but learning delicious new ways to flavor food with a complete lack of animal products is an experience I encourage. Vegan baked goods, usually replacing eggs with avocado or black beans, are just as moist and fluffy as any other delectable treat. How could a pasta be made without gooey mozzarella or parmesan? Well, with the help of properly cooked and seasoned vegetables, one would not even notice the lack of lactose on their plate. I brought tofu ceviche to the vegan meetup, a tasty and easy-to-make dish that anyone with a plastic knife and Tupperware can create.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57240\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1986695949\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57235\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57240\" data-attachment-id=\"57240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/photo-1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=614%2C409&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"614,409\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1336308127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"41\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"photo 1-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=614%2C409&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57240 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?resize=614%2C409\" alt=\"photo 1-1\" width=\"614\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?w=614&amp;ssl=1 614w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Marissa Ratchford // Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Ingredients</p>\n<p>1 package of extra firm tofu<br>\n2 medium sized tomatoes<br>\n½ a red onion<br>\n½ a cucumber<br>\nCilantro<br>\nLemon<br>\nLime<br>\nSeasoned salt for taste</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>Dice the tofu, tomatoes, onion and cucumber and mix in a bowl.

I take this break to indulge in my mother’s Asian cuisine thoughtfully prepared for the health-conscious individual. A favorite of mine is a nameless Chinese dish that consists of two primary ingredients: water spinach, also known as morning glory or swamp cabbage, and fermented soy beans. It’s easy enough for an elementary chef as well as healthy enough for those looking to get away from a heavy, starchy diet.</p>\n<p>Some advantages the water spinach offers include cholesterol reduction, constipation alleviation and even anti-aging benefits! It’s no wonder most Asians consistently appear ten years younger.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>450 g water spinach<br>\n2 tbsp olive oil<br>\n4 garlic cloves, diced<br>\n2 tbsp fermented soy beans (salted or sweetened; you pick!)<br>\n2 tsp sugar</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>Wash the water spinach. Cut the spinach into 4 cm lengths, or you can easily snap them with your fingers (for those of you prohibited by residence hall policy to bring kitchen knives). Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a pan. Pour in the diced garlic and stir until light brown. Add handfuls of water spinach and fry for about a minute. Avoid overcooking to maintain the vegetable’s crunchy texture. Drop 2 tbsp fermented soy beans, then 2 tsp sugar. As the water spinach begins to shrink, turn off the heat. Serve on a plate, white rice optional.</p>\n<p>Even if healthy foods repulse you, this recipe still succeeds in delighting your taste buds by creating a dewy, nutty and softly crackling goodness. The dish will make you full, but never regretful; light, but never bloated. Rather than inducing the infamous food coma, this recipe will likely provoke a motivation to begin a healthier diet!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Moroccan Couscous with Vegetables</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">by Lisa Maillard</h3>\n<p>A beneficial “whole food” craze is sweeping across America. Words like “vegan,”  “gluten free” and “organic” are being used to describe this fast-advancing culinary revolution. And yet, there seems to be the threat of restricted tastes when one conjures up images of a “vegan” or “gluten free” meal. What in the world tastes good without butter? And what do you mean pizza isn’t a vegetable? Thankfully for you, my health-conscious gastromaniacs, not everything “whole foods” has to taste healthy. Many global cultures have found ways to truly combine the terms delicious and nutritious. Today, we will be focusing on the Moroccan dish known as Couscous with Vegetables. Couscous is almost like what pasta and quinoa’s baby would be if that were a thing, i.e., yummy. And as this recipe proves, vegetables can be fun, too.</p>\n<p>For a little background, I grew up in a family of French people. I am French. My parents are French. My grandparents are French and most of my great-grandparents are French. Unfortunately, France has a long history of colonization in places where they are not welcome, such as Morocco. However, some good did come out of this — at least for the French — and we absorbed some Moroccan culture before we were rightfully kicked out. Couscous is one of my favorite home-cooked meals.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>For the Vegetables: 1 can of chickpeas (my mother would like me to stress the importance of the chickpeas), 1/3 cup oil, 1 onion, finely chopped, 1 eggplant for the eggplant lover, 1/2 for the eggplant liker, diced, 3 medium-sized carrots, sliced, 2 potatoes, diced, 1 yellow squash, diced, a pinch of quatre-épices (cloves, nutmeg, ground pepper and ginger), 3 teaspoons harissa sauce*, 2 cups boiling water, 3 oz. green beans, cut 2 inches in length, 2 zucchini, sliced, 1 tomato, cut in eighths, one tiny pinch of cinnamon</p>\n<p>For the Couscous:<br>\n1 cup couscous, 3/4 cup boiling water, 2 teaspoons butter, or vegetable oil if you want to go vegan</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>For the vegetables:<br>\nHeat oil in a large pot. Cook onion on low for 10 minutes. Add eggplant, carrots and potatoes. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add squash, quatre-épices and harissa sauce and then green beans and zucchini. Add tomato and chickpeas last. Add the 2 cups of boiling water, cover and let stew for another 20-30 minutes. End with the tiny pinch of cinnamon.</p>\n<p>For the couscous:<br>\nPour boiling water on couscous in a deep dish. Add butter (or oil for a vegan option) and let sit for 10 minutes covered.<br>\nServe with vegetables.</p>\n<p>*Harissa sauce is a pepper-based concoction popular in Northern African cuisines. It often combines other flavors such as cumin, garlic, coriander and even lemon juice. For all the spicy-food-lovers out there who don’t have a jar of harissa, add Tabasco sauce to the vegetables after serving. Dose at your own peril.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story originally appeared on page 21 of October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57235\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57235\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/","id":8033,"author":{"id":869,"name":"Allison Wright"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Avocado Appreciation","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In honor of this delectable treat, the coastal region of Carpinteria has been hosting a festival for all things avocado.

Santa Barbara is among the top three largest avocado suppliers in North America. The avocado can be found consistently throughout Californian cuisine. Mixed into salads, layered on top of enchiladas and mashed into our beloved friend guacamole, the avocado is a very diversely used fruit. In honor of this delectable treat, the coastal region of Carpinteria has been hosting a festival for all things avocado. This year, on Oct. 4-6 the California Avocado Festival hosted their 27th annual festival. This event is one of the largest, free music festivals in California! Other than the musical talent at the festival, you can also find avocado everything. Guacamole competitions, the year’s largest avocado, a variety of avocado-infused snacks and even lotions and soaps that have been made from avocado were all featured this year at the festival. In honor of this tradition, two of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>’ contributors decided to make a few avocado-based recipes themselves!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Avocado Cornbread by Gabrielle Castleberry-Gordon</h4>\n<p>When I first learned about our challenge, I was so dumbfounded. Avocados? I hate those things! Little green mushy monsters. Back in Georgia, we don’t use avocados for … anything. Not on burgers, not in burritos. Guacamole, what is that?! I was not sure where to start, so I looked up recipes online. I came across something unique and interesting: avocado cornbread. I could stick to my roots while fully embracing this avocado challenge. However, the recipe included diverse ingredients, so I adapted it for a college-friendly budget.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>1 box of Jiffy Mix</p>\n<p>2 tablespoons honey</p>\n<p>1 avocado</p>\n<p>1 can kernel corn</p>\n<p>1 lime</p>\n<p>1 cup milk</p>\n<p>1 egg</p>\n<p>6 tablespoons butter</p>\n<p>2 teaspoons curry powder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 375˚ F.

Place in the fridge to cool. While chilling, cook four strips of bacon in a large pan. After removing cooked bacon from pan, fry whole corn tortillas in the remaining fat. Chop fried tortillas into strips and bacon into bits. Garnish soup with tortilla strips, bacon and pepper.</p>\n<p>*To scald cream, heat in a saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to steam. Remove from heat to prevent from burning. This prevents the soup from whipping.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52502\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/avocado-appreciation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52502\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/avocado-appreciation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/avocado-appreciation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/avocado-appreciation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/avocado-appreciation/","id":8053,"author":{"id":870,"name":"Kari Newman"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Peace, Love and Simplicity","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The first weekend of October marked the 27th annual California Avocado Festival toting the motto, “Peace, love, and guacamole.”","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56531\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1566929128\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52503\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56531\" data-attachment-id=\"56531\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/peace-love-and-simplicity/avo-2013/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png?fit=623%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"623,688\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"avo 2013\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png?fit=226%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png?fit=623%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-56531\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013-226x250.png?resize=226%2C250\" alt=\"OTM Writer Allison Wright and avocado enthusiast Biliana Kirilova show off an avo almost worth its weight in gold.\" width=\"226\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png?resize=226%2C250&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-2013.png?w=623&amp;ssl=1 623w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">OTM Writer Allison Wright and avocado enthusiast Biliana Kirilova show off an avo almost worth its weight in gold.</p></div>\n<p>If you’ve ever heard the phrase, “expensive taste,” you’re probably familiar with the food industry’s best kept secret. Expensive taste, as in dropping $85 for a five course fixed menu consisting solely of tapas, world travel for the sole purpose of dining at a restaurant rewarded with three Michelin stars, or foie gras, (if you don’t know what it is, you probably can’t afford it). It also proves to be a serious detriment to the lightly lined wallets of broke foodies on college campuses everywhere. We, as consumers of quality food, when on hiatus from the ramen diet, set this standard for expensive taste. Basic economic principles explain that the higher the quality, the higher the price. People are willing to pay more for the tastes and amenities of fine dining; conversely, no one balks at the low quality beef in McDonalds hamburgers. In essence, you get what you pay for. Or do you?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first weekend of October marked the 27th annual California Avocado Festival toting the motto, “Peace, love, and guacamole.” Sounds good to me. Avo experts and guac enthusiasts alike flocked to Carpinteria to take part in the celebration of the fatty fruits. In addition to a world of avocado inspired goods, (live avo truffles, avo cupcakes, and even avo lotion), the thoroughfare hosted four separate stages with a constant stream of live music and thousands of meandering souls in search of free samples. If one nudged their way to the front of one of the farmer’s market-esque booths, spoons scooped giant mouthfuls straight from freshly halved avocados. If able to remain in this prime freebie zone, one could even try to discern the differences in different strains of avocados. For those that are curious, avoid MacArthur avocados. Their oily flesh and acrid sweetness may surprise eaters more accustomed to creamier Hass avocados found in the standard grocery store.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>But this gets us back to the idea of expensive taste. While at the Avo Fest, I purchased one relatively massive Lamb Hass avocado for $2.50. This behemoth was a good six inches in length. At a fixed price of two bucks fifty for a single avocado, I was definitely leaving with the largest fruit I could scrounge up. After a little gentle rummaging and some disdainful stares, I found the my giant avocado and began planning how best to deliciously demolish it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the long trek back to the parking lot, I encountered another similarly gigantic freak of nature. Cradled in the arms of a fellow avocado enthusiast was what turned out to be a $50 avocado. Only slightly more impressive than the one pleasantly swinging from the bag around my wrist, this avocado was twenty times more expensive. What made this avo better? After sampling the Lamb Hass, I didn’t think I’d find a more exemplary specimen. Could this smooth, green skinned, precious gem of a fruit really outweigh my pebbly skinned bargain box special? As it would turn out, this guy paid so much because he was willing to pay the most for it. When the bidding ended, he was the lucky dope to part with one Grant and walk away with the prized avocado.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This poor fellow wasn’t the only one duped into paying too much for food. Festival food vendors notoriously overcharge for their goods and the Avo Fest was no different. Smoothies sold for seven dollars and sandwiches for close to ten. I was ecstatic to find tacos under five. This relatively inexpensive buy proved to be the most satisfying of the day. Loaded with pastor, onions, cilantro, spicy salsa, and a heaping portion of guacamole, this was no ordinary plate of tacos. Despite being deceptively simple, the delight that accompanies a ton of mashed avocados and a sinfully greasy meal was overwhelming. Enjoying such a masterful assemblage of ingredients was more than just a need to fill the stomach–it was sheer pleasure. This was inexpensive, basic, and delicious eating.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is where we get back to the secret. Good food does not have to break the bank. Good food doesn’t even need to be complex, (though sometimes complex flavours are an indulgent treat). When you give no care to the grease dripping down your chin and can not fathom taking the last bite of a guac smothered, uber satisfying taco, that you realize the ridiculous nature of a Michelin star. There’s a certain thrill in the mixture of smoky, meat-grilling smells mingling with the sweet scent of frying funnel cakes. With olfactory overload and the subliminal hum of multiple jam bands at close proximity, getting lost in the form of the taco seems pretty wonderful. This is a “special journey” in itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To celebrate the recent Avo Fest and the pure goodness of simple food, here’s a recipe inspired by the best taco I’ve eaten in my life. This soup takes five minutes of prep, a blender, and a little love. It’s kind of like eating spoonfuls of guacamole without the inherent shame of eating spoonfuls of guacamole.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56529\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1048476694\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52503\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56529\" data-attachment-id=\"56529\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/peace-love-and-simplicity/avo-soup-2013/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=624%2C423&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"624,423\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"avo soup 2013\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=624%2C423&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56529 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?resize=624%2C423\" alt=\"Bacon bits, pan fried tortilla strips and a dash of pepper spice up this simple soup.\" width=\"624\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bacon bits, pan fried tortilla strips and a dash of pepper spice up this simple soup.</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a blender, combine two large avocados, (or three small), half a peeled cucumber, a small red onion, one cup of scalded cream or half &amp; half*, juice of a lime, one cup of water, and cilantro, salt, and pepper to taste.

Fresh lime juice adds flavor. Try adding a cinnamon stick, star anise or coriander seeds to the simmering broth.</p>\n<p>Vegetables: soft greens like spinach or watercress work well, as do bean sprouts for crunch, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, red onions and avocado for creamy flavor.

Add peanut butter, soy sauce, crushed garlic and fish sauce to the cup: mix with the leftover broth until you have a thick sauce. Add sauce, noodles and an egg to a pan and stir fry. Top with peanuts, green onion, shredded carrot and shrimp.</p>\n<p>Anything Goes Ramen:</p>\n<p>Create your broth with soy sauce, ginger, a flavoring packet and chili sauce. Add ramen to boiling water and crack an egg into the broth. Cover the pot and poach the egg in the noodles. Check egg after four minutes. Add avocado, red onion slices, mushrooms and bean sprouts.

Despite however many different competitions there are for chili and the elitist chili zealots present at the cook-offs, chili is really quite a simple concept. To make chili, you take a pot and fill it with spices, particularly chili peppers, vegetables, protein and liquid. So really, chili is just an awesome stew. The beauty is that you can use whatever you have on hand. Following recipes to a T is for chumps when you can make it the way you want or the way that’s most convenient for you.</p>\n<p>To begin you’ll need two to three pounds of meat. Ground meat, chunks of meat, sliced sausage, whatever. Take it and brown it in a pot. When the meat’s done cooking, throw in your vegetables. Of utmost importance are the onions, of which you should use lots. Also good are garlic, bell peppers and a couple of chopped jalapenos (or habaneros if you’re down with the heat). Fry up your vegetables in the pan and let them get happy with the juices that have seeped out of the meat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Next, add your spices. Throw in your black pepper, salt, cumin, different chili powders (cayenne is awesome) and anything else you like. If you have some smoked paprika on hand, throw that into give the chili a smoky kick.</p>\n<p>Chili needs that red color, and just chili powder isn’t gonna cut it. Throw in a can of tomato paste. One of the larger cans, not the ridiculously small six ounce cans. The sugar in the paste will start to caramelize if it’s too hot, so turn down the heat and keep mixing. Now you’re going to need to add some liquid, so why pass up a great chance to add flavor? You’ll need about 24 ounces of liquid. Chicken and beef broth, beer and red wine are all liquid gold.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve got a nice pot of bubbling deliciousness, turn the heat all the way down, put a lid on it and just leave. Forget about it. Come back an hour later. Maybe an hour and a half. When you return, add beans. Two cans. Right in there. Mix it up, put the lid back on and leave.</p>\n<p>When you return an hour two later, enough liquid will have either evaporated off or been absorbed by your ingredients to thicken the chili up into chili-consistency. Ladle into bowls and serve with your favorite chili condiments. Careful! It’ll be hot (in more than one way).</p>\n<p><strong>[Not] Mother’s Meatloaf</strong></p>\n<p>Meatloaf always seems to get a bad rap. Trust me: meatloaf is delicious. It’s all the bad meatloaf out there in the world that gives a baked pile of meat a bad name. Meatloaf is awesome, especially on a cold night. However, it’s been mostly relegated to the category of “utility food.” Nobody goes to a fancy restaurant hoping to try the meatloaf. It’s time to bring meatloaf back into the foreground of the culinary world.</p>\n<p>To begin our foray into meatloaf heaven, you’ll need four pounds of ground meat. Yes. Four pounds. It’s called meatloaf for a reason. Any meat will do, really, but it will work best if you mixture of meats. Beef, pork, veal, throw it all in there. You can even use some turkey or chicken, but make sure it’s not the majority. You need the fat content of the darker meats for flavor and moisture, so your meatloaf doesn’t end up a dried-up meat brick. Remember: fat is flavor.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the popular belief often held by mothers and bad diners, meatloaf must contain things other than meat. In fact, a general guideline would be a cup of not-meat to every pound of meat. Not-meat helps us avoid the dreaded dried-out meat brick. Also, it allows us to call our meatloaf Meatloaf, and not Pile of Meat.</p>\n<p>An onion is a good not-meat. Dice up a large onion and throw it in there. Let’s just call it a cup. Throw in some garlic too, because garlic is delicious. What else should you put in? It’s up to you. Throw in your favorite vegetables. Make sure you pour in two or three eggs though. You can think of eggs as food glue. It’ll help the meatloaf stay as a loaf and not crumble into meat rubble. Also, throw in some breadcrumbs or croutons or crushed crackers or something. You need the starch to, once again, hold on to that moisture. Say it with me: It’s all about the moist meatloaf. Moistloaf, if you will.</p>\n<p>Season your mixture to taste. Salt is good. So is pepper. So are thyme, rosemary, basil and red peppers. Make sure that you season.</p>\n<p>Now here’s the fun part. Make sure your hands are clean, and stick them in your pile of ingredients. Loosely mix everything together. Emphasis on loosely. You do not want to pack the ingredients together. It’s bad news. Form it into a loaf-like shape in a baking pan or cake pan or something. Important! Liquids will leak from your loaf, so make sure there’s room for it. Don’t use a loaf pan. Loaf pans are good for cake and banana bread and such, but not meatloaf. We are trying to bake it, not boil it in its own liquids.</p>\n<p>Take that pan in stick it in the oven. Bake at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. Afterward, take a bottle of ketchup. Normal, everyday ketchup. Completely cover the top of your meatloaf, and spread it out. Return to oven for 15 minutes or so, or until the ketchup starts to caramelize and harden up.</p>\n<p>When your ketchup glaze has darkened to however much you like it, take the meatloaf out of the oven and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Serve in any which way you like. It goes well with mashed potatoes, or, y’know, more meatloaf.</p>\n<p>After making meatloaf like this, you’ll never settle for lumpy, dry meat bricks again. Ever.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/keeping-out-of-the-cold-with-comfort-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/keeping-out-of-the-cold-with-comfort-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/keeping-out-of-the-cold-with-comfort-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/keeping-out-of-the-cold-with-comfort-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/keeping-out-of-the-cold-with-comfort-food/","id":8050,"author":{"id":778,"name":"Robert Johnson"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"An On the Menu Thanksgiving","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The smell of sweet potatoes roasting wafts throughout the house.

You are surrounded by annoying in-laws and rowdy younger cousins. There’s an electric feeling in the air that just isn’t present any other time of year. The turkey’s in the oven with 20 minutes left to go. This is Thanksgiving, and it’s the start of the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Thanksgiving is arguably the most important holiday on the U.S. calendar. Although rooted in religious origins, Thanksgiving is largely secular nowadays and is the only holiday that places an emphasis on being thankful for what you have, both people and possession. Evolving from what has traditionally been celebrated as an autumnal harvest feast, Thanksgiving is also one of the few holidays that has a set culinary canon: There is no denying the link between turkey and Thanksgiving. In fact, one might venture far enough to say that without turkey, there is no Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>Looking at an average American table of Thanksgiving will net you glimpses of mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing, creamed corn, cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, peas and carrots, breads or rolls and pie, perhaps pumpkin, pecan, apple or sweet potato. However, the beauty of both the holiday and America is the metaphorical melting pot, now taking on a much more literal meaning. As different parts of America, as well as different Americans, are descended from different cultures, the foods that they find traditional and serve as part of their holiday will naturally vary. Collard greens will be found on Thanksgiving tables somewhere in the south. Lefse, a Norwegian flatbread, and a large variety of casseroles will invariably find their ways to the tables of those living in the Midwest, being an area of predominantly Scandinavian immigrants. With my own mixed ancestry, I tend to replace the mashed potatoes on my table with German potato salad as a way of expressing my family’s preference and as a reminder of my heritage. As much as an entire nation celebrating a holiday of thanks unites the nation under a single flag and identity, the variations in the food served and manner in which the holiday proceedings take place are what makes each family different and gives us our uniqueness.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Try as hard as they will, but those staunch Thanksgiving ‘traditionalists’ will never be able to win. While we learned about the first Thanksgiving in elementary school, that three-day celebration that occurred at Plymouth in 1621, the bellies of the Pilgrims after the feast bore almost no relation to ours today, save for the turkey. Many of the foods that are now synonymous with Thanksgiving simply weren’t available to the Pilgrims. They had run out of flour and butter, so that meant no pies or breads. Apples were simply unavailable, as they were a non-native species to the Americas; it wasn’t until 1625 that the first apple orchard was planted in Boston by a reverend. The potato, which was indigenous to the Americas, was still widely believed to be poisonous by Europeans. The corn that the Native Americans cultivated was a far cry from the ubiquitous sweet corn of today, instead being the hard, grainier kind generally used today as Thanksgiving decorations. The lower sugar content and higher starch content of the variety led to its culinary use as a grain rather than as a vegetable. The Native Americans generally ground it into cornmeal, or cooked the kernels into a soupy stew with beans called succotash. While the Pilgrims had unhindered access to cranberries, they had no access to sugar, and the intense tart taste of the bog fruit was quite off-putting.</p>\n<p>So now, having most of what one would call “Thanksgiving foods” eliminated, what did the Pilgrims have in 1621? Roasted turkeys, swans, geese and ducks made up the poultry, which was supplemented by lobster, cod, oysters, eels, pumpkins, bass, chestnuts, gooseberries and a leafy green called purslane, which is now considered a weed and not food. However, the veritable hit of the party was the venison that was contributed by the Native Americans. The Puritans’ tradition of Thanksgiving spread throughout New England as the 17th century progressed. However, it wasn’t until 1777 that Thanksgiving hit a watershed moment. Following the defeat and surrender of British General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga on Oct. 17, the Continental Congress issued the First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving, drafted by Samuel Adams and declared a victory celebration by George Washington, which set aside Dec. 18 of that year as a day of thanksgiving. While Thanksgiving Days were proclaimed by Presidents Washington, Adams, Madison and numerous state governors, it wasn’t until President Lincoln that Thanksgiving was proclaimed to be the last Thursday of November, a tradition that was followed each year and by all his successors. In 1941, President Roosevelt signed a Congressional bill that stated that Thanksgiving would be the fourth Thursday of November, thus legally recognizing the day as a federal holiday.</p>\n<p>How has the food of Thanksgiving changed since 1621? While the Pilgrims and colonials were happy with whatever food they could get their hands on, as it was a celebration of thanks and harvest, turkey became popular throughout the years because it was relatively cheap, plentiful in New England and late autumn happens to be prime hunting season for turkey.</p>\n<p>While the Thanksgivings of today bear almost no culinary resemblance to the first ones, they serve as an important reminder: food is something that changes and evolves along with a culture. The culture of the United States today is absolutely nothing like that of the 1600s. The U.S. is much more prosperous and has become a land of diversity. With diversity comes new traditions and movements in culture and society. When you sit down to Thanksgiving dinner with your family this year, take a moment to look at your table and figure out why the foods that are on it are there. I’m willing to bet that somewhere in your family tree, a link was made that led to a dish being included on the table as family tradition. With a holiday so deeply steeped in tradition, it would be a shame not to wonder. Who knows? Perhaps it could lead to family stories and reminiscing around the table as the people of the U.S. think upon all that we are blessed with.</p>\n<p><strong>OTM’s Perfect Turkey</strong></p>\n<p>Forget basting needles and brushes, and just face it: The only way to get a succulently juicy Thanksgiving turkey is by brining that bird before it roasts. What’s brining? It’s a fancy word that means “soaking in a salt water solution.” Of course, you want to add your own spices to this solution to perfectly season your dinner. While basting simply spreads liquids over or through the turkey, brining introduces the bird to a saline environment, and through the magic of osmosis, brings flavors and moisture to the inside of the turkey. There is no way you’ll have a dry turkey if you brine correctly.</p>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<p>One 14-16 pound frozen young turkey</p>\n<p>Brining Solution:</p>\n<p>Two cups kosher salt</p>\n<p>Two cups sugar (white or brown, your choice)</p>\n<p>Two gallons water</p>\n<p>Three bay leaves</p>\n<p>Half cup of your favorite herbs and spices</p>\n<p>Two tablespoons black peppercorns</p>\n<p>Crushed garlic</p>\n<p>Aromatics:</p>\n<p>One sliced red apple</p>\n<p>One onion, quartered</p>\n<p>One cinnamon stick</p>\n<p>Four to five cloves garlic, peeled</p>\n<p>Four springs of rosemary</p>\n<p>Six to 10 leaves of sage</p>\n<p>Directions:</p>\n<p>Combine all the ingredients for the brining solution in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, allow to cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until ready for use. When turkey is completely defrosted, place in a five gallon bucket and pour brining solution on top. Place in refrigerator and turn occasionally. Turkey can be brined for 24-36 hours, but should brine for a minimum of six hours. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 500 degrees. Remove bird from brine, discard excess liquid, and rinse bird. Pat dry with paper towels. Place all aromatics inside the turkey’s body cavity, and brush bird with canola oil or melted butter. Roast at 500 for 30 minutes, then decrease temperature to 350. Roast until turkey reaches an internal temperature of 161 degrees. Remove and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.</p>\n<p><strong>Hungry Hana Hankerin’</strong></p>\n<p>So, what the heck. A vegan-friendly Asian restaurant?

To me it just seemed like a weird unappetizing combo, especially when I was walking down Pardall Road the other day and was approached by one of the Hana Kitchen employees walking out of a half-done building offering me a free taco. Just one word came into my mind: Sketch.</p>\n<p>Now, after having tried their tacos, I slightly regret not taking him up on that free taco offer. And since then I’ve learned that the reason the building looks half-done is because they haven’t finished renovating — it makes a lot more sense now, and a lot less sketchy.</p>\n<p>As skeptical as I was to try out their food, I promise you it will cause no harm; it is, in fact, actually pretty good. All of their tacos are made with soft tortillas and a tofu substitute. I like tofu, but tofu in Mexican food just seems like an awkward combination. Nonetheless, the $2.75 tacos are still pretty tasty. Out of the two tacos I tried (teriyaki mango and sweet and sour) the sweet and sour was a lot more flavorful. So if you’re a first-timer at Hana Kitchen, I would recommend the sweet and sour taco — even a random guy on the street told me to order than one over the rest.</p>\n<p>After talking to one of the employees and kind of getting a sense of how things are going, he said that they hope to get all of their renovation done by the beginning of winter quarter. They will also have their full menu up then, which is to include even more vegan options.</p>\n<p>However, to all the people who will never be able to stand meatless tacos, don’t worry because Hana Kitchen is going to have non-vegan options on their final menu, like beef teriyaki bowls. Another good news is that they will serve boba! I know a lot of people on campus who have been boba-deprived, including myself, so hopefully this new restaurant will cure our dry streak.</p>\n<p>All in all, it seems that by the time winter quarter rolls around, UCSB students will have a new thing to buzz about. So here’s to the success of this interesting Japanese-Chinese fusion eatery and, more importantly, to the thought of finally being replenished with boba!</p>\n<p><strong>Quiznos Qraving</strong></p>\n<p>The Hungry Gaucho recently found hirself at the end of week six with a barren cupboard, growling stomach and a craving for a warm, toasted sandwich. The easy option would have been to visit one of the many Subway locations on campus and in Isla Vista, but I needed to mix it up. There’s only one place I know of that toasts every sandwich to golden perfection — Quiznos.</p>\n<p>Goleta’s only Quiznos is nestled away next to Albertsons in The Plaza on Hollister Ave. I strolled up to the restaurant boasting an oversized “Under New Ownership” sign. I walked in and instantly was met with the wafting scent of fresh ingredients. I glanced up at the menu to peruse the plentiful list of options, waiting for one of the employees to greet me.</p>\n<p>After a few uncomfortably long moments of waiting, two girls came from the back room, looking at me expectantly. I politely asked for The Traditional, a sandwich brimming with three different deli meats, all-natural cheddar cheese, lettuce, black olives, fresh tomatoes and topped with buttermilk ranch.</p>\n<p>I found my seat at one of the neatly kept tables and eagerly unwrapped my perfectly toasted sandwich. Each ingredient played delightfully off each other, swirling together to create a delicious sandwich, and I was thrilled to bite into a mound of roast beef, turkey and ham.</p>\n<p>The sandwich was good — not great, but good — making my $7 sandwich almost worth the cost and the short drive, despite the poor customer service I was met with. Popquiznos: Would this Hungry Gaucho go back? The answer is maybe, but not any time soon.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/menu-thanksgiving/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/menu-thanksgiving/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/menu-thanksgiving/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/menu-thanksgiving/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/menu-thanksgiving/","id":8049,"author":{"id":778,"name":"Robert Johnson"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/on-the-menu","page":14,"highestPage":16}},"__N_SSG":true}
