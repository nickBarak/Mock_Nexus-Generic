The lawsuit states that Balter, through his blog posts and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1208445918393065477\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several</span></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1268963951481675782\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from his Twitter account, has interfered with Kurin’s career prospects and tenure application.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his first blog post about Kurin and Gomez Choque in February, Balter reported that Gomez Choque sexually harassed students from UCSB and other universities during a summer field school in Peru 2015, according to Title IX documents; he added that Kurin then retaliated against students involved in a subsequent 2016 Title IX case filed against Gomez Choque and Kurin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To report this, Balter obtained a copy of a 2016 Title IX case filed against both Gomez Choque and Kurin under the California Public Records Act and interviewed numerous witnesses of Gomez Choque and Kurin’s alleged actions at the field school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin reached a settlement with UCSB over the Title IX investigation in 2016, according to David Scher, Kurin’s lawyer in the lawsuit. University spokesperson Andrea Estrada declined to comment because the university “is not a party to that lawsuit.” Casey Walsh, an anthropology professor and chair of the department, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about both Kurin’s Title IX investigation and the lawsuit.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Kurin is not a perfect individual. She made some mistakes a few years ago and has apologized for them, acknowledged them, took responsibility for her actions and completed a settlement with the university that everybody was happy with,” Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher confirmed that Kurin was charged with “sustained charges” by the Title IX office in 2016, meaning that the claims of misconduct by both Kurin and Gomez Choque were found to be substantiated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Balter’s blog posts, UCSB placed Kurin on a three-year suspension from Spring 2016 to Fall 2019. While on suspension, Kurin ran a summer field school in Peru with Gomez Choque and during the 2018 program, Gomez Choque allegedly sexually assaulted a student, Balter reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to confirm whether Kurin had been placed on suspension. The lawsuit states that b</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">etween 2016 and 2018, Kurin “engaged in the UCSB disciplinary process and utilizing the proper forums available to her as a professor, she amicably settled the matter with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB in March 2018.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher said that Kurin was on leave, which he says she took “of her own account partly,” between 2016 and 2019, “as a way to resolve the case so that the university could be satisfied that she was going to do what she needed to do to come back to the university in good standing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin’s lawsuit alleges that in reporting about the Title IX investigation and Kurin’s suspension, “Balter acted with overt malice, hatred, and ill will towards Kurin.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s trying to destroy her. He’s trying to prevent her from getting tenure. That’s what he’s doing. That is why we filed this lawsuit,” Scher told the Nexus over Zoom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not all false,” he said, referring to Balter’s reporting, “but a lot of it is dramatically exaggerated and we cannot take it anymore. We’re tired of it. He just needs to stop and go away so that Dr. Kurin can go before the tenure board truthfully, honestly, with actual facts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that Balter’s blogs “repeatedly demand that Kurin not be granted tenure and that she otherwise be banned from any kind of gainful employment.” The lawsuit points to instances from Balter’s past as evidence of a pattern of misconduct, including negative Amazon reviews of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Bull-Catalhoyuk-Archaeological-Civilization/dp/1598740695/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594356393&amp;refinements=p_27%3AMichael+Balter&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a book</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Balter wrote in 2009 called “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goddess and the Bull: Catalhoyuk–An Archaeological Journey to the Dawn of Civilization,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which centered around an archaeological dig. The lawsuit says the book focuses more on “who [the archeologists] hooked up with and when.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit describes Balter’s dismissal from his former job at Science Magazine, alleging it was for “misconduct” and a “serious breach of trust,” both of which Balter denied on his blog, on social media and when speaking to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said his dismissal from Science Magazine was due to a “longstanding mutual breakdown of trust” and that Kurin “cherry-picked negative things about my book.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She was basically trying to paint me out as being somebody who maybe knew nothing about archaeology and who was constantly getting fired from jobs that I actually really was not fired from,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One part of this case centers around Balter’s wording in his reporting, in which he frequently describes Kurin being found “guilty” of retaliation by a Title IX investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said that he used the word “guilty” in the colloquial sense, not a legal sense, while Scher said that Balter’s use of the word implies that Kurin was convicted of a crime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Title IX charged her [with] sustained charges. Sustaining charges does not mean guilty,” but instead means that the claims in the Title IX case against both Gomez Choque and Kurin were found to be substantiated, Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he stands by his use of the word “guilty” and won’t retract his blog posts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not apologizing for the word guilty …  And I think that they can’t win the case on that; in the colloquial sense of the word, she was found guilty of misconduct by Title IX,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said that “the University investigates all reports of alleged misconduct by faculty” but could not comment on specific cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit cites Balter’s social media posts as evidence that he acted with overt malice against Kurin and knowingly published false statements against her, such as reporting that Kurin attempted to cover up Gomez Choque’s alleged misconduct and refused to cooperate with the Title IX investigation. In those posts, Balter called on UCSB and the anthropology department to not give Kurin tenure, according to the lawsuit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter argues he has a First Amendment right to post his opinions on his blog and social media, including those encouraging UCSB to not give Kurin tenure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have said openly and publicly that I do not believe Danielle Kurin should be given tenure, because I think that her misconduct shows that she cannot be trusted around students,” Balter said. “I’m entitled to have an opinion under the First Amendment about what the result of all this should be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he carries no malice toward Kurin because he had never heard of her before he began reporting on her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I haven’t made up any stories about Danielle Kurin. I haven’t said anything about her that I don’t firmly believe to be true based on my own reporting,” Balter said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter has until Aug. 15 to respond to the lawsuit, less than a month before Kurin’s tenure review is scheduled to begin. Scher said he plans to update the lawsuit with more examples of Balter’s alleged overt malice toward Kurin in an amended filing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he is looking for a First Amendment lawyer to take on his case, but said he is confident that his reporting and social media posts are protected under the law. He has also created a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/freedom-of-the-press-defense-fund-kurin-v-balter\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cover upcoming legal expenses and has since raised over $3,700 as of July 11. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I reported the truth. I reported it faithfully. I reported it in good faith. I am not guilty of defamation by a long shot,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

While the recommendations expand on work done by the Academic Senate’s Public Safety Task Force and the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing, they also criticize the groups’ recent reports as “narrow-bore and technocratic reforms that have failed to address the underlying roots of racialized policing.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendations echo </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/polling-defund-the-police.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calls around the country for communities to defund their police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> departments and redirect the funding to community services, especially those that benefit Black communities and communities of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Academic Council recommended that the UC: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“substantially” defund campus police departments and move the funding toward efforts to develop “alternative modes of campus safety that minimize and/or abolish the reliance on policing and other criminalizing responses” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in mental and physical health services, especially for Black students and other marginalized students “who have been historically targeted by police violence” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove firearms from campus police’s standard equipment </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminate partnerships with police agencies outside of the UC and restrict access of non-UC police to campus property </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement the recommendations over three years through campus and UC-wide groups which “prioritize the participation of those who have traditionally experienced violence and mistreatment at the hands of police” </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bhavnani said the recommendations “offer a guide for rethinking the role of police on UC campuses” and could spark needed conversations between university officials. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano will step down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from her position as president on Aug. 1.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judges of the 2019 UC Los Angeles Bollywood Fusion dance competition Jhoomti Shaam were about to announce the winners of that year’s competition. But the women of UCSB Taara — a dance team performing South Asian dance styles — had already decided they wouldn’t place at the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were so many amazing teams and we had accepted it. We were like, ‘You know what, we’re going to get last. And that’s okay,’” Natasha Nema, one of the group’s four founding members, said. “We were genuinely fine with getting last because we just couldn’t even believe that we were there in the first place against that many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group had been together for less than a year, and after scoping out the competition, they thought they didn’t stand a chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really weren’t even listening, cause we were like, ‘Oh, we don’t really care. Like, yeah, we’ll listen for second and first, sure. But third place, we don’t really care,” Nema recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the judges announced the winners –– they placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t even comprehend that our name was being spoken, that we just paused for a little bit. And then we screamed, it was like two seconds later,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In less than a year since the group’s inception in June 2018, the four hopeful members became a winning team of 12 in their dream competition. That was in March 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, in February 2020, UCSB Taara took first place at Bollywood Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This June, the four original members of UCSB Taara –– Nema, Shivani Shah, Sejal Chandra and Jashanna Walia –– graduated from UCSB and said goodbye to the group they envisioned, nurtured and led to victory over two years. For those four women, leaving Taara “Gen One,” or what they call the first generation of UCSB Taara dancers, meant leaving a lasting legacy at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have our literal legacy on this campus and a part of us still at UCSB forever, I think, to me at least, is really, really special. It’s like a home you’ll always have when you visit campus and a bond you’ll always be a part of, no matter how old you get,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia recently passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, but they expect to watch the group progress for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t even imagine being old enough to see Taara Gen 10 … It’s changed so much in just two years that I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like in another two years,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in the summer of 2018, the girls buckled down in brand building and recruiting efforts. They decided on their official name –– Taara, which means star in Hindi –– designed a logo, ordered team jerseys and hired a DJ to create a dance mix for their group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema handled the marketing side, which meant legitimizing the team, recruiting new members and defining their style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really wanted for people to take us seriously within the circuit because there were already so many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating Taara, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia were all in other Bollywood or Bhangra dance groups at UCSB but had frustrations with the groups’ leadership. So the four decided to create their own group: a competitive, all-female team that fused the styles of Bollywood, Bhangra, hip-hop and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But starting a new group meant that Taara didn’t have a proven reputation to help recruit dancers. New members would have to take a leap of faith, and the original four had to convince recruits  that Taara could go the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How do we get all these new people to trust us? How do we get these people to commit 20 hours a week, at least, of dancing, to get them to the next place where we can compete and where we can prove ourselves?” Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema took to social media, scouring Facebook pages for incoming freshmen and potential recruits, and even went as far as downloading dating apps. Some of the others made friends with dancers already in the competition circuit, Desi Dance Network, to learn insider tips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At tryouts later that year, Taara accepted 12 new members, bringing the team to 18. But that number was quick to dwindle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally just two days later, girls would start dropping out” due to the time commitments,  Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time their first competition came around, their group was down to a solid 13 members, just one member more than the minimum required to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That year, UCSB Taara competed in back-to-back competitions for three straight weekends. After the first competition, one teammate dropped out on the drive back to UCSB. Now, they were down to 12, and the team had to rearrange dance formations for the next two weekends of competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders said that competition season was grueling for the team. Between balancing school schedules with dance practice, the four struggled to keep the team motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone’s grades are falling, no one is sleeping, everyone’s sick, you’re just practicing in parking lots,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taara didn’t have its own designated space to practice on campus, so the captains had to get creative in finding a space to dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would squeeze ourselves into tiny rooms,” Shah said. “We snuck into the theater building. We snuck into [the Humanities and Social Sciences Building]. We snuck into Rob Gym. We snuck into so many [buildings], just so that we could have some floor to dance on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the next weekend’s competition, Taara placed eighth –– last place. The girls used the week between that competition and their next to rearrange parts of their performance with feedback from the judges. At the last competition that season –– Jhoomti Shaam –– Taara placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning that, not only was it just amazing because it was our dream competition, but I think it finally showed the team that everything we did was for a reason,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team knew at that moment, claiming their trophy, that the tireless hours of practice, sleepless nights and long drives to competitions had paid off. For a team that wasn’t expecting to place at all, taking home third place was more than a victory — it was proof that Taara lived up to its name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a new generation of Taara prepares to take the reign, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia agree that Gen One created a precedent –– and a bond –– that will live on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gen One, especially, everyone just grew so close and over everything, it was just a family. I think even leaving it, I know that everyone’s still going to be a team forever, as cheesy as it sounds,” Walia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was no accident that Taara Gen One became a family since it was one of the group’s first goals when they set out to create Taara. They wanted to compete and impress, but mostly, they wanted to dance with people they loved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were 12 small girls, but we were the loudest girls in every room and we were just having the best time. And I think that like, like positive energy really just attracted others to us,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taara isn’t just a dance team.

400;\">The Legal Resource Center (LRC) currently has two lawyers contracted as student legal services advisors; the positions provide confidential, privileged legal counseling for students. The student legal services advisor job description, meant to convert the contracted lawyers into employees, was changed from “inform and advise” to “educate and inform,” according to the amended job description, which the Nexus obtained from Sabina Menzhausen, the incoming student unit director for the LRC and a fifth-year biopsychology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that the LRC — located at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista — will no longer offer its protected counseling service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen and last year’s student unit director, Riley Traut, launched a campaign to reverse the university’s changes to the job description and published a Change.org </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nancy-g-hamill-protect-ucsb-student-access-to-privileged-legal-counseling-services-from-the-lrc?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23075573_en-US%3A1&amp;recruiter=724949681&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on June 25 calling for the university to walk back the changes to the job description. As of June 28, the petition has collected 1,762 signatures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offered Robin Unander, the current Associated Students (A.S.) LRC student legal services advisor, the position under the new job description. The other attorney working for the LRC, Ron Perry, said he did not know enough about the negotiations between Unander and UCSB to appropriately comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander’s contract was supposed to expire on June 30, but UCSB extended it to July 10 in order to allow for more time to negotiate the job description</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB does not reverse the contract’s description of the job, UCSB students will be without privileged, confidential counseling at the LRC, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new changes to the job description, students may ask general legal questions, such as how much time a landlord has to return a security deposit, but students cannot obtain legal counsel or case-specific legal advice from the LRC employee. The student legal services advisor must refer them to someone else, possibly a lawyer retained as a vendor by the university, according to Unander.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that the “legal guidance resources” will continue at the LRC, and that the current concerns over LRC services are based on a “false rumor,” but she declined to elaborate further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada’s comments are “confusing” according to Unander, who said that Estrada’s response does not make sense given the job description in the student legal services advisor contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The changes to the job description] give the university, as well as university police, etc., access to these kinds of cases students come in with and that abolishes the integrity of what the LRC stands for,” Menzhausen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This could castrate that service by eliminating [students’] ability to walk in there and consult on their legal issues without fear of being exposed,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nancy Hamill, UCSB chief campus counsel, did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change in the student legal services advisor job description also means that the advisor will become a mandated reporter, an employee who is legally required to report sexual misconduct allegations, and could be compelled to disclose information a student told them to the authorities, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d also have to report if somebody came to me as a sexual assault survivor and they wanted to know their options and their rights, but they weren’t sure if they wanted to proceed legally or make claims. I would now have to report them,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new job description violates the ballot measure which students voted on in 2001 to provide “free legal education and consultation” as a part of the LRC’s mission, according to Menzhausen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen said that the A.S. executive office told her that confidential counseling would remain in place but has not responded to her requests for clarification. However, Menzhausen noted that higher offices, such as the campus counsel, are more responsible for the change in job description than the A.S. executive office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email between Melinda Crawford, a UCSB human resources official, and Unander, Crawford said that the amended job description means that Unander “will not be practicing law in this role,” and that Unander is “not permitted to form an attorney-client relationship with anyone.” This email was provided to the Nexus by Unander’s lawyer, Erin Parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job description was amended in mid-June, when Unander asked for employment benefits such as retirement credits, and that the university pay for her mandatory continuing legal education and annual state bar fees during the contract’s negotiations, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks alleges that UCSB made changes to the job description offered to Unander as a retaliatory act after Unander requested employee benefits. Parks said that UCSB misclassified Unander as an independent contractor and that Unander’s responsibilities under her current job description fall under the legal definition of an employee, thus making her eligible for employee benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a person makes a claim that there’s potential violations of law, and immediately something happens like this, that smacks of retaliation,” Parks said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When an individual says, ‘You’ve been breaking the law, you’ve been violating the law and it’s damaged me,’ and the employer then does something to adversely affect their continuing relationship like, ‘We’re no longer going to let you practice law,’ that’s huge, that’s retaliation,” Parks continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada did not respond to a request for comment regarding these allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks requested that UCSB allow Unander to continue working beyond the June 30 expiration date of her current contract, which allows her to offer privileged counseling at the LRC.  The LRC hopes the extension will allow for more time to negotiate the job description while maintaining the current level of legal service to students, according to Unander, who added that UCSB has not yet responded to that request.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they do not agree to maintain status quo then on July 1 LRC will not be able to function,” she said in a text message to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander has worked with the LRC as an independent contractor since 2003, and since she first joined, Unander said the LRC has provided counsel to at least 16,000 students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander noted that, due to working on behalf of the LRC for over 16 years, she has no private practice to fall back on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the amended job description, Unander would be classified as an official employee of UCSB, rather than an independent contractor, but because she will not practice law in the position, she would not receive the benefits associated with being a practicing attorney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers of lawyers normally reimburse their bar fees, and Unander’s legal counterparts at UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley — who are all employees of the university — have their bar fees reimbursed, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that the updated position does not require that the employee holding it have a law license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that the new rules would present a dilemma for whoever fills the position, since in order to know whether or not they can simply give general legal information or recommend consultation with a lawyer, they need to know what legal problem a student has, which would not be privileged if disclosed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a normal school year, the LRC serves 1,000 to 1,300 students, primarily dealing with issues relating to crime, according to Unander. Students also come to the LRC for housing issues and conflicts between students and their landlords, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LRC also helps students with more serious legal issues. Erick Velazquez Andrade, a fourth-year microbiology major, said he uses the confidential legal counseling services at the LRC to navigate the complex legal web of immigration law. Recently, he used the LRC for help in filling out paperwork regarding his legal status, he told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s imperative that I’m able to stay here in the United States, be able to finish graduating from UCSB,” Velazquez Andrade said. “I wouldn’t be able to have access to an immigration law firm otherwise.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Velazquez Andrade was also one of over 40 tenants who </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/over-40-former-tenants-sued-isla-vista-luxury-living-over-security-deposit-disputes-and-won/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> local landlord Isla Vista Luxury Living (IVLL) over security deposit disputes and won, a victory he credits to the consultations he received at the LRC. Velazquez Andrade said the LRC gave him the necessary tools to present and win his legal argument against IVLL through representing himself in small claims court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that he was able to pay for summer classes with the money he received from that lawsuit, which amounted to $1,020 out of his $1,750 security deposit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen said she worries about students avoiding the LRC in the future out of fear that what they divulge to the student legal services advisor will not be privileged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students are] still going to be paying for the service, but they’re not going to be able to access it and might choose not to out of fear of potential retaliation or consequences,” Menzhausen said. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [June 28, 6:45 p.m.]: A previous version of this article was corrected to refer to

a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Tom Huang, a first-year electrical engineering student from China, and many other international students, that decision meant choosing between his home at UC Santa Barbara or his home an ocean away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he was faced with either staying in California for the remainder of the quarter — knowing he’d be separated from his family during a pandemic —  or moving back to Shanghai, where he would face two weeks of mandatory isolation and a 15-hour time difference for lectures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of winter quarter, Huang said he decided to return home, mainly because of safety concerns he had with staying in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the situation in China is recovering, especially because I’m not from Wuhan. I’m from Shanghai and all the city is actually dealing with it pretty well. My dad resumed working in mid-February and we know that the peak is already passed,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do believe it is safer in China than the U.S. It’s not even a government problem. People in the U.S. don’t even have the awareness to wear a mask or anything like that. So I felt a bit concerned [staying in the U.S.].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students at UCSB have faced a unique set of difficulties in keeping up with coursework during the coronavirus pandemic. The switch to remote learning forced students to quickly decide whether to stay in Santa Barbara or go to their home countries, a hardship that domestic students did not have to navigate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-19/majority-of-fall-quarter-classes-to-be-held-remotely-tuition-and-student-fees-will-not-change/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB recently unveiled its plan for hybrid instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Fall Quarter 2020, some uncertainty still looms for international students, whose options for the upcoming quarter make the decision between home and UCSB more complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email outlining fall quarter protocols, Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced that all first-year international students will have the option to continue with remote curriculum “sufficient for full-time status,” and that “any student who wishes to continue with a full remote offering may do so without being present on or near campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many international students are unsure whether they can get visas renewed to re-enter the U.S., or if coming to the U.S. is the safest option, according to Hak Zheng, a second-year physics major in the College of Creative Studies, currently back home in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought a one-way ticket because I’m so uncertain about when I can come back,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m actually not sure if I wanted to come back right now if I’m able to. They might not be allowing any non-citizen people to come in [to the U.S.].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng said it was “obvious” for him to go back to Japan instead of “being by myself in I.V.” He tentatively plans to come back to the U.S. for fall quarter, even if his classes are all online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If fall quarter is still online but the U.S. lets me come back inside, I might consider coming back, just because I do feel like my productivity is low here, so I might decide that I’ve had enough time with my family, now I’m gonna go back to my school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students across the country, while disconnected from campus and tuning in to lectures over Zoom, have shifted to a “new normal” over the past few months. This adjustment is even greater for international students, who are trying to keep up with classes in a different time zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students who have chosen to move back home have had to, in some cases, attend lectures and take exams in the middle of the night or early morning. While some professors chose to hold asynchronous classes over the past quarter — which international students could attend to on their own time — there was limited flexibility when it came to exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng had Zoom lectures at 5 a.m. twice a week for one class and had to take the midterm and final exams at 3 a.m. for another class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students who stayed in the U.S. have their normal time and normal schedule, but we have to do this weird scheduling thing, so the score is not a good reflection of where we are. I don’t know if any professors are going to take that into consideration at all, but that’s just something I’m a little concerned about,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we as human beings need that strict sleep schedule to operate well. I feel like I’m less energetic than usual. But I’m seeing it as something that I just have to deal with for this quarter, hopefully only this quarter, but who knows.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time zone difference between California and home proved to be a major factor in some international students’ decision to remain in the U.S. To avoid the time difference, Aimee Wang — a third-year sociology major from China — decided to stay at a friend’s house in Rancho Cucamonga this quarter after moving out of her sorority house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang ran a successful Associated Students Senate campaign for a College of Letters and Science seat, becoming the first international student elected as senator.  But the demands of the job, from running for her seat to beginning her duties at the end of the quarter, meant moving back to China would have been a “huge hassle,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My friends that I’ve spoken with said they’re not going back to China over the summer because, right now, when we go back, we have to quarantine ourselves,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So it’s kind of a very long process to go back, then spend almost a month [quarantining] by yourself. That may be half of a normal summer break, just to come back to the U.S. and you’d probably have to quarantine yourself again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another obstacle for students moving back to China in particular is that they have to use a virtual private network (VPN) for internet access, which Wang said can be very slow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international students in China, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students cannot access Google </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or any affiliated websites like Google Docs due to restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have two other CCS physics students who I’m pretty close with, they’re both from China and they did both decided to stay [in the U.S.], and the main reason for them was that they had to deal with the firewall and probably more restrictions in China,” Zheng said, adding that it was a “50-50” split between friends of his who decided to stay in California and who decided to leave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng also said there’s been a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school and his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel disconnected from my friends, most of my friends are in the United States, so I mean, they call and they would do homework together, so sometimes they’ll be calling while I’m sleeping, so I do notice that I connect with them a lot less than when I’m back in school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a huge difference between trying to connect with a person through a video call than hanging out in person.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main uncertainty that lies ahead for Wang is fall quarter’s hybrid scenario. She said she’ll be staying in I.V. regardless of whether courses are conducted remotely or not because she wants to experience her senior year there. But she added that a concern for many international students is paying international tuition while missing out on in-person educational benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For out-of-state and international students, we pay a lot more for tuition. With the whole online situation, all these changes are already unfair for all the students, but I think it’s even more unfair for international students and out-of-states.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he doesn’t know exactly when he’ll be back in the U.S. But of all the challenges he’s faced this quarter, he said the most difficult and ongoing challenge is the uncertainty that lies ahead for his education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not saying I’m worried about living or anything like that, but mostly learning.

Tuition and fees for fall will also remain unchanged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang also said that any student who wishes to continue learning entirely remotely will be given the option to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the email stated that the school would be updating procedures as new safety protocols are released and is “thinking creatively” about face-to-face interaction, currently “all courses with an enrollment of more than 50 students will require remote instruction,” Yang stated in the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, classes with less than 50 students have no guarantee of in-person instruction, which will be limited to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small classes, seminars and some arts and performance courses and labs. Decisions about final course formats will be announced in July, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that the plans for fall quarter instruction are not final, and that the university is working to “develop more face-to-face course offerings.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also currently planning for all undergraduate residence halls to be limited to double occupancy — with the possibility of limiting rooms to single occupants — reducing the number of housing spaces available to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All students who will be living in campus residences during the 2020-21 school year will be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test and the school will be implementing additional safety policies, including limiting social interactions for the first two weeks, enforcing a no-visitor policy and asking students not to travel away from campus during the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student housing will not be impacted by the new social distancing practices and most graduate seminars will be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the hybrid class arrangement, tuition and student fees will not be reduced “r</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">egardless of the method of instruction,” following policies set by the University of California Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university plans to provide both remote and in-person campus life activities as well as co-curricular programming. These activities will be contingent on new safety practices,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including requiring masks to be worn at all times, performing daily health checks before entering campus, and following social distancing guidelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also detailed plans to “bring student-athletes back to campus in preparation for fall competition and the academic year … in alignment with the NCAA’s resocialization action plan for college sports.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang informed students of coronavirus-related research being piloted by UCSB faculty, including “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research surveillance testing study</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using a CRISPR-based detection system that is designed to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals,” currently in the development stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus is also putting in place a structure that will enable the testing of campus community members who show symptoms of COVID-19 with traditional qPCR testing,” the email continued, also stating that UCSB will be “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working closely with local public health officials, and will be supporting Public Health’s efforts to conduct contact tracing of campus community members who test positive for COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also planning to ramp up in-person research projects and “ultimately to get all on-campus research projects underway again at effective levels, while still reducing the number of people working on campus during the pandemic,” Yang wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff not involved in approved on-campus research and currently working from home will continue to work remotely from home during the summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

underrepresented group enrollment at the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses of the University of California immediately falling by more than 60 percent and systemwide underrepresented group enrollment falling by at least 12 percent. Underrepresented group high school graduates faced substantial long-term declines in educational and employment outcomes as a result of these changes,” the amendment read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/june20/b1.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by Napolitano’s office on Monday, the “UC has not kept pace with the diversity of students in California K-12 schools or with the overall California population.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The percentage of underrepresented groups graduating high school in California had nearly doubled to upwards of 56% in 2016, the memo states, while the percentage of underrepresented groups in the UC freshman class peaked at 37% in the same year – “an increase that can be attributed to the increase in enrollment across all UC undergraduate campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It makes little sense to exclude any consideration of race in admissions when the aim of the University’s holistic process is to fully understand and evaluate each applicant through multiple dimensions,” UC President Janet Napolitano said in a press release sent out Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Proposition 209 has forced California public institutions to try to address racial inequality without factoring in race, even where allowed by federal law,” Napolitano wrote in the press release. “The diversity of our university and higher education institutions across California, should — and must — represent the rich diversity of our state.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

So a little less traditional archiving for community archives,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force is working with Matt Stahl, the university archivist, on the COVID-19 archives project. Stahl said archives focus traditionally on documents like administrative records; while Stahl and Force plan to collect UCSB announcements and official documents related to the coronavirus pandemic, the focus for this project is to provide a community perspective of life during the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-digital aspect of the project adds a greater degree of access for the UCSB community, many of whom are scattered across the country, to safely participate in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a google form on the </span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-covid-19-community-archives-project-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University Library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website, interested participants can answer questions about their coronavirus stories –– where they are waiting out the pandemic, how they have been impacted and how the pandemic has changed their perspective on life — all while remaining anonymous.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions could be anything from YouTube videos about a day in the life during the coronavirus pandemic to photographs of an empty UCSB campus to personal blogs, but the possibilities for submissions are limitless, Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows for a safe place for self-expression and catharsis,” Force said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Force, the role of documenting UCSB history during the coronavirus pandemic goes beyond simply archiving — preserving the experiences of individuals during the pandemic is an essential piece to recovering and surviving it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re kind of acting as cultural heritage first responders. We’re responding to moments of tragedy and crisis in a different way than the frontline medical professionals do,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re offering a way to preserve people’s stories and truths, not only for evidentiary value but for self edification to capture historical moments at its most raw and unfiltered form.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl pointed to other examples of when UCSB archive projects were used as a response to community crises, like the</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/isla-vista-memorial-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isla Vista Memorial Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The COVID-19 archives project parallels the memorial project because both projects ask fundamental questions of “how are people dealing with trauma,” and “how does the UCSB community deal with trauma,” Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 archives project has been accepting submissions through its website since May 14, but there is no set deadline for the closure of submissions.

The new resolution will require the Internal Vice President to read a land recognition before every senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Esme Quintero-Cubillan, who was the first author on both resolutions, said her conversations with Mia Lopez, UCSB’s American Indian Student Association (AISA) tribal liaison, inspired her to write a resolution that was a “call to action” as well as a recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the public forum, students expressed the importance of representation for Indigenous students, who make up only 1% of the school’s population. Jeike Meijer, UCSB’s 2018-2019 External Vice President for Local Affairs and an Indigenous student, called on senators to do more for Indigenous communities in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A couple of minutes at the beginning of a senate meeting is so small, if you think about it, and as student leaders your platforms said that you aim to represent minorities and more minority groups. And this seems literally like the most tiny way that you can do that,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate passed a second resolution on Friday condemning the United States’ “inadequate response” to the conditions of the Navajo Nation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Navajo Nation is currently experiencing an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-03/la-na-navajo-nation-coronavirus-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infection rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is higher than New York City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said the resolution also focuses on how the government “left [behind] the Navajo Nation” and “how they failed to provide for them” amidst a pandemic. The resolution details how the Navajo Nation has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and ensures the A.S. Senate will “continue to support the Navajo Nation through advocacy, awareness, and however stipulated by indigenous advocates.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were promised $8 million in aid, yet were only supplied body bags. And I really tried to hit home the idea that America genuinely does not care about Indigenous lives or Indigenous voices,” Quintero-Cubillan continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Quintero-Cubillan and Meijer emphasized the importance of holding the University of California (UC) accountable for harming indigenous communities, including the UC’s role in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/thirty-meter-telescope-has-received-68m-from-uc-in-past-six-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding the Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Hawaii which is planned to be built on sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“America is occupied land. People were forcibly removed, there was genocide. We’re still living with those impacts today. We’re still living with the trauma.

Many people at the demonstration condemned Yang for his empty words and his failure to show up that day. Others referenced the lawsuits filed against the UC Police Department (UCPD) on the Santa Barbara campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May 2019, the Nexus reported that there were three active lawsuits against current and former members of the UCPD. Since then, more current and former officers have filed their own lawsuits. There are currently </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six active lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lawsuits allege serious misconduct by police officers within the department, including widespread racism and sexism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the university has failed to publicly address these lawsuits, or student concerns that stemmed from learning about them. Students, staff and faculty did not hear a single public assurance that these lawsuits or the misconduct alleged in them would be independently investigated, or that the department would be making any internal changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we did get were stories from The Current, the public relations arm of the university, </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new police chief, James Brock, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apparent changes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was making to the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus tried to interview Brock after he was first hired in April 2019 and after The Current published a </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about his “open-door policy” and “the importance of creating relationships with students and building trust between the student body and the department,” we were stonewalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any emails we sent to Brock were either ignored or directed to the public affairs department, who told us that Brock was too busy to speak with us directly and that we should email our questions to them, despite us emailing numerous times over the course of a month and offering flexibility in interview times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits are also not being dealt with publicly. Despite continuously reaching out to the lawyers, the Nexus has not been able to learn much about the progress of any internal mediations. As of April 2020, the university has been conducting an internal investigation into the allegations, according to a lawyer representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, the student body knows very little about what is happening within the UCSB Police Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December, Yang announced the </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2019-12-02-police-advisory-board\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Police Advisory Board. A memo about the board’s creation was posted to the Office of the Chancellor website, but there was no campus-wide email sent to the student body. Despite its goal of “enhanc[ing] communication between the police department and the campus community,” not a single email has been sent to students about the board’s progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers across the nation are protected by a lack of transparency and accountability within the criminal justice system that the UC and UCSB are perpetuating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yang wants to condemn and address the effects of police misconduct, he needs to start on this campus. Start by being transparent with the student body about what changes were made after the lawsuits were filed and about the disciplinary records of all the officers within the department. Students on this campus deserve to know who is policing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond UCSB, the UC system as a whole needs to do more. UC President Janet Napolitano and Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez sent out a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-protests-violence-following-george-floyd-s-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sunday condemning the recent racist killings of Black people and committing to “re-examine our own practices and ensure we continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing that we established two years ago.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC student journalist, Gabe Schneider, recently published an article titled “</span><a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/uc-campuses-have-disclosed-virtually-no-records-under-police-transparency-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Campuses Have Disclosed Virtually No Records Under Police Transparency Law,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that drew attention to how little transparency there is within UC police departments across the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schneider noted that the UC system “is aware of more than 200 incidents involving police use of force on its 10 campuses in recent years. Nearly half of those incidents resulted in the injury of an officer or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet only two police use of force case files have been released publicly,” Schneider wrote.                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s despite California Senate Bill 1421, a landmark transparency law that went into effect last year. It requires police to turn over internal records involving police shootings and use of force, and instances of sexual assault or lying by on-duty officers,” Schneider continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC needs to release these records, and it needs to be more transparent with students about the misconduct within its police departments. It is not enough to write platitudes in a statement, and it is certainly not enough to say that the UC will “continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing” without explaining what those steps will look like, and how students will directly be impacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system and UCSB cannot claim to condemn these acts of police violence across the nation while simultaneously shielding records of misconduct within its own police departments. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We

for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some graduate students are saying that it is unclear how many students — faced with the cost associated with an extra year of study — will utilize this offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just hard to get a sense of where people are at and it’s also hard to get a sense of how your research is impacted,” Alexander LeBrun, Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and representative to the Graduate Council, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Graduate Council is allowing three additional quarters for time-to-degree and time-to-candidacy, no additional funding is guaranteed, according to the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18opTv7ABHar4PsMKTCg2AI0tkMKMlIeZ9Amxp8yPPuw/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQ sheet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the extension was offered to every graduate student, the Graduate Division expects “many, if not most, students will be able to meet their milestones and complete their degrees following the normal timelines,” according to the FAQ sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LeBrun says it’s “hard to quantify” how many students could take advantage of this extension but hopes it will benefit those experiencing </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-05/as-in-person-research-goes-dormant-ucsb-researchers-explore-new-methods-of-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a halt to their research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other facets of their graduate study because of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mostly, I’m thinking of people who work in labs,” he said. “There’s only a handful of labs that are currently open, and those are the essential, and also COVID-related, labs. And soon we’re going to be opening a couple more [labs], but that doesn’t account for enough graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year-long extension will also not apply to graduate student housing, which LeBrun says is already “not prioritized” by the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there’s too many grad students and not enough housing, it seems like we’ll just have to find stuff in the community,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a third-year Philosophy Ph.D student, LeBrun doesn’t do field research or work in a lab, but said that the humanities and social sciences are still impacted by the pandemic and that those graduate students may need more time to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even me, who just sits at home and does my research, I’m being impacted,” he said. “My mental health is impacting my ability to do my research. It’s so hard to concentrate on arcane, philosophical questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest determining factors for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding –– which LeBrun says remains uncertain for many due to budget limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the “time extensions will allow students to maintain funding eligibility,” according to the Graduate Division FAQ sheet, the time extension “[does] not guarantee an availability of additional funding.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for graduate students, determined either by their department as teaching assistants or research assistants, covers their tuition and health insurance, and provides a salary, LeBrun says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no guarantee to get funding for that next year. It’s up to either your department if you’re a TA, or your advisor if you’re in research whether they have the resources to pay you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeBrun worries that some graduate students who have no choice but to extend their degree will be forced to take out loans if they don’t receive additional funding from departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s only a limited number of TAships for each department and if you have to give one to a student who has extended their time-to-degree, then that means another student doesn’t get that TAship,” LeBrun said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing funding and housing, in addition to completing their degrees, are stressors to graduate students, who also take on the role of instructors as TAs –– a role that has only grown more difficult since the start of remote learning, LeBrun said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the vote to extend degree timelines, LeBrun says GSA has just been doing “damage control” to help graduate students. Recently, GSA diverted all graduate student fees –– normally used for events during spring quarter –– to a </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 relief grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing over $30,000 of relief to students who are particularly impacted, according to LeBrun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping that a system will be worked out where there’s a pot of money for those [graduate students choosing to extend] to continue to get funding, or at least reduced tuition or something like that.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/","id":1,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[0,-1,-2],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
