The new I.C.E. policy affects students with F-1 or M-1 visas, which are issued to students who are either attending an academic or vocational program respectively, according to the UC press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new policy, international students attending colleges that are offering only online courses in the fall must either transfer to a new college or leave the country, and will face deportation if they do not comply. For schools under a hybrid model, such as the UC system, international students must be enrolled in at least one in-person class in order to stay in the U.S., according to the I.C.E. announcement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC said in the press release that the lawsuit will argue that “ICE failed to follow the Administrative Procedure Act” and “failed to consider both the University’s and students’ reliance interests when it barred international students from attending universities that only offer online courses during the ongoing health crisis.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As part of our effort to respond to COVID-19 and to protect the health of all our students, UC has increased online instruction and decreased in-person classes … so it is imperative for UC to file this lawsuit in order to protect our students,” UC Board of Regents Chair John A.

During the meeting, several Regents highlighted Drake’s extensive history in education, both within and outside the UC system — a sharp contrast to Napolitano, who came to the helm with no academic leadership experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano has served as UC president for the past seven years after previously serving as Secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and governor of Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents approved Drake’s salary at $890,000, according to a UC press release sent after the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents’ search committee held </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/the-uc-should-strive-for-better-students-faculty-and-stakeholders-share-suggestions-for-the-next-uc-president-at-ucla-public-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a> <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town</span></a> <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">halls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at various UC campuses over the 2019-20 academic year during which students called on the Regents to choose a leader who would prioritize climate change and workers’ rights and provide a more equitable environment for all students, faculty and staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his remarks to the Regents, Drake touched upon the challenges for the university, including financial impacts from the coronavirus pandemic, demand for greater diversity and </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-07/academic-council-recommends-uc-to-defund-police-ban-police-firearms/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calls to defund UC police departments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC is among the few institutions worldwide best equipped to meet these challenges. Perhaps not to solve them and not to solve them single handedly, but to be fully engaged in finding solutions,” Drake said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani said that Drake will “steer the UC into a bold new era,” and lauded his experience in handling “budgetary challenges, issues of health and healthcare, racism and inclusion [and] policing and security.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael Drake’s commitment to graduate and undergraduate students, to the work of faculty, to understanding the centrality of all UC employees along with his very deep commitment to social mobility, is a joy to encounter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake attended Stanford University as an undergraduate, then received a medical degree from UC San Francisco. He served as the fifth chancellor of UC Irvine from 2005 to 2014 and the president of The Ohio State University from 2014 to the present. Drake is also board of governors chairman of the NCAA and a board member for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, according to the UC press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing — vice chair of the presidential search committee — said the competition for the position was steep, but Drake stood above his contenders for his history of innovation and commitment to diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things that was very important to us is somebody who’s ready on day one and Michael brings that quality because of his familiarity with UC,” she said. “When you look at what he did as chancellor [of UC Irvine] and at all the other jobs he had at Ohio State, you see that Michael is bold and he is capable of thinking outside of the box.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Drake’s “illustrious” career in education and a public announcement of retirement, Lansing said she was surprised that he took the position, but amounts it to Drake’s history with the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s doing this job simply because he loves UC.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Shortly after the assault, Roe filed a police report with the Santa Barbara Police Department according to the motion, as well as a Title IX complaint one year later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, the Title IX office found Doe responsible for sexually assaulting Roe in 2015 and in violation of the UC’s sexual misconduct policies, according to the motion. In November 2017, the university sanctioned Doe with a three-year suspension and ruled he would be allowed to return in November 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe subsequently filed his petition to vacate the Title IX findings in January 2018, according to the motion. When he filed his petition to vacate the Title IX office’s findings in 2018, which was heard by the superior court, the court approved his petition and dismissed the findings in April 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the latest motion filed on June 9, Adams argues that the superior court only heard evidence from John Doe and the university when Doe filed his petition, but not from Roe or Roe’s lawyers. In addition, Roe had no knowledge that her case had been reopened nor that the superior court had ruled to vacate the Title IX office’s findings, according to Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”This is really not about Jane Roe. This is about all of the survivors out there who are completely left out of this process,” she added. “I’ve actually never heard of a situation in which they have included and notified the survivor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adams said this case speaks to the larger issue of due process and the misrepresentation of survivors in Title IX cases, of which there have been at least </span><a href=\"https://www.titleixforall.com/milestone-600-title-ix-due-process-lawsuits-in-behalf-of-accused-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">600 lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed on behalf of accused students in attempts to overturn their respective schools’ findings of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can absolutely say that the reason victims are left out of these cases is because the assailant or the accused person does not include them in the lawsuit,” Adams said. “So it is quite ironic to me that respondents in these cases are crying out for due process and then simultaneously robbing survivors, like our client, of the same in these cases.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roe’s motion is set to be heard in July, she said, but the other parties, Doe and the university, have a chance to respond to the motion before it is heard by a judge. Adams said she expects Doe to oppose the motion but is unsure if the university will follow suit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A big question will be whether the school will oppose our motion,” Adams said. “We would hope that the school would agree with us, that all students who are involved in these cases are entitled to notice of these filings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university declined to comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Hathaway, who represents Doe, did not respond to multiple requests for comment but provided to the Daily Nexus a copy of Doe’s opposition to motion to vacate, which was filed on June 18 in response to Doe’s previous motion to vacate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposition to motion to vacate alleges that the UC Regents “failed to provide a Title IX process that complied with California law” and argues that because neither Doe nor Roe are currently UCSB students, the matter is “moot” and does not require anymore administrative proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July’s hearing, the judge will decide whether or not to grant Roe’s motion, which could reverse the superior court’s previous decision to vacate the Title IX findings, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the judge doesn’t motion to vacate, Doe’s petition will stand and he would remain absolved from the Title IX findings. But if the judge does motion to vacate, Doe’s petition would be void and the original Title IX findings against Doe would stand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All parties — Doe, Roe and UCSB — will have the chance to appeal the judge’s upcoming July decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of any motion to appeal, from either party, has the potential to set legal precedent; the decision could determine how future cases define “real parties in interests,” which is a </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/real_party_in_interest\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">term</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to describe a person or entity who will be impacted by the outcome of legal action even if they are not explicitly defined as a party in the case, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should the court of appeals rule “that all survivors are real parties in interests who are entitled to notice of petition filings” and legal action, a new precedent could be set, which would mandate that all survivors in Title IX cases be included in future cases, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Roe been included as a real party in interest, Roe would have been notified when Doe filed his petition and when the court vacated the Title IX findings, Adams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement to the Nexus, Roe described how she felt excluded from the legal proceedings that voided the responsibility of sexual assault from her assaliant and emphasized the importance of changing the legal landscape to uplift — and include — the survivors’ voices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being excluded from the court’s legal proceedings made me feel like my voice had been completely taken away. It felt like the court didn’t care about my experience, and was just handing over the power and narrative of my story to my attacker,” Roe said. “I had no way to defend myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been about 5 years since my assault, and it feels ridiculous that I’m still fighting for my voice to be heard. But it’s important for me to know that I am also fighting for the rights of other survivors as well,” she said. “That’s why I want my story to make a difference.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-94880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured a panel of five prominent speakers. </span>Courtesy<em> of UCHRI</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured prominent speakers such as Angela Davis, a professor emerita at UC Santa Cruz and a renowned political activist; Herman Gray, a professor emeritus at UC Santa Cruz; Gaye Theresa Johnson, a professor of African American studies at UC Los Angeles; Robin D. G. Kelley, a professor of African American studies and American history at UC Los Angeles; and Josh Kun, a professor of communication and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar began with a discussion about the meaning of the phrase “I can’t breathe,” a phrase associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and some of the last words from </span><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Floyd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/23/559498678/i-can-t-breathe-explores-life-and-death-at-the-hands-of-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric Garner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two Black men who were both killed by white police officers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gray highlighted the phrase’s dual meaning, both as a symbol of environmental racism experienced by Black people and the product of illegal choke holds used by law enforcement to detain Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think about breath in terms of environment and polluted air and the environmental degradation that Black and brown people have to live through,” Gray said. “Breathe and breathing as the terms to understand the devastating health impact of the pandemic of COVID-19, which disproportionately attacks Black and brown people, particularly around respiratory systems in urban populations and older populations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath also expresses the constricted air available to Black men, women and children at the hands of police, through illegal tactics like choke holds and knees to the neck,” he continued. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath is constricted because of the stresses and strains that parents, grandparents, partners, whose daily life is often relegated to overcrowded and under resourced conditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson discussed the role of the protests in inciting change and how the ongoing struggle for equality is representative of “a different kind of calculus of human work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of the things that are happening right now, while they are incredibly concerning, they are also, as we all know, incredibly hopeful and powerful,” Johnson continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation shifted from domestic movements to international ones, Davis discussed the global response to police brutality and racial inequality. She highlighted her experiences with academics and activists from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which she said suffers from not only discrimination and violence from the police, but also an extreme militarization of its police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation state [in America], as we know it, is no longer possible, and so a broad international perspective not only helps us to imagine solidarity but to think about what kind of future we want,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we say ‘abolish prisons,’ when we say ‘abolish the police,’ we are thinking about a future in which we will have moved beyond the bourgeois capitalist notion of the nation state,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Davis, Kelley revisited the development of the nation state and its efforts to facilitate racial inequality as a “repressive arm” that asserts control through “police power [and] military power,” he said, especially during times of unrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In responding to Davis’ comments about dismantling the nation state, Kelley said Davis is “laying out a vision of internationalism, which is in some ways the beginnings of a global vision that focuses on the conditions of the least of us, that creates the conditions of life for working people around the globe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things about this moment we’re in now is that it is deeply international, it’s deeply multiracial, it is broad, and … it builds on a decade of struggles that Black Lives Matter, in particular, has laid out,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Kelley, Johnson spoke about how the rise of authoritarianism and policing in America speaks to the fragility of white supremacy, and how those who support the nation state are reinforcing the “master narrative,” which Johnson described as the belief that the inequalities Americans face are unique to this country. That, however, is untrue, Johnson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even when you hear people who are liberals talk about, ‘Oh I can’t believe this is happening in our country and everybody is hurting, I can’t believe we’re in these times.’ These times have always been here,” Johnson said. “The only thing that has changed, is again, we’ve had enough.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis added that unlike past movements, especially those that predate the digital era of citizen journalism — the phenomenon in which ordinary bystanders or witnesses to an event can record and share those events through social media — the public reaction to the death of George Floyd has been met with </span><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/george-floyd-protests-world-racism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense and widespread emotion.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was something about the witnessing of George Floyd’s last breaths that has become a collective phenomenon. We’ve all been transformed because we’ve all seen the last nine minutes of this brother’s life,” Davis said. “That emotional connection has been very much lacking in our movements prior to the more recent era.”    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis also said that the feminist intersection of organizing movements for Black lives often goes unrecognized, although the </span><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/our-co-founders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Lives Matter movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with many others, was founded and run by Black women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelley applauded the efforts of Black women in organizing demonstrations — citing one that took place just outside his house on Beverly Boulevard. “All they have is a face mask,” he said, highlighting the fact that many Black female activists are risking their lives to organize demonstrations in the wake of the coronavirus, which </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disproportionately affects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to leading movements, Kelley said some people still subscribe to the ideology that “what the movement needs is the male leader.” Although people still hold onto that idea, he said, “I think it’s dying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation drew to a close, Kun spoke to the momentum of the ongoing worldwide movements for Black lives and the unprecedented intensity by which society is demanding change. He warned, however, that this intensity will die down, but that it’s imperative to avoid compressing “longitudinal” movements — those that span months or years — into a week of protests, which can damage their longevity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is impressed with the progress already made by movements for Black lives, and “the extent to which notions of systemic racism, structural racism, institutional racism [have] thoroughly permeated the mainstream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an extremely important moment because [the] work that we’ve been doing for such a long time … seems to be reaching a kind of fruition,” she said. “But I’m especially interested in Black Lives Matter — the negative responses that first occurred when the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ emerged in the context of the Ferguson protests.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So many people were saying, ‘Shouldn’t all lives matter?’ But I think now people are beginning to get it,” she said. “And I’ve seen a lot of signs that say ‘All lives will not matter until Black lives matter.’”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Office of the President, the UC has invested $38 million into the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) through donations from the </span><a href=\"https://www.moore.org/home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (GBMF) and another $30 million directly from its own funds in the past six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The financial report was obtained through a California Public Records Act from the campus activist organization Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Berkeley in early May and details the UC’s history of contributions to TMT from October 2014 to February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But until recently, public knowledge surrounding the UC’s use of its own funds for the roughly </span><a href=\"https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/03/17/hawaii-news/thirty-meter-telescope-cost-estimate-increases-to-2-4b/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> telescope project has been largely speculative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an </span><a href=\"http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar14/f4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the March 2014 Board of Regents meeting, the UC and Caltech agreed to split a $250 million pledge from GBMF and to jointly raise an additional $100 million from their own funds. The UC said in the action item that it planned to raise its half of the share — $50 million — through “philanthropic support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But funding directly from the UC has come from a variety of other sources, including reallocated funding from another observatory project, the UC’s department of Research and Graduate Studies and “systemwide funds,” which are used “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for an array of purposes including teaching and research,” Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC, said in an email to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees, however, are not included in the UC’s contributions to TMT, according to UC Spokesperson Claire Doan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC had contributed to TMT solely through grants from GBMF from October 2014 until October 2016, when it made a $10 million contribution to TMT using its own funds, according to the financial report. The $10 million contribution was one of the largest donations listed on the financial report, second to a $13,883,525 contribution made that same month from GBMF grant funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the UC has continued to make contributions with its own funds in varying amounts — some as small as $126 in September 2017 and others as large as $5 million, which it paid out four separate times in June 2018, November 2018, August 2019 and February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The timing of the UC’s February 2020 contribution to TMT also came less than a month after UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez said at the Board’s January meeting that he intended to facilitate a discussion about the UC’s involvement with the project, The Daily Californian </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/05/22/uc-invests-68m-into-thirty-meter-telescope-on-maunakea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the activist organization Uprooted &amp; Rising said at a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uprootedandrising/videos/920585268346863/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 21 that the UC has not engaged in any discussions surrounding its involvement in the project. Many students spoke at a public forum during the May 21 Board of Regents virtual Zoom meeting, asking the Regents to divest from TMT and echoing the demands of an </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Student Association in September 2019 calling on the UC to cut financial ties with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite ongoing friction from UC students who contest TMT’s development on Native Hawaiian land, the UC maintains that it is “deeply committed” to respecting the environment and culture surrounding Mauna Kea and has collaborated with the Hawaiian community “to address a range of cultural, environmental, educational and economic issues,” Holbrook wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major and an organizer for the Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Santa Barbara, “this investment is making a very big statement about [the UC’s] lack of support for Indigenous and Hawaiian students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said many students are frustrated with the UC because they feel that their opposition to TMT has gone ignored and that the UC’s opacity with the project is a disservice to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the UC Board of Regents virtual meeting from May 19-21, Meijer said she and Terrill James Kaneali‘i Williams, an Indigeneous Hawaiian graduate student from UC Riverside, were promised an opportunity to speak during public forum; after speaking first, Meijer said the Board of Regents did not call on Kaneali‘i Williams to speak, even though “they promised two days in a row to call [on] him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating because there’s no other way for him to get to talk to the board because it’s all virtual now. And it felt like they were silencing him,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was really frustrating for me because I’m Indigenous, but I’m not Hawaiian. And we were banking on having the Hawaiian voice be there,” she added. “So it’s really challenging with these virtual Board of Regents meetings because they can choose to just not call [on] people and that seems to be what they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students have voiced their concerns regarding TMT in a variety of ways, including a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December with Native Hawaiian activists, </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to condemn the university’s involvement and meetings with Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who currently chairs TMT’s board of governors. Despite his title, Yang maintains that his role in TMT </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is miniscule. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these concerns, Mejier is also worried about the environmental aspects of TMT. Mauna Kea is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture and is home to multiple endangered </span><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/ENDANGERED/bulletin/2002/03-06/22-23.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wildlife species</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that cannot be found anywhere else on earth, she said. Should TMT continue building the telescope, it may put Mauna Kea’s unique ecosystems at risk, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kealoha Pisciotta, </span><a href=\"http://kahea.org/blog/mk-vignette-kealoha-pisciotta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">founder</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the protest group Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, said during the Uprooted &amp; Rising press conference in May that Native Hawaiians have been pleading to Gordon and Betty Moore for years to stand with them to protect Mauna Kea. Over a decade since TMT broke ground, she said, their calls have still been unanswered and the Native Hawaiian elders — known as kupunas — are still on the frontlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only way to do this project is they’re going to have to hurt people,” Pisciotta said, “because the kupunas are willing to die.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Both the decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy were made under this policy, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas,” Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee, said in the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also noted in the press release that the journey to divestment took a significant step when the UC sold off its investments in coal and oil sands one year after the UC Investment Office adopted the ESG policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to concern from investors about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on fossil fuel stock prices, Bachher said in the press release that the UC’s divestment represents an important turning point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we certainly could not have predicted the speed nor depth of the recent downturn in the traditional energy sector, signs point to a structural shift — not merely another cycle of boom or bust,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also said in the press release that the “lowered demand and oversupply” of fossil fuels “could portend an even longer price drought in oil and gas” as the world recovers from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the UC investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology associated with these goals, the press release stated. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” </span><em>Courtesy of Regents Livestream</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Special Committee, which was created in 2018 to produce recommendations on basic needs for UC students, heard from UC Basic Needs Committee Co-Chairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Galarneau and Ruben Canedo, who presented about the coronavirus pandemic’s economic and social toll on the UC and its students before going on to review recommendations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can now visibly see how income levels, ethnicity, family structure, citizenship status and access to healthcare affect student’s access to education and their mental health,” a UC San Diego student observer said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And those disparities have definitely been visible when it comes to basic needs resources,” the student observer continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yvette Gullatt, vice provost for Diversity and Engagement and chief outreach officer for the University of California, said the special committee is concerned with both “articulat[ing] our concerns while also moving forward” and has delayed discussion about its recommendations for the UC Regents September meeting, when the committee would be evaluating how pertinent their recommendations have proven to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One goal of the new recommendations is to “advocate for greater investment in financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” Paired with the timing of the coronavirus pandemic, additional financial aid could serve to reduce the financial burden many UC students are currently experiencing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has currently been allocated $260 million through the federal C.A.R.E.S. act, $130 million of which was allocated to campuses for the distribution of emergency grants for students, according to Director of Student Financial Support Shawn Brick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Student Regent Hayley Wheddle, the head of the Special Committee, spearheaded the basic needs report over her year-long term; Tuesday’s meeting was her last as a student regent. She commended the UC on “proactively looking to fill the gaps” in financial aid, as the committee aims to push federal funding going forward, according to the committee’s draft recommendations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the meeting, presenters and speakers emphasized the need to utilize CalFresh, which can now be used to purchase online groceries, and the possibility of waiving the 20-hour per-week work requirements that are usually necessary to qualify for the food assistance program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their drafted recommendations emphasized the importance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximizing overall enrollment in CalFresh through “running large-scale onsite CalFresh enrollment clinics,” as well as “training county departments of social services workers to support UC students with CalFresh application and enrollment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the committee hopes to assist students who are not eligible for CalFresh with various on-campus programs and aims to close the 22% gap in food insecurity between first-generation and non-first-generation students, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campuses have been made responsible for UC students who are now, due to moving back to their hometowns, closer to a different UC campus than the one that they are enrolled in. According to the committee Co-Chair Tim Galarneau,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> UC students can receive certain services on any given campus such as meal swipes, bagged grocery pickup, temporary housing and emergency grants regardless of which campus they’re enrolled at.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because of the coronavirus pandemic, Galarneau said, many campuses are inherently under-equipped for “daily uncertainties and major changes to resources, policies, processes, and decision making” as a result of limited staffing and uncertainty surrounding future funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With basic needs providers on college campuses designated as first responders to the coronavirus pandemic, the Special Committee on Basic Needs hopes to address the challenges the UC is facing with help from local campuses and their basic needs providers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our basic needs movement is a nascent one, coinciding with natural disasters and a pandemic, coinciding when food security and a sense of community have been needed the most,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gullatt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is changing as the needs of students change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UC President Janet Napolitano, follows the path of a number of institutions across the country that have gone </span><a

As the largest university system in the nation to eliminate the test, the UC’s decision will likely have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 2025 onward, California applicants will be judged by a new testing standard to assess knowledge that “better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values,” Napolitano’s report read. No decision has been made yet for out-of-state and international students, who might continue using the SAT and ACT or be judged by the UC’s future standardized test assessment, the details of which have yet to be determined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new test has not been implemented by 2025, the testing requirement for California students will be eliminated altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to move in a careful and studied way to the new future for the University … a better test should be what we aim for in California,” Napolitano told the Regents, saying one goal in the creation of a new test is to help strengthen college preparedness in California high schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also want to work …  to analyze and drill down into factors that contribute to disproportionate representation, or rather underrepresentation, of students from underserved communities in our population. We are a public university after all,” Napolitano told the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2022 application cycles, the SAT and ACT will be optional. This is partially due to the cancellation of tests due to the coronavirus but extends the optional period to two years instead of the original one-year extension as approved by the Regents in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2023 and 2024 application cycles, admissions will be “test blind.” Students may submit an SAT or ACT score for reasons other than admissions, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC, according to Napolitano’s recommendation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano acknowledged that the new testing assessment might draw on other standardized tests. In her comments, she mentioned that the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states, could be fitted for college admission testing in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was debate among the regents over whether to continue use of the ACT and SAT while a new test was in the works, a similar line of reasoning to that of the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, where the task force recommended keeping the ACT and SAT in place until a replacement test is finalized.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/06/groups-demand-university-california-stop-using-satact-scores-admissions-alleging-tests-discriminate-against-underprivileged-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/is-sat-test-going-down-at-uc-several-uc-regents-express-deep-skepticism-over-use-in-admissions-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the years have shared the attitude that both income and race are indicators of success on standardized tests, with an industry developing around years-long preparation and some beginning as early as middle school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the UC to eliminate the test in admissions.

Now, Title IX will only apply to sexual violence that occurs in university-owned off-campus buildings or “any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution,” such as a fraternity or sorority house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university owns and leases a handful of apartment buildings in Isla Vista, as well as 910 Embarcadero Del Mar, the site of Dublin’s Sports Grill and Precious Slut Tattoo Parlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that the “vast majority” of gender-based violence cases that C.A.R.E. sees occur in off-campus housing in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really concerned that there’s going to be cases that would have been eligible for Title IX [that] will no longer be eligible for those investigations,” Conway said in a phone interview. “But [I.V. is] just one less area that offenders can be accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, survivors of sexual assault can still report to local law enforcement such as the UC Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, or seek counseling from organizations like C.A.R.E., but will not be able to report the incident to the Title IX office if the sexual assault took place in I.V., Conway said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while university-sanctioned fraternity and sorority houses are officially recognized buildings within Title IX’s scope, the new regulations leave areas like fraternity satellite houses out of the university’s jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The new regulations] wouldn’t include those spaces … That’s really dangerous for our community, especially because we have so much off-campus housing that is not owned by the university,” said Alia Reynolds, the director of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said that the jurisdiction restrictions are a “ridiculous standard” that will impact safety in I.V.; the I.V. CSD board </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-15/i-v-csd-condemns-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protested the amendments in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> submitted to the Department of Education during the public comment period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you create a policy that requires the university to sort of draw a line around the areas where they have jurisdiction to investigate sexual violence and which areas that they do not, you are, by definition, discouraging survivors from coming forward and using the judicial tools that should be at their disposal to seek justice,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations also narrow the definition of sexual violence as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” — a definition first established by the 1999 Supreme Court case</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had not previously been used as Title IX’s definition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, under Obama-era policy, an incident had to be either severe, pervasive or objectively offensive to qualify as sexual harassment; under the new regulations, an incident must be considered all three in order to be under the umbrella of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said that the change from “or” to “and” may seem small, but the language change makes a large difference in what may be considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That would essentially mean that the instance [of sexual violence] — because it has to be severe and pervasive and objectively offensive — has to happen more than one time, which is the definition of pervasive. So it excludes a lot of instances of sexual harassment [with] this new definition,” Reynolds explained. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710641/PACAOS-Appendix-E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the UC Title IX policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, first-time occurences of dating violence, stalking and domestic violence are still included in the definition of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, universities will have to choose a universal evidentiary standard for handling sexual assault, either with the preponderance of the evidence standard or with the clear and convincing evidence standard for all cases. Previously, schools could use different standards in different cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preponderance of evidence standard requires that there is a 50.1% chance that the charges are true, while the clear and convincing evidence standard requires a higher threshold of 75.1%, according to Conway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Systemwide Title IX Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding which standard the university will use moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges and universities are also no longer required to designate most employees, such as professors or staff, as “mandatory reporters,” meaning they will no longer be required to report an incident of sexual violence to the Title IX office if they are informed of it. Instead, schools must now decide “which of their employees must, may, or must only with a student’s consent, report sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator,” according to the new regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes the change will lower the amount of cases reported but said that in her opinion, this particular addition to the Title IX policy isn’t entirely negative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some individuals disclose an instance of sexual assault to someone that they didn’t realize was a mandated reporter. And then those instances are reported and they wish they hadn’t been,” Reynolds explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mandatory reporters are essential to connecting students to the C.A.R.E. office, Conway said. She’s worried that this change will erase the work of faculty in connecting students to the services C.A.R.E. offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because you don’t have to report doesn’t mean it’s not the right thing to do to get that survivor connected with the resources and with an advocate,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, colleges can no longer use the single-investigator model — in which an investigator writes a report and concludes the case, but no hearing takes place — to investigate an incident of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under current California law, however, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-california-universities-title-ix-20190215-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities haven’t used the single-investigator model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since January 2019. Prior to January 2019, hearings of Title IX cases in California were conducted only in the appeal process, by either the complainant or the respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations permit live cross-examination of the complainant and the respondent by advisers and lawyers, but prohibits complainants and respondents from questioning each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marks a significant change from DeVos’ initial proposed policy in November 2018, which did allow for students to cross-examine each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that a downside to the hearing method, rather than the single-investigator method, is that cases will take longer to conclude, which, along with the additional trauma of a cross-examination, could further deter students from reporting. Conway said that while more students are accessing C.A.R.E. accessing than ever, she has already seen fewer C.A.R.E. clients choosing to go through the Title IX investigation process since the 2019 change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since DeVos’ announcement, several groups across the country have already pledged to fight the regulations in court, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-announces-new-rules-on-campus-sexual-assault-offering-more-rights-to-the-accused/2020/05/06/4d950c7c-8fa0-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Washington Post reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At UC Santa Barbara, student organizations have already started. Reynolds said that S.A.S.A. is working with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit organization for gender justice, and that some S.A.S.A. members are part of a newly formed national coalition against sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to work with them to try to bolster that national coalition so we can fight this on the national level as well as on the state level.” </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/12/2020, 09:21 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that a lower number of students accessing C.A.R.E. resources. This article has been corrected to state that more students are accessing C.A.R.E. resources, but fewer C.A.R.E. clients are choosing to go through Title IX investigation, according to Conway. </i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

race and income are indicators of success on the test. </span><em>Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano is joining a growing group of UC leaders — including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive — who are advocating for the elimination of the ACT and SAT in admissions. As the idea gained traction in recent years, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities across the country</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made testing optional or eliminated it altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the proposal, the ACT and SAT would be optional for two years, with testing requirements eliminated completely for two years after that. Starting in 2025, a “modif[ied] or create[d] test that better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values” will be used, according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proposed for the May 21 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC is unable to modify or create a new test in time for California freshmen applicants in 2025, Napolitano recommends that the UC suspend its testing requirements for California students altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendation specifies that the potential elimination of the ACT and SAT after 2025 only applies to in-state students, and that the UC President will work with the Academic Senate to determine an approach for out-of-state and international students from 2025 onwards. Some potential options include having students take the same assessment as California students or continuing to accept their ACT and SAT scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal follows the UC Academic Senate’s </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive proposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, which found that current standardized testing procedures may be a factor in the underrepresentation of minority groups at UC schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force (STTF) laid out the need for a new testing method, it recommended that the UC continue mandatory testing for now, the opposite of Napolitano’s proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF’s report ultimately concluded that the UC uses standardized tests responsibly and appropriately. Academic Council Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani wrote in an April </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4attach2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Academic Council disagreed with that assessment from the STTF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents announced in March that Fall 2021 admissions would be </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“test optional”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the coronavirus pandemic, which Napolitano now recommends be continued until 2022. Those who don’t submit a score will not be put at a disadvantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023 and 2024, Napolitano recommends that UC admissions be “test blind,” where students can still submit a score, but it would be used for purposes other than selection, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under Napolitano’s proposal, in a sixth-month process beginning in summer 2020 and ending in January 2021, the UC will identify or create a new test by consulting with K-12 educators, test experts, the California State University (CSU) and UC faculty to “construct a test better suited for the needs of UC” for fall 2025 applicants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Napolitano’s recommendation concurs with the STTF to eliminate the SAT Writing test, calling it “an unnecessary time and cost burden for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, one potential option noted by Napolitano is the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF, however, recommended to Napolitano in its report that the UC not use the SBAC test, which they said is aligned to a different set of academic standards than the ACT and SAT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics of the ACT and SAT argue that race and income are indicators of success on the test, and that inequitable access to test prep prevents low-income students and underrepresented minorities from getting high scores. Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">against the UC to eliminate the tests in admissions, calling the tests biased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocates of the SAT and ACT </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-03/uc-should-keep-sat-and-act-as-admission-requirements-faculty-report-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is the only way to determine a student’s academic success across the state, as grading systems vastly differ from school to school. They also argue that the test is only one of fourteen factors in admissions — weighed less than high school grades — so changing the test would not make a significant impact on a student’s admission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will discuss standardized testing in their board meeting on May 21, where they will look at Napolitano’s proposal and Academic Senate recommendations and vote on a plan for standardized testing moving forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

At UC Santa Barbara, for example, that includes an additional $103.50 RecCen2 Expansion fee, a $60.06 UCen Expansion fee and a $39.39 Transit System fee, </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among others.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was at home.

But I was paying for it,” Brandmeyer, a third-year psychology major, said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she is frustrated by the UC’s dismissal of student pleas and petitions — one of which </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made rounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB in March — and for standing its ground on refusing to withhold student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most student fees are relatively small compared to the price of tuition, students who choose to foot the bill with loans will be forced to shell out “thousands and thousands of dollars” down the line as their loans compound, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very unsettled and I think it’s very hypocritical and revealing of what [the UC’s] true motive is,” she said. “At the end of the day, [they] just want to make money off us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC declined to comment on the litigation but </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/university-of-california-announces-no-intention-to-adjust-tuition-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/other-fee-information/payment-refunds.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar </span><a href=\"https://sundial.csun.edu/157547/news/csu-system-sued-for-refusing-to-refund-campus-related-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by a Sonoma State University student against the California State University system on Monday, a spokesperson for the CSU system said it will “vigorously defend against the lawsuit,” EdSource </span><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/students-sue-california-universities-over-fees-lost-amid-pandemic/630377\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said the UC’s ambivalent response in supporting students prompted her to take legal action and “to be the voice” for those who are financially impacted by having their student fees withheld. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re accepted into the University of California, they were like, ‘We’re on your side. We want you to succeed. We want you to do research. We’re here to guide you through your four years,’” Brandemeyer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But the minute you show up,” she added, “it’s kind of like, ‘Okay, well you’re on your own now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking note of the student response to the UC, Garcia said her law firm looked to </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-napolitano-refund-uc-campus-fees-for-spring-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student-generated petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fee reimbursements as a framework for what eventually developed into </span><a href=\"https://dicellolevitt.com/california-university-systems-sued-on-behalf-of-more-than-700000-students-for-refusing-to-refund-fees-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> class-action lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope to achieve the goals that the students have wanted all along,” she said. “If you’ve seen those change.org petitions that were started, there are thousands of students across the country who have signed onto those.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to ensure that the schools will stop charging fees for services that are no longer available and return the funds that they’re holding onto for services that haven’t been provided,” Garcia added. “That money belongs to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the court to make a decision, Garcia maintained that the “goal is ultimately to get the students their money back… no matter how long that takes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she has faith that she will win the lawsuit, noting the outpour of students who are working nearly full-time while balancing a packed schedule amidst the pandemic. With feelings of uncertainty, frustration and desperation in mind, “I think that a lot of people are going to be standing their ground with this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the point where a lot of people are saying enough is enough. [The UC] is saying ‘Oh, we’re saving this money for a rainy day,’” Brandmeyer said. “This is a rainy day.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
