Companies which provide services to the UC through contracting will also be required to comply with the new minimum wage policies. According to a UCOP press release, the cost of the wage increases will be covered by “non-core funds” such as bookstores and food services, which are separate from “core fund” revenue sources, which include tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifth-year sociology major Alberto Perez said the plan benefits full-time UC and UC contract workers, but excludes student workers who typically only work 20 hours per week at most while attempting to provide for tuition and living costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For student workers, the UC has had this kind of unspoken rule that suggests students don’t work over 20 hours because it might cut into their schoolwork and education, which makes sense in most cases,” Perez said. “However, you have … students that need to work at least 20 hours to be in school in the first place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the limitations of the new minimum wage hike and exclusion of certain employees have been overlooked in favor of “positive press” for the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So their motivation is trying to be the beacon of light,” Perez said. “The one minor detail that nobody really covered is that many employees are left out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President of the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW 2865) and graduate student at UC Santa Cruz Robert Cavooris said the UC has good intentions with the minimum wage increase, but the exclusion of many part-time workers is questionable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC trying to encourage workers with this increase is laudable, but the way they are doing it doesn’t really seem to show that they care about all of their workers,” Cavooris said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cavooris, the limitations of the plan are difficult to amend because UC Office of the President (UCOP) is directly in charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know that there are any specific union actions planned, however, we know that when people are together and working together, workers are in a better position to have more power,” Cavooris said. “So this is the best thing we can do to ensure that people get a fair wage and we have power as workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cavooris said unionization will be critical to ensuring worker benefits for all UC employees as the plan develops further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a totally top-down initiative on one level … it also is related to a more general climate of work connectivity across the country which includes the fight for $15 an hour in many industries,” Cavooris said. “We’re organizing ourselves to make sure we can continue to push for things like this in the future, while making sure this doesn’t just apply to a few workers again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year electrical engineering major Himangshu Chowdhury said he thinks the announcement is a step in the right direction, and he hopes more wage increases will follow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think UC has the budget to universally increase wages for every worker at the moment,” Chowdhury said. “Hopefully, as they revise their budget, student workers will see more benefits follow in the near future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the UC would rather hire more workers with fewer hours than take on the costs of an increased minimum wage for part-time employees. Perez also said the wage increase affects him as a part-time employee at Portola dining commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students never will see the $13 hours, and on top of that students will have less to work with, so that’s the concern that I have … a lot students like myself that have to work at least 20 hours to get by,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said if the UC aims to cut costs and students lose the freedom to increase hours, productivity and morale will decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things come up for students, and they will want to have the flexibility to work more … if they can’t, they might quit, causing management to hire more people which we have to train, and thus productivity goes down in general,” Perez said. “Ultimately, I just feel the UCOP put this policy out there without thinking what it means for certain people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64879\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64879\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/","id":2700,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2699,2698,2697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s New Diversity Status Merits $2.6 Million Grant","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara was awarded a $2.6 million grant on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS) after meeting the qualifications of a Hispanic-S...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara was awarded a $2.6 million grant on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS) after meeting the qualifications of a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was named a U.S. Department of Education’s Developing HSI in January by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities because at least 25 percent of its total enrollment is comprised of Hispanic students. The grant for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS), a Title V program, will be distributed over five years and will focus on improving student success and graduation rates by expanding educational opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of Research Development for the Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts in the UCSB Office of Research Barbara Endemaño Walker said the grant will provide access to summer “enrichment” resources such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and the ONDAS Success Center which provide support from community scholars, peer tutoring and a designated study space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ITS we plan to use is ALEKS, which was originally developed at UC Irvine,” Walker said in an email. “It is used at several UC’s, and the UCSB Chemistry Department already uses it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, 10 majors and 41 courses were found to put students at risk of probation and impeded graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Undergraduate students are placed on probation when their cumulative GPA drops below 2.0,” Walker said in an email. “We determined which first year courses (for both freshmen and transfer students) … have a combination of both high enrollment and the lowest final average GPA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the grant will focus on first-year experiences and faculty professional development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It aims] to address the challenges of underrepresented and low-income students in certain majors and to help with the first-year retention rates,” Dela Cruz said. “That, to me, is very important because I come from a low-income community that is certainly underrepresented — I come from Compton.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker said the ONDAS Success Center will remain active after the five-year grant program ends through financial funding sources such as grants, gifts and campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grant will begin this fall,” Walker said in an email. “We will be piloting and ramping up the programs over the next year, and plan to have ONDAS fully operating by fall 2017.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said the grant will improve student life and student representation in “more competitive” majors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I ultimately hope this grant is going to help students of all backgrounds excel in majors where they traditionally have not,” Mirza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dela Cruz said she notices her friends struggling in STEM majors such as chemical engineering and biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of them actually changed their majors,” Dela Cruz said “One of my best friends was on academic probation because she was not excelling in those classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dela Cruz, the grant will address issues impacting minority and marginalized groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By looking specifically at these issues, you are allowing a diverse group of individuals to feel comfortable on this campus,” Dela Cruz said. “You are trying to find alternative ways, creative ways, to make this group of students feel comfortable and make them successful individuals.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mirza said he hopes students as well as administrators will play active roles in deciding how the grant money should best be allocated to aid minority students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, there is a maximum amount of student consultation and outreach in regards to where this money is going to be sent, in particular, with the communities with whom these grants have been issued,” Mirza said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Index is based on the share of students receiving Pell grants, the graduation rate of Pell grant recipients and the net cost after financial aid for low and middle income students. This year’s results led the NYT to call UC “California’s upward mobility machine.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight percent of UCSB students receive Pell grants, with 31 percent also likely to graduate based on past rates, and the net cost for low and middle income students is $14,000.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), University of California Student Association (UCSA) undergraduate chair and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major Mohsin Mirza said NYT’s praise of UC as an “upward mobility machine” is “somewhat incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Students of all incomes struggle with the rising costs of housing and textbooks,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>“While the UC should be praised for the amount of financial aid it provides to low income students, particularly in comparison to other universities, that praise should be tempered with the reality that there is much work to be done.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said while the College Access Index highlights the successes of UC, UCSA will continue to be critical.</p>\n<p>“We see our role as pushing the UC to be the best it possibly can be,” Mirza said. “Praise isn’t effective at creating changes, actions and pressure are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop said she feels UCSB is “very proactive” in creating economic diversity and its high ranking in the College Access Index is a result of outreach efforts that start long before the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“We work closely with high school and community college counselors to spread the word about opportunities available at UCSB,” Przekop said in an email. “We also work with community organizations and early outreach programs to reach younger students and families as they begin to consider college preparation.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, one way UCSB works to serve low-income students is being “visible and available,” providing information that explains the application and financial aid processes and shows low-income families higher education is “a viable pathway to success.”</p>\n<p>“Some families don’t have a history of college attendance and fear that the cost is a barrier to even considering college,” Przekop said in an email. “We have special programs in place to meet the informational needs of first-generation and/or low-income students because they may not have easy access to that information otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said outreach and informational assistance are the only ways UC campuses increase their numbers of Pell-receiving students, because the admissions process itself is “need blind.”</p>\n<p>“Family income cannot be a deciding factor in admitting a student,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the Office of Admissions promotes UCSB at over 600 high schools every fall and chooses campuses with students of all economic backgrounds, leading to greater economic diversity at the university.</p>\n<p>“These schools include those situated in low-income, middle-income, and high-income regions of the state,” Przekop said in an email. “We want students from all backgrounds because we want a diverse learning community.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Pell grant recipient Chance Adkins said while he was surprised UCSB is ranked third in the nation on the College Access Index, he is not surprised it was ranked highly given his experience with financial aid opportunities.</p>\n<p>“I was offered more financial aid here than anywhere else,” Adkins said. “Talking to people who attend other universities, the gap between my financial aid and theirs is higher than one would expect, especially between the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Adkins said while he is glad aid is available when needed, he believes the high number of students receiving Pell grants at UC could explain in part the recent increases in tuition and is a sign that public higher education is increasingly unaffordable without aid.</p>\n<p>“With the way that tuition keeps increasing, it makes sense that more people are needing assistance,” Adkins said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said UC should be proud of the ranking but should not let it take away from the urgency to take on “problems that still exist.”</p>\n<p>“Between unaffordable housing, students skipping meals to save money, and the majority of students in the middle class, in particular taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, there is much work to be done,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print

The announcement to divest came after increased student pressure from a dozen schools following the May oil spill in Santa Barbara, preceded by three years of constant campaigning from Fossil Free UC.  Despite the partial victory, the University of California continues to invest in oil and gas industries involved in processes like the controversial method of hydraulic fracturing.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UCSB Organizer and global studies graduate Theo LeQuesne said Fossil Free UC is a fossil fuel divestment campaign targeting the top 200 fossil fuel industries, discerned by the amount of carbon dioxide the companies release into the atmosphere. LeQuesne said divesting from the industries forces them to take responsibility for their environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are targeting these industries is not necessarily that we think we can financially bankrupt them,” LeQuesne said. “The reason we want to do that is because they have assured themselves not to be responsible in terms of the public interest.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, fossil fuel industries lobby to block legislation targeting climate change, which motivates Fossil Free UC to continue the campaign advocating for divestment.</p>\n<p>“The fossil fuel industry has an enormous lobbying power and it’s really not okay for these people to uphold democracy and the way that politics are going at the moment,” LeQuesne said. “We will continue for divestment and we will be doing that for as long as it takes. We’re not going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said the goal of Fossil Free UCSB is to change people’s perspective on the fossil fuel industry by educating the public on the industry’s tactics and impacts in person as well as online through social media.</p>\n<p>“We do this by having conversations with people at the arbor,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a long process, it’s one person at a time. By talking to people we encourage them to come to our meetings and get involved which is really a wonderful thing to see happening on campus.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said another goal is to reinvest the UC’s capital in more sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>“Once divestment occurs you have a lot of capitol to reinvest,” LeQuesne said. “We’re not just pushing for divestment, but putting that capitol to help benefit smaller communities and to help prevent climate change. It requires a different way of thinking of divestment.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, though the oil spill in Santa Barbara last May was damaging to the environment, it also united the UCSB community to demand the UC recognize its responsibility regarding the spill.</p>\n<p>“We had about 75 students demonstrating outside of Chancellor Yang’s office against UC investments,” LeQuesne said. “The UC has investments in Exxon mobile, for example, and Exxon Mobile’s oil was running through that pipeline that burst and endangered a whole bunch of wildlife.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said Fossil Free UCSB has been campaigning for three years and are excited to have won a “partial victory” through student involvement.</p>\n<p>“The recent victory is really testament that you can as a student make a difference through campaigning and activism and that is really exciting to see,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a shame that the recent divestment didn’t result in oil and gas, it was only coal and tar sands. It’s really a matter of time, I believe. It’s not an everyday occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Isaiah Swauncy said he thinks divestment will help the shift from fossil fuels towards more sustainable alternatives.</p>\n<p>“I think fossil fuels are definitely ruining the environment,” Swauncy said. “I think it’s a great idea and stepping stone for the rest of the U.S. However, until we find another energy source that can sustain the population we can’t completely stop using fossil fuels but the UC can help with divestment.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC leader and UC Berkeley creative writing major Jake Soiffer said it is about time the UC began divesting from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>“This is a hard-fought victory for students and our allies from across California who have been demanding the UC truly live up to its big talk on climate change,” Soiffer said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

mathematician Yitang Zhang will be joining UC Santa Barbara’s mathematics faculty this fall, a development many hope will add further prestige to the university.</p>\n<p>Zhang became famous in 2013 when he submitted a proof to the Annals of Mathematics which established the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers, a feat many believed to be impossible. The New Yorker magazine published a profile on Zhang in February, and Filmmaker George Csicsery premiered a documentary on Zhang called “Counting from Infinity” in January. Zhang’s major breakthrough earned him numerous awards and honors, including the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, election to the Academia Sinica fellowship in 2014 and tenure professorship at the University of New Hampshire in 2014.<br>\nUCSB mathematics professor and number theory specialist Jeffrey Stopple said it is unusual for mathematicians to be featured in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably at this point one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Stopple said. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he hosted Zhang’s visit to UCSB during a mathematics department colloquium in May and he personally invited Zhang to join the faculty as a professor.</p>\n<p>“I was honored to be able to host his visit to our campus and to invite him to become a professor, a colleague and a friend on our campus,” Yang said in an email.<br>\nAccording to UCSB professor emeritus in mathematics Martin Scharlemann, Zhang currently stands as one of the most prestigious professors at the university.</p>\n<p>“There are various types of prestige in mathematics. One is to be known by experts in your field and another is to be known by the general public,” Scharlemann said. “At least in the second category, he’s probably the most remarkable here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>UCSB mathematics department chair and professor Darren Long said he hopes Zhang’s presence in UCSB’s math department will increase the amount of interactions between professors and expand the department’s range of research.</p>\n<p>“This is not an enormous department, so we don’t have representation in every field possible,” Long said. “He is somebody that opens up a vista in that way.”<br>\nAccording to Stopple, hiring Zhang will significantly increase the university’s prestige and will attract even more students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it raises the profile of the campus enormously,” Stopple said. “In terms of recruiting new students at UCSB, I think at all levels people will want to be here.”</p>\n<p>Long said he offered Zhang a reduced teaching load to start, but assumes Zhang will want to increase it because of his extensive teaching history at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>“It is my impression that he will want to teach undergraduates from time to time,” Long said. “I expect he will succeed.”</p>\n<p>University of Massachusetts Boston mathematics professor and former University of New Hampshire’s mathematics department chair Eric Grinberg said Zhang has always been a humble faculty member, despite his worldwide fame.</p>\n<p>“He was always very modest and unassuming and he certainly never boasted of anything,” Grinberg said. “Even though he’s become world famous, I don’t think that’s changed too much.”</p>\n<p>Grinberg said students at the University of New Hampshire found Zhang’s teaching style to be “very much accessible” and “easy to follow.”</p>\n<p>“Some people might try to impress everybody by how deep their work is and get them lost in technicalities,” Grinberg said. “Yitang Zhang doesn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said Zhang’s next goal is to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem, an important piece of a larger and more difficult problem called the Riemann Hypothesis, a 150 year-old mathematical conjecture with a one million dollar prize attached to it.</p>\n<p>“He sets his sights very high and I’m very impressed by him,” Stopple said. “Even the piece that he’s working on would make him famous all over again if he wasn’t already famous.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said it is unlikely Zhang will be able to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“In some sense, it would be like someone being struck by lightning twice,” Stopple said. “It’s ambitious to try, but he’s the guy who’s willing to try stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Yang said UCSB is an ideal place for Zhang to teach while also conducting research.</p>\n<p>“Our campus provides both the intellectual environment and spectacular beauty for him to enjoy continuing his research to solve unsolvable math problems while also teaching our students,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yitang Zhang was unavailable for comment.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

F&amp;B) recently announced several new additions to its website for the upcoming year in an attempt to help facilitate the funding process for student groups.</p>\n<p>The A.S. F&amp;B, previously known as the A.S. Finance Board, is tasked with allocating annual student fees to help fund events and services of registered student organizations. Last year, the finance board was responsible for designating the spending of the Associated Students’ $10.9 million budget, $364,812 of which went to student organizations. The committee redesigned its website and logo this summer as part of its “rebranding” efforts.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Chairman and third-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the new website will make it easier for student groups to request funding compared to the lack of “transparency” and “accessibility” in last year’s committee operations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like a lot of students didn’t really feel like we wanted to give their money back to them, which is kind of what our role is,” Constantino said. “We just want to get a new look. We want to make our brand everywhere just so that people know that this is the committee you go to to get funding and access to the fees, and part of that is redoing the website.”</p>\n<p>According to Constantino, one of the website’s new features is an online form for rollover requests and event reports, which he said could act as archives for students to use as references in future funding requests.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve just relied on asking students, ‘How much money did we give you last year?’ but that’s not really accurate and there’s really not much record keeping in those regards,” Constantino said. “Since these forms are online now, any student will be able to look up just how much money this org spent and what they spent it on online.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said confusion over policies and procedures repeatedly arose during last year’s funding processes.</p>\n<p>“When student groups were going through the funding process, a lot of the same questions kept popping up again about policies [and] procedures and what not,” Ninh said in an email. “This year, we’re aiming to solve that by providing guides and other resources that will increase clarity and give more detailed instruction so that the funding process is more efficient.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said the committee also hopes to allocate more funding to newer and smaller student groups rather than mostly funding events for larger organizations.</p>\n<p>“A large part of our funding has gone to organizations that already have a lot of funding — they can afford to fork over a few thousand dollars for their barbeque,” Constantino said. “I’d like to see more organizations, especially newer and smaller ones, being represented, to get their piece of the pie.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year computer science major Benji Lampel, who sought funding from the committee in the past for events like SB Hacks and Laughology, said the only improvement A.S. F&amp;B needs to make is increasing its financial visibility for student groups.</p>\n<p>“The only thing they could really improve on I think is making the funding easier to see when it’s distributed,” Lampel said in an email. “It was just hard to tell when the money was transferred and how much we actually got.”</p>\n<p>Ninh said A.S. F&amp;B plans to continue making events like SB Hacks possible.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students have really great ideas on how to give back to our community and enrich the student body as a whole,” Ninh said in an email. “I’m really looking forward to hearing them all, and my team and I are excited to make that happen.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 in the Thursday, Sept.

Emile Nelson and I’m the editor in chief of UCSB’s newspaper, the Daily Nexus. We have been around since 1930, and we’ve been student-run and independent ever since.</p>\n<p>In the past 85 years, we have consistently won top rankings in competitions across the state and, in both 2012 and 2013, we were nationally ranked as a top-10 college newspaper by The Princeton Review. We were the only UC newspaper to receive that honor. But weirdly enough, we don’t actually have a journalism program at UCSB — which we consider to be one of our biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Because we are not funded or sponsored by the university, we are able to give the students an organic, uncensored voice that does not have to go through any type of university editing. This means we get to do things like publish a story that leads to the resignation of a corrupt chancellor who embezzled over $170,000 (1986, Steve Elzer on ex-Chancellor Robert Huttenback), and the university cannot stop it from being published.</p>\n<p>We also get to do shit like say “shit,” because that’s how some students speak, and we have a duty to respect that creative decision. But the coolest part of being independent is that, each year, all of us get to make the Nexus exactly what we want it to be. All of us meaning the people who work here, sure, but also you, reader.</p>\n<p>We have our history, traditions and our standards, but every day we have the opportunity to make this paper exactly what we want it to be. If you want to see more coverage on this, tell me! If you want to see less talk about that, tell me! If we messed up or continue to mess up, please tell me! I am as much your employee as anyone’s, and it’s my job to make sure that the content delivered to you is as perfect as it can be.</p>\n<p>Imagine the Daily Nexus as your megaphone. If you have something to say — which I sincerely hope you all do — we’ll help you say it louder. And if you want to work with us, there’s always room. We have about 200 people working with us already, but this is a family that is always looking to grow.</p>\n<p>Come visit us under Storke Tower, check out our orientation sessions on September 28 and 29 at 6:30 p.m., enjoy a free carnival and FMLYBND concert on September 22 from 1-4 p.m. in Storke Plaza and send me an email at eic@dailynexus.com.</p>\n<p>So, whether it’s your first time on campus or your last first time on campus, welcome to paradise! I can’t wait to work with you all.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nEmile Nelson</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/","id":2695,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[2694,2693,2692],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sexual Assault Bill Allowing Punishment for Off-Campus Offenses Passes Unanimously","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HBJ.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HBJ.jpg?resize=378%2C567&ssl=1","description":"Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s Senate Bill 186 (SB 186) passed the senate floor with a unanimous 63-0 bipartisan vote on Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s Senate Bill 186 (SB 186) passed the senate floor with a unanimous 63-0 bipartisan vote on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SB 186, introduced by Jackson in February, would allow California community colleges to discipline students for off-campus sexual assault and sexual exploitation violations. The bill successfully passed through the senate and currently awaits approval by Governor Jerry Brown, who can sign it into law. University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses currently have jurisdiction to expel, suspend or enact disciplinary action on students who commit sexual assault, but not the authority to punish students for incidents that happen off campus grounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said the bill’s success was backed by the common understanding that all college students from UCs, CSUs and community colleges should be held accountable for crimes such as sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, clearly, if everyone has to meet to the same standards, there won’t be the sense that someone can get away with something that another can’t,” Jackson said. “So there’s going to be accountability, and hopefully there will be disciplinary action in both circumstances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jackson, the bill mandates punishments such as expulsion and suspension for students found guilty of sexual assault regardless of whether or not the incident happened within or outside of campus boundaries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will be monitoring this to make sure that disciplinary proceedings are effective and are pursued when there are allegations of rape and sexual assault,” Jackson said. “It is my expectation that I have discussed with the universities that they will follow this law and abide by it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) President Lori Gaskin said the unanimous passage of the bill gives the administration jurisdiction to punish crimes that happen outside of campus to ensure the safety of the student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our first priority is for student safety,” Gaskin said. “We do not tolerate violations of our college student code of conduct on any of our three campuses, and this measure would extend that authority for sexual assault and other serious student misconduct outside our campus boundaries.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaskin said she hopes the concerns of students and administration will continue to be heard regarding issues concerning safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thank Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who proposed this specific bill, and will continue to work with our local elected officials to ensure safety on all our local college campuses,” Gaskin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Gaucho Consent coordinator and alumna major Lexi Weyrick said if community colleges have procedures in place to properly adjudicate accused students, then the bill is a “no-brainer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are agreeing to a code of conduct when they attend school, just like at UCSB, and if students violate that code, it is absolutely within the school’s rights to take action as they see fit,” Weyrick said. “This bill simply gives community colleges the ability to act within those rights in regard to sexual violence, which makes sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Weyrick, the bill will ensure both UCSB and SBCC students who live in Isla Vista are on the same page regarding discipline for sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think SB 186 opens the door for greater communication between UCSB and SBCC regarding sexual violence that occurs in Isla Vista which has been very inconsistent in the past,” Weyrick said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said it is important to inform students of tolerable behavior, and SB 186 would hold students accountable for sexual assault just as they would be held accountable for academic issues such as plagiarism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of the whole issue here is empowering victims and educating students both male and female about what is acceptable and not-acceptable behavior,” Jackson said. “Colleges can expel students for things like plagiarism, so if they have the tools and procedures in place to deal with that kind of behavior, then they should certainly have the tools to discipline students for behavior as serious as rape or sexual assault.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

By November of that same year, Jammeh found his world crumbling around him.</p>\n<p>Jammeh is a third-year global studies major at UCSB who could face life imprisonment or worse for his pro-LGBTQ views if he ever returned home to the Gambia. Jammeh came to California as an international student from the Gambia on a presidential scholarship in 2011.

And, in an attempt to show solidarity with his roommate, Jammeh wrote those 14 words that may one day get him killed.</p>\n<p>Within hours after posting the message on his Facebook, Jammeh received a call from a relative in Gambia saying, “If the government sees this thing, you are dead.”</p>\n<p>“I deleted the message,” Jammeh said, “but it was too late.”</p>\n<p>The comment Jammeh wrote directly contradicts the views of his uncle, the president, and he soon found himself stripped of his scholarship, ostracized from his country and fearful for his survival.</p>\n<p>“Going back to the Gambia is like committing suicide,” Jammeh said. “There are people who might feel sorry, but not really sorry.”</p>\n<p>For months after posting this message, Jammeh was forced to sell many of his personal belongings, live in his own car, shower in the Recreation Center and hope for his next meal, all while continuing to attend UCSB and maintaining a GPA well above average.</p>\n<p>History Department Chair Sharon Farmer taught a class which Jammeh attended during this time, and said she was amazed to discover he was living in his car the entire time.</p>\n<p>“He is clearly a very sincere student, and to find out that the whole time he was in my class [he was living in his car] … He made it through two quarters and didn’t tell anybody” Farmer said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said during these months he was still expecting his government to begin providing him financial support again, but he never saw another penny.</p>\n<p>“For two months, the money was on the way … never came,” Jammeh said. “When I go to class, I couldn’t concentrate — I kept having these suicidal thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Despite his inward struggle, Farmer said Jammeh was “such a nice guy” who was “very motivated” in his studies.</p>\n<p>After coming forward with his situation, Jammeh began working with the director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), Simran Singh, to find a way to continue to attend UCSB and survive.</p>\n<p>According to Singh, Jammeh’s case has been taken very seriously by the administration and continues to be a primary concern of her office.</p>\n<p>“You do not have a student come in and make that up,” said Singh. “It’s gone up the ladder — everybody is aware of the situation.”</p>\n<p>According to David Whitman, the director of LGBT services and the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity, Jammeh’s case is a perfect example of “how alive and well homophobia is.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t out of convenience or luxury, this man is facing life in prison or worse for being supportive of the LGBTQ community,” Whitman said. “Give this student a penny, a dollar, because he is facing life in prison and he deserves it.”</p>\n<p>Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob said Jammeh’s case is “really a challenge” and that options for Jammeh are limited because of his status as an international student.</p>\n<p>“He’s been supporting people who are gay, which could be viewed as supporting criminality [in the Gambia],” Jacob said. “He would definitely be imprisoned, and I really fear for his health and well-being.”</p>\n<p>According to Singh, there have been many attempts to communicate with the Gambian government through their embassy in Washington D.C., but there has been no response from the President.</p>\n<p>“The ambassador seemed pretty much helpless unless he got help from the Gambian government,” Singh said. “The money needs to be transferred from Gambia.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the university has temporarily allowed Jammeh to continue attending classes while he struggles to come up with funding and also seek political asylum, without which he could be sent back to the Gambia.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the school said they were going to let me go to school for fall and then I have time to work and see if I could get some scholarships from somewhere, and I have also applied for asylum … So it’s 50-50,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said he looks to the UC Office of The President for its support of Jammeh and believes a community effort is absolutely necessary in supporting Jammeh.</p>\n<p>“It’s a difficult situation, but I’m hopeful that the people can come together and donate to help and that administration and UCOP can take the actions needed so that Alagie can stay,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Through the help of the OISS and other local organizations, Jammeh has secured temporary housing through the summer with local resident Mariela Marin and her family, as well as a job on campus.</p>\n<p>“I can honestly say that [Jammeh] is someone who is clearly dedicated to the journey of understanding his world and others,” said Marin. “We’re just really lucky to have him.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Jammeh’s future remains highly uncertain, as it is unclear where he will live after the summer and whether or not he will be able to continue to attend the university.</p>\n<p>Despite having deleted the original message and Facebook account, Jammeh now has a rainbow flag on his new profile picture and maintains that he is very firm in his belief that the LGBTQ community should be treated equally as human beings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64375\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1253416888\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64366\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64375\" data-attachment-id=\"64375\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/alagie-jammeh-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437994386\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64375\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"The Facebook status Jammeh posted defending homosexuality directly contradicts the views of his distant uncle, president of the Gambia.

Yang, Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker to discuss pulling Jansport products from the Bookstore. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops, Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker agreed in a meeting on Wednesday in room 5123 of Cheadle Hall to halt the Bookstore’s non-backpack apparel purchases from Jansport and discuss alternatives to Jansport backpacks in summer meetings.</p>\n<p>USAS came to the meeting demanding the Bookstore licensees be signatories to the Accord on Fire Building Safety in Bangladesh, a legally binding document that outlines factory safety standards for corporations. Because Jansport is owned by VF Corporation, whose practices in Bangladesh do not adhere to the accord, USAS demanded the Bookstore stop buying the company’s products. At the meeting, Yang also agreed to advocate for similar changes UC-wide by speaking with other chancellors.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Brandon Yadegari said he became concerned about the Bookstore licensing relationships after Rana Plaza, a factory in Bangladesh, collapsed in April of 2013, killing over 1,100 workers.</p>\n<p>“Since Rana Plaza collapsed in April of 2013, it has been pretty disturbing to us to find out about the relationships and connections between manufacturers that sell clothes to our bookstore,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yadegari said the Bookstore should not work with companies that have factories in Bangladesh such as VF, especially because collegiate apparel is a major source of its profit.</p>\n<p>“In Bangladesh, where wages are the lowest in the world and factories are the most unsafe, it seemed apparent to us as a group to work to make sure our university does not do business with companies that … are unwilling to cooperate for safer standards for those workers or who are owned by a company that participates in such supply chain management,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, while no products in the Bookstore are made in Bangladesh, profits from Jansport products go to VF, which is responsible for serious workers’ rights abuse overseas.</p>\n<p>“VF, their parent company, who owns brands like Vans, North Face and Columbia, still maintains much of their production in Bangladesh, and maintain production that is secured through relationships with local, provincial governments in Bangladesh that have consistently suppressed unionization attempts through violence, in some cases killing,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yang said he would rather work with other UC chancellors to affect system-wide change than act independently as a campus.</p>\n<p>“Many issues are joined issues. If we work together, we have better results,” Yang said. “This is not an isolated issue like an I.V. issue. This is such a good opportunity for me to bring them all on board.”</p>\n<p>Beisecker also said he advised against campus-level action to halt business with Jansport, because it may be politically unsound given other UC campuses also use the company.</p>\n<p>“For me to pull the license from Jansport and for the other campuses to keep theirs, is a real mixed message,” Beisecker said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64013\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64013\" data-attachment-id=\"64013\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/usas_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433330593\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"USAS_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64013\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Yadegari, multiple campus leadership entities unanimously voted to support a discontinuation of business with Jansport, meaning Yang should meet UCSB USAS’s demand rather than rely upon UC-wide alternatives.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming in with right now, UCSB students, UCSB Associated Students, UCSB Academic Senate, UCSB Graduate Student Association, Chancellor’s Sustainability Committee, obviously USAS, obviously the 2,000 signatures that we got, want action at UCSB,” Yadegari said. “For Chancellor Yang to see our university and our climate and then have to ask other UCs, there is a little bit of a disconnect there.”</p>\n<p>USAS member and first-year math major Kyle Butts said other university campuses have adopted the accord.</p>\n<p>“The decision is not unprecedented,” Butts said. “There are campuses like NYU, Stanford, University of Michigan. There are over 40 universities that have acquired the accord, so we are not alone.”</p>\n<p>Butts said because the UC Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees Steering Committee’s vastly supported resolution asking UC to adopt the Accord was rejected by UC President Janet Napolitano last summer in favor of allowing UC to do business with signatories of either the Accord or the much more lenient Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, USAS has little faith in the notion of UC-wide reform.</p>\n<p>“We saw UC-wide support. Every campus was in support of trying to get the Accord to be passed, and we saw the recommendation that UC as a whole should require the Accord,” Butts said. “There was so much support for that, and then it seemed like President Napolitano on her own decision ignored the recommendation and said the Alliance or the Accord.”</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, the Alliance gives corporations more flexibility in determining their own safety standards, which discouraged many student and faculty activists who had campaigned for UC adoption of the much stricter Accord.</p>\n<p>“The Office of the President handed down the decision that either the Accord or the Alliance would be required, essentially giving a lot of companies an easier way out of holding themselves accountable and responsible for the conditions that they perpetuate in Bangladesh,” Yadegari said. “I think that was really demoralizing for a lot of us.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said, given the shortfall of Napolitano’s decision, campus USASs need to take initiative.</p>\n<p>“At this point, with UC-wide activism being forced into retreat after the president’s decision, USAS at UCSB has come back and said ‘our chancellor will listen to us, we want to work with him, we want to work with our administration,’” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Dana Patterson said through campus-level adoption of the Accord, UCSB can lead the way for UC-wide change.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has been on this and them being able to extend that to the other UCs, and that’s just our strategy as of right now,” Patterson said. “We’re the most active USAS campus, so we’re very much leading the way … We’re the strongest organization of the UCs working on this. We’re the most proactive group.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, UCSB’s independent adoption of the Accord could be the most effective step toward UC adoption.</p>\n<p>“By UCSB leading the way and forcing strictly the accord … we could rejuvenate a lot of the activity campaigns toward the Accord,” Butts said. “If UCSB makes the first stride to require the Bangladesh Accord, that gives the committee more power for producing another resolution for Janet Napolitano.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said Yang needed to represent the student body by supporting the Bookstore’s adoption of the Accord rather than consider UC politics.</p>\n<p>“We can make our own decisions. Every relevant governing body on campus has told you want they want you to do” Yadegari said. “We understand it’s hard for you to put your neck out on the line, but when every student is telling you to, you should.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Beisecker, Fisher and Yang agreed the Bookstore should initiate adoption of the Accord by stopping orders from Jansport for non-backpack apparel, but Fisher said backpack orders would have to continue until USAS presented a comparable alternative.</p>\n<p>“We’re not driving the market, the market drives us,” Fisher said. “We have to find a product line that will replace the one we already have.”</p>\n<p>Yang said while he will support a UCSB initiative, he still plans to talk to other chancellors to implement similar change on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I am willing to talk to them, I will be strategically talking to them,” Yang said. “You have more work to do to go to the other students and say ‘we met with our chancellor, have you met with yours?’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64091\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64091\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/","id":2739,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2738,2737,2736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New A.S.

Sworn in May 27 to fill vacancies left by three senators who stepped down shortly after the spring elections, on-campus senator and first-year undeclared major Elizabeth Brock and on-campus senator and first-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez were selected by a special committee after an interview process to replace Brendan Korbas and David Xie. Off-campus senator and second-year political science major Kelly Pearman replaced Jake Johnson after having been his runner-up in the spring 2015 elections.</p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR </b><b>ELIZABETH BROCK</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b>: Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I love being involved and am extremely passionate about impacting lives; I felt this position could give me a better chance in reaching as many students as possible across our campus and that my plans to impact our shared community could be put in motion more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Have you been involved with A.S. before?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I have not, so this is very exciting for me!</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: This past year, I’ve been the president of the amazing Santa Cruz Residence Hall … Being president automatically placed me in the Residence Halls Association … where I also discovered my passion for student affairs. I’m also a newer part of the National Residence Hall Honorary, or NRHH, and it’s been great getting to know that new family as well.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you hope to accomplish this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I hope to eventually separate Counseling and Psychological Services [C.A.P.S.] from Career Services, as they’re both currently housed in the same building … It’s absurd that certain counselors at C.A.P.S. have offices the size of closets … I believe the C.A.P.S. building should also be painted and possibly renovated. Hopefully, there can be a collaboration with our university’s art department to create some beautiful murals over that Pepto-Bismol pink. That space is supposed to be a welcoming invitation for students seeking help, and walking up to that building illustrates the exact opposite. We should feel motivated and inspired when entering the C.A.P.S. environment, and brightening its atmosphere would truly help.</p>\n<p>Another project I’d like to take on is placing mental health kits in every room of every residence hall before move-in day Fall Quarter. I feel this will show incoming as well as returning students how valuable and vital our mental well-being is. By placing these kits in the rooms first thing, we’ll be able to create a healthier, more active and more knowledgeable mental health environment where students will hopefully begin to value their internal well-being much more seriously.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why do you think you will be a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I am straightforward when addressing situations, and I’m not afraid to communicate when hard conversations are needed … My compassion for others and my overall love for our university drives my passion to be in this position and will allow me to work devotedly and wholeheartedly towards every goal that’s in front of me. I maintain a very open mind, and I love to hear about ways to improve what’s already set in motion. I believe in listening to other perspectives before solidifying any decision … I am qualified with leading a council and being an active and leading member in multiple organizations through high school to now. I enjoy working in a team and deeply value collaboration and coexisting efforts to get things done, which I believe will help me connect with departments across campus to complete my mental health projects.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want to change about A.S.?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>:  A.S. should not be about who’s in which party, who has the greatest ego or who’s enemies and friends with who. There should not be that internal drama because it infects the organization and results negatively in helping our community and constituents. We should all be working together towards the same goal of bettering our campus to brighten student lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>OFF-CAMPUS SENATOR KELLY PEARMAN</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why did you run to be an off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I chose to run to be a senator because I really wanted the opportunity to improve the campus and community for students and Isla Vista residents. I really have the passion to be a voice for students and I am so excited to be one of their representatives. I can’t wait to create change.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What experience do you have being involved in the UCSB community?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been involved in A.S. for the past two years. As a first-year, I was a fellow in the Internal Vice President’s Office. During my second year at UCSB, I was the senate coordinator in the Internal Vice President’s Office and I was also the recruitment and outreach coordinator for Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>I am a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was also involved with RHA during my first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What projects do you want to complete as a senator this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: My first project goal is to create a more interactive training for sexual assault intervention and prevention. I want to work with Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council to implement this. Also, I want to collaborate with my fellow senators Austin Hechler and Mika Kawakami on this project, who also have knowledge about Greek life.</p>\n<p>Another project I want to work on is developing a long-term parking plan in Isla Vista … It is creating safety problems and causing I.V. residents to receive citations. I want to work with the EVPLA Office and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on this project along with holding forums for students to voice their opinion on how they want parking to change in the future. Having a lot of student input is really important.</p>\n<p>My third project goal is to create vending machines in Isla Vista with school and study supplies in them so students can access these resources at any time of the day. A few previous senators have worked on this project, and I want to continue it and implement it.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge during your time as off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I expect that it will be challenging to work with 24 other very passionate people, and I know some meetings will be difficult when our opinions clash.</p>\n<p>People will disagree, but I plan to put myself in other people’s shoes to understand where they are coming from. I think it’s really important to try to understand why people believe the things they do and that will really help me in deciding about legislation and working with people throughout the year.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want incoming senators to do differently than their predecessors?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I think that the Senate should really take the time and effort during the first few weeks of the term to really get to know the Legal Code, the financial policies and the structure of the association itself. When Senators are more knowledgeable about the association and its governing documents, etcetera, they will be able to navigate it a lot better when writing legislation and when they are initiating projects.</p>\n<p>Senators should definitely take extra steps to work with Senators that they normally hadn’t already worked with. It makes Senate a closer group of people with better camaraderie and working rapport.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What will make you a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been very involved in A.S. for the last two years, and this gives me the experience and knowledge about what students want, and how we as student leaders can give that to them. Being the senate coordinator for a year gave me the knowledge of what it means and what it takes to be a great senator. I also have worked with past senators on projects and legislation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR MERCEDES RODRIGUEZ</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: </b><b>Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez:</em> At first, I didn’t know much about it, so my RA kind of encouraged me because I’m in Hall Council currently and he thought it would be a good fit for me, and he also explained to me how we can help advocate for students and get their voices heard, and that’s what I really want to focus on, being a political science major actually wanting to go into activism.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>I actually wasn’t involved in A.S., I was just involved in Hall Council. I was a multicultural awareness chair, so I pick up on all of the isms, and that made me a lot more aware … I think knowing a lot more of those ideas is going to help me just kind of implement the things that I actually want to see being done … I think racism is going to be a huge one.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What are your goals for the coming year?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Definitely just trying to push for diversity, I think that’s going to be my focal point for this year. Not necessarily to offset the demographics, but kind of teach people that our demographics are not as correct as some people might think they are, and that the underrepresented do have a voice and they’re actually very vital to our school. So I’m going to be focusing definitely on the minorities and just having their voices heard and all their work being recognized.</p>\n<p>Living on the multicultural floor this year, I know I definitely want to bring it back because I know it is going to change into a first-generation floor. But I want to bring back the multicultural floor definitely because I feel like it had a huge impact on my overall experience of being a first-year … For now, that’s the only concrete idea I have, because I just currently was aware that I got into office.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge as a senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Being biracial, first of all, because I am Caucasian and I am Hispanic so it’s kind of hard to be myself in both positions, because I do look more Hispanic, I get mistaken for being full Hispanic … I’m going to try to understand both sides of the spectrum, but it’s just going to be really hard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/","id":2738,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2737,2736,2735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Administrators, Students Discuss Sexual Assault Case Procedures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chancellor-Yang-Forum-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chancellor-Yang-Forum-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You” campaign leaders and survivors of sexual assault Alejandra Melgoza, Melissa Vasquez and Lexi Weyrick organized an open forum with Chancellor Henry T.

Yang and other university administrators Friday morning in the UCen’s State Street room to discuss UCSB’s handling of sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>At the forum, students worked with administrators to clarify the 13 demands Melgoza, Vasquez and Weyrick made at the May 13 sit-in in Yang’s office. Attendees had the opportunity to ask questions of the campaign leaders and participating administrators regarding current sexual assault policies and the 13 demands.</p>\n<p>UCSB Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment and Title IX Compliance Director Ricardo Alcaino said the office cannot hire staff based on race or gender, but hopes to create a more diverse staff to fulfill the 11th demand.</p>\n<p>“We cannot select individuals due to their race or gender, we can’t do that, but we definitely can cast very broad nets and make sure our pools are very diverse so naturally, obviously, we will be more likely get a diverse candidate,” Alcaino said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said the fifth demand calls for the creation of an Associated Students Survivor Fund to cover medical, travel, housing and other expenses for survivors of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“We are making sure that those funds are available to students and that students know these funds are available to them, because, often times, survivors have expenses, particularly for housing,” Melgoza said. “They want to move out of their living space, especially if it is out in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Weyrick, the A.S. Survivor Fund would come from donations and would not increase student fees.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t coming from student fees, this doesn’t raise tuition or anything like that,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Weyrick said availability of an A.S. Survivor Fund would not lead to false accusations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I really do not think there would be any kind of people that would want to first go through this and abuse these funds,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said Yang supports further examination of the second demand, which would increase the minimum suspension from one quarter to four quarters for students found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The university still has to look into the legalities of that, and that is actually higher up, that is not something we can just do as a campus, so the Chancellor has given his support for a recommendation to pass that on,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said the third demand states the university must remove sexual assault perpetrators from university housing, employment or organizations.</p>\n<p>“Often times, immediate removal from housing doesn’t happen,” Melgoza said. “It is very interesting how students are removed from housing for playing loud music … but when it is about interpersonal violence it is not often talked about.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso said UCPD Chief Dustin Olson wants his staff to reflect the student body and supports the sixth demand, which aims to increase the number of women serving in local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Chief Olson is really big on having a diverse department that represents all of campus,” Arviso said. “We are really excited about that and most of those female officers and certainly a handful of male officers have expressed an interest in working with these types of crimes.”</p>\n<p>Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) Assistant Dean of Student Life Suzanne Perkin said she needs further information regarding the eighth demand, calling for a method for students to evaluate and share their experiences with OJA.</p>\n<p>“We need something formal,” Perkin said. “Like here is an email that I got that was insensitive or here is an interaction that I had on this date that didn’t sit well with me or something like that. Something very concrete instead of just ‘it was mishandled.’”</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, students who have bad experiences with OJA should be able to give a detailed report.</p>\n<p>“That is going to take time and trust for students,” Weyrick said, “It is not a grievance thing. It is a legitimate concern with how their case was handled, with who they were working with, so there would of course be solid like some sort of information something to relay, it would be specifics.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-63977\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Megan Mineiro/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Members of various environmental organizations, including Fossil Free UCSB, gathered outside Cheadle Hall Thursday afternoon to protest for the UC Board of Regents to divest from the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>Protesters marched from Cheadle Hall through the Arbor to the patio behind the MultiCultural Center (MCC) carrying a plastic model of a pipeline and chanting, “We are unstoppable. Another world is possible.” The protest continued with presentations from event organizers demanding the UC divest from companies involved in oil spills and invest in students, followed by public comment from faculty, alumni and students on their frustration over the May 19 Refugio oil spill of over 100,000 gallons and the environmental damage caused by the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>Member of the California Students Sustainability Coalition and the Students Against Fracking campaign and UCSB alumnus Arlo Bender-Simon said he is frustrated the money he paid to the UC during his four years at UCSB is invested in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“The money that I have put into the UC system over the last four years is being invested into fossil fuel companies that continue to profit off of disastrous spills,” Bender-Simon said. “We really need to let our regents, our campus administration know it’s not ok for them to keep investing.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign Director for California Students Sustainability Coalition and UCSB alumna Emily Williams said the Refugio oil spill is not an isolated incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s a symptom; it’s just one piece of a much larger pattern that we see with the fossil-fuel-powered economy,” Williams said. “The root cause is this industry and, as it turns out, our university invests a lot of money in ExxonMobil, whose oil is being carried in Peabody [Energy] coal and a lot of these huge culprits. So we’re demanding that the university stop investing in these fuels and start investing in students, and start investing in our futures.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Academic Senate voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment in 2013 and Fossil Free UCSB is now working to gain Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s support of the movement, according to Williams.</p>\n<p>“On campus, we are really focusing on getting Chancellor Yang to come out and support his students and faculty, because all these different bodies have already come out in support of it,” Williams said. “We know we have the finances behind us, we know we have the morals behind us, let’s go back into negotiations and get this thing to happen.”</p>\n<p>Students Against Fracking Chair, Fossil Free UC and Environmental Affairs Board member and fourth-year global studies major Kiyomi De Zoysa said she views the recent spill as an opportunity for the community to change its opinion about investing in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“Especially at the UC, we’re complacent; we’re supporting Exxon, and Exxon’s product is what directly spilled into our environment,” De Zoysa said. “So we are directly invested in Exxon’s work. So, by that, we need to not be involved in it and make a political statement, social statement. It’s a moral imperative as the world’s greatest public institution.”</p>\n<p>Bender-Simon said Students Against Fracking aims to use the oil spill to mobilize students to participate in the movement to divest.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out how we can really educate people about what fracking is, what steam injection is, what acidizing is, why we really don’t need to be doing all these newer, dirtier, more energy-intensive extraction techniques and why we need to move towards renewable energy,” Bender-Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams said she believes discussions on whether the Paddle Out on Wednesday as part of the May 23 memorial events series should have been canceled because of the recent spill signify the importance of divesting from the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“The Paddle Out that was earlier [last] week, I think the fact that that beautiful ceremony was threatened by this oil spill also made people really realize, when we’re trying to come together as a community, there is this industry that’s blocking our way,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>De Zoysa said she was pleased with the turnout at the protest and hopes to see students continue to get involved in the campaign to divest.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how many people came out. Not just students, but a lot of influential activists on campus: John Foran and others,” De Zoysa said. “I was really happy and inspired to see people come up and speak their hearts and share information and how we can all get involved. I feel this momentum is building.”</p>\n<p>De Zoysa said she has seen an increase in the amount of student participation in environmental organizations on campus since the Refugio oil spill.</p>\n<p>“This event would not have had such a turnout if it weren’t for the oil spill,” De Zoisa said. “This is a great opportunity to reel as many people in as possible because they understand … animals are dying and washing up on shore and it’s really sad and it’s our fault. So we have a responsibility to make it right.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Pierce Abrahamson said he believes UCSB cannot claim to be one of the country’s top environmentally conscious universities when they are part of a system investing in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“We as a school can say, ‘Oh, we’re environmental, we’re the greenest campus in the United States,’ but it doesn’t really mean much if we keep supporting the industry that is undermining the whole entire environmental movement to begin with,” Abrahamson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said any student who values the beach and ocean should think about participating with one of the many environmental groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a campaign for financial experts. This isn’t a campaign for crazy radicals. This is a campaign for anyone who wants to have a livable future,” Williams said. “This is for anyone who thinks our beaches and oceans shouldn’t be filled with oil. So people should get involved … you don’t have to be an ‘activist’ to do it. This is not radical. This is very much something that is affecting us, and we need to make a change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

id=\"caption-attachment-63892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ability to hold a memorial in this way for those lost last May is unique and deeply personal to the UCSB and Isla Vista community. Last year’s Paddle Out was hugely successful in helping many to find solace on the water and to recognize the hope and strength that comes from community. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hundreds of UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents attended the second annual I.V. Memorial Paddle Out Wednesday evening at the beach north of Campus Point to commemorate the lives of the six students lost in the tragedy of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>UCSB Surf Team hosted the event with help from lifeguards and safety personnel who led attendees with boards and floatation devices into high tide. Onlookers who did not enter the water watched from the beach and surrounding cliffs as participants in the ocean formed a circle to symbolize solidarity, similar to the one formed a year ago.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the Paddle Out represents healing and is the “perfect ending” to the series of memorial events paying homage to the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“In my humble opinion, doing it in the ocean is, in itself, a healing and a cleansing act,” Jones said. “I think many community members that participated this evening intrinsically recognized the event.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy major and UCSB Surf Team member Alex Banks said the event was unique way to pay condolences to the students lost last year due to I.V.’s close proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“We have this beautiful ocean, and paddling out and surfing is a great way to pay respect to people that have passed away, regardless of the circumstances,” Banks said. “The fact that we have this resource is cool, and I think it’s a very inviting and serene atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Anne Trinh said she was not present during the events of May 23 last year, but still felt the Paddle Out strengthened the sense of community.</p>\n<p>“Being able to come out makes everyone feel like they are part of the community,” Trinh said. “So taking part in remembering those we lost, and recognizing what happened really allows us to come together, no matter how long you’ve been here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the Paddle Out took on a “jubilant” atmosphere when people on the shore cheered for a couple’s pitbull wearing a life jacket struggling to stay on the surfboard while the couple tried to Paddle Out.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63894\" data-attachment-id=\"63894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/paddle-out-2015_by-lorenzo-basilio-web-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432751953\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Paddle Out/Sunset 2015\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63894\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was after everyone had started paddling out and they were trying to catch up,” Jones said. “But the waves started to kick up and they just couldn’t get the dog out there on the board. A wave would come over and knock him off the board and people would be like, ‘Oh no, oh no,’ and it was that kind of fun community vibe.”</p>\n<p>According to Banks, the presence of lifeguards, water patrol and emergency responders contributed to the sense of community for those participating in the event, because it showed solidarity between the county and local residents.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we got all these different agencies like the fire department and police to come out and watch over this event just promotes what we’re trying to do here even more,” Banks said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and Humans of UCSB Photographer Alex Nguyen said the event felt more optimistic and celebratory compared to last year’s Paddle Out, which focused on the community’s strength dealing with tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Last year’s Paddle Out was a reflection of what it means to be a Gaucho in the wake of a tragedy,” Nguyen said. “This year’s is more of a celebration of knowing what it means to be a Gaucho and the strength this community has gained over the last year.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the Paddle Out is symbolic of UCSB’s dedication to serving the environment and overcoming difficulties in light of the recent oil spill near Refugio.</p>\n<p>“There was discussion about whether or not it would affect the Paddle Out, which was planned months ago,” Jones said. “I think there’s also a consciousness about our environment, about the beauty of environment, about protecting our environment that is symbolized in the Paddle Out itself.”</p>\n<p>A version of this

will come together on Friday to discuss demands made by students during the May 13 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You” campaign led by survivors of sexual assault Alejandra Melgoza, Lexi Weyrick and Melissa Vasquez will host an open forum discussion between students and university administrators on Friday in the State Street room of the University Center at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez led a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office on May 13 to demand specific policies to improve the university’s handling of sexual assault cases. One of the stipulations made in the discussion that concluded the sit-in was an agreement to hold a public forum which Yang would attend. Interim Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and additional administrators, including members of the Office of Judicial Affairs, have also committed to participate in the forum.</p>\n<p>The forum will include clarification of the demands and further discussion of plans to meet the students’ requests. On the event Facebook page, organizers cautioned those who plan to attend that administrators are mandatory reporters, meaning students should not share details of their experiences of sexual violence or sexual assault if they do not wish to “inadvertently begin an investigation.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Lexi Weyrick said the forum will provide students an opportunity to voice their concerns to administrators on issues related to sexual violence and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good setup for students to be able to air their grievances, for administration to see that this isn’t just about the three of us, to make sure that people are aware of the implications of sexual assault and sexual violence on the campus as a whole,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said the event aims to provide students the opportunity to present their concerns on sexual violence and sexual assault to Yang in person.</p>\n<p>“It is an open forum for students to voice their concerns to Chancellor Yang and also to voice their concerns about our demands and help brainstorm ideas on how to further improve them or actually get them to happen,” Melgoza said. “It is just really a meeting for students to come talk to the Chancellor about their concerns — since it is pretty hard to get a meeting with him, we figured this would be a good way to have students talk to him face to face.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said while Yang is often limited in the amount of time he can speak with students in person about their concerns, other members-of the administration frequently work one-on-one with students.</p>\n<p>“The Chancellor has a pretty full calendar, and so it is challenging sometimes for students,” Fleming said. “Certainly, a lot of us at Students Affairs spend a lot of time working with students directly.”</p>\n<p>Fleming also said administrators have discussed plans to increase the amount of communication between students and administrators with It’s Not On Us, It’s On You leaders.</p>\n<p>“What we probably need is some more regular opportunities to hear from students,” Fleming said. “We’ve talked about establishing more of a permanent group that students can be part of that would meet just on a regular basis, maybe quarterly, with those of us that work in these areas to share.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Catt Phan said she spent six hours at the sit-in and plans to attend the forum because she believes it is “crucial” for students to hold the university accountable for the ways they have handled sexual assault in past years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like admin and judicial affairs care more about our student fees instead of our sanity and bodies,” Phan said in an email. “It’s up to us to have productive dialogue because if change doesn’t happen now, it’s not going to happen later.”</p>\n<p>Phan said she believes sexual violence may be the biggest issue on campus and in Isla Vista and the university needs to better educate students on the importance of consent.</p>\n<p>“With the reputation of a ‘party school,’ there is a higher risk of sexual assault and unfortunately not enough people are educated about the sexual violence issues,” Phan said in an email. “We need to educate people and de-stigmatize sexual assault … the idea of consent needs to be further emphasized and survivors need to feel safe enough to come forth with their stories.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs office fellow and first year psychology major Alissa Gomez said she hopes to see a large number of students at the event because she believes sexual violence and sexual assault are issues affecting students both on campus and on a national level.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people will feel free to voice their opinions as needed and that they’ll get to say what they feel is needed to their administrators,” Gomez said. “We have the ability as college students to make this change not only on our campus, but on campuses across the nation.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said while she is uncertain how many students will turn out to participate in the discussion, the campaign as a whole has received positive feedback.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a lot of interest. I feel like there will be a good amount of people, even if it’s just even to like critique our demands I feel like there will be turnout,” Weyrick said. “Also, to address Chancellor Yang, having that opportunity, I think, will get turnout.”</p>\n<p>Last Thursday, Melgoza, Vasquez and Weyrick planned to speak in public forum at the UC Board of Regents meeting to present their demands to UC President Janet Napolitano and Governor Jerry Brown, but were unable to attend due to flight cancelations and delays, according to Weyrick.</p>\n<p>“We got to the airport in plenty of time to catch our flight, but it was overbooked and so they wouldn’t let us on the plane even though we had reserved seats,” Weyrick said. “So that started just a snowball effect — we couldn’t get on the standby for the second, our third flight got cancelled, the fourth flight was delayed an hour.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said although she, Melgoza and Vasquez were unable to attend the meeting, they still plan to make their demands known at a system-wide level.</p>\n<p>“We were unable to attend the Regents meeting, but we do still have a meeting with [UC Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance and Audit Officer] Sheryl Vacca in the works, so we’re still meeting with her, regardless,” Weyrick said. “We have a guarantee of a meeting, we are just scheduling it now. It will definitely be in the next couple of weeks.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 28, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/","id":2735,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2734,2733,2732],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":63,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
