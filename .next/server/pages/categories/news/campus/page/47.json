Originally a brainchild of UCSB Hacking Team, Shellphish was founded by UCSB professor Giovanni Vigna and is one of the oldest continually active CTF teams in existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been super into computers and started programming them around the age of 12 just making games and stuff,” Andrew Dutcher said of his start in hacking. Andrew Dutcher and his friends attended a hacking competition at Carnegie Mellon University during their junior year of high school, and he said, “we ended up winning, somehow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan Shoshitaishvili, a senior member of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shellphish and a computer science graduate student, had similar beginnings in hacking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been working with computers since I was eight, but got pulled into actual hacking in high school by hacking around with my friends,” he said. “I went to the DEFCON computer security conference held in Las Vegas every summer and was completely hooked after that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CTF, students perform numerous challenges to test their cyber security skills. Easier challenges can take as little as 10 minutes, while more difficult tasks can take up to 18 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CTF events occur all over the world every weekend, but Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) is the largest student-run cyber security event in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAW features six competitions, keynote presentations, workshops and an industry fair. Students range across all different ages and experience levels from high school students to doctoral candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seemingly daunting task of 48 hours of competition to solve intense cyber security challenges, the common sentiment among both organizers and participants of CSAW is that it’s a fun event for people interested in cyber security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“CTF is really just a puzzle game for security professionals to practice their skills in a controlled and fun environment,” Andrew Dutcher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To expand the reach of the competition to gain worldwide impact, CSAW this year partnered with NYU Abu Dhabi and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasir Memon, professor of computer science and engineering at NYU, founded the competition 13 years ago when cyber security was still a burgeoning field of work. He said that, today, young minds are needed to address the vulnerabilities in rapidly expanding technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think security is an interesting discipline, because it’s more than just technology,” Memon said. “It’s a psychological problem, a business problem, a policy problem, a legal problem. We need to have the right minds in the discipline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, there have been over one million cybersecurity job openings just this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expansion of these skills may be key to finding work in the increasingly competitive job market, for the members of Shellphish, it’s just a fun way to hang out with friends while learning about hacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Thompson, third-year computer science major at NYU with a specialty in cyber security, is the lead organizer for the Capture The Flag event. He said it is “extremely important” for people to know that cyber security programs such as CSAW are making an effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Going through this competition is the equivalent to earning a degree in computer security; having the CSAW name behind a person gives them a lot of validity,” Thompson said. “We’re trying to get companies to realize the talent that’s available while also giving people something to challenge themselves and have fun with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 15 teams which have outlasted preliminary competitions will advance to finals in New York from Nov. 10-12. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about Shellphish’s shot at winning CTF finals, Andrew Dutcher said they were “almost zero” due to the graduation of much of the original team. He said, however, that “regardless of if we win or not, the next step is to keep improving … There’s always room to grow and get better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memon, too, is remaining optimistic about UCSB’s chances. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think [UCSB] will do well,” he said. “You have a good team; you’ll place high.”</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: Shellphish placed in the top ten of United States teams, but did not receive first place. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/","id":2457,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2456,2455,2454],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arbor’s Tarot Card Reader Buckingham Reads Fortunes, Gives Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=586%2C374&ssl=1","description":"Near the corner of the Arbor’s bustling walkway, a small camp-like setup can be seen next to Larry Calvaletto’s “Got Questions?” booth.

Advertised with a piece of cardboard inked with the words “Tarot Reading,” the curious setup is gathered around a man in dark clothing reading a student’s fortune.</p>\n<p>Dan Buckingham, a 26-year-old Tarot card reader from Michigan, has settled down on campus after three years of travelling. He has been visiting the Arbor Monday through Fridays the past five weeks.</p>\n<p>According to Buckingham, his primary goal is not to make money; he charges no “fixed rate” and asks only for donations if students are willing. Rather, he said he does Tarot reading to offer guidance to lost students.</p>\n<p>“I do it to help people; to give guidance and counsel to those who are just sort of wanting some clarity or wanting advice from somebody,” he said. “And past that, it’s a way to bring up certain topics or uncomfortable discussions that are otherwise inaccessible other than through a medium like Tarot or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham has been doing Tarot readings for almost a year-and-a-half, receiving generally positive feedback from his clients.</p>\n<p>“Before the reading, they’re normally curious,” Buckingham said. “The majority of them have never done this before, so they generally go to it with some expectation but don’t really know what’s going to happen. Afterwards, they’re generally pleased, surprised at the accuracy and overall happy with the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The basic idea behind a Tarot reading is simple — the querent (the one receiving the fortune) picks an instructed amount of cards from a shuffled 78-card deck. The reader then lays out the chosen cards in a spread — that is a shape or pattern — that consists of different meanings depending on where the card is placed.</p>\n<p>The Tarot reader (Buckingham, in this case) then interprets how the meaning of the card corresponds to the position it is in, and he gives a description or advice to the client what the spread seems to be saying about their current life situation.</p>\n<p>Although Buckingham’s primary goal is to help those who are lost, there are some people he does not read for.</p>\n<p>“I almost never read for people who are intoxicated,” Buckingham said. “Also, if I have a suspicion that somebody won’t be appreciative or won’t take it seriously, then I will immediately turn them away because I don’t want to waste my energy and time to help somebody who is not going to use it.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest concern involves contemporary society, and the direction it is headed if it doesn’t change.</p>\n<p>“I sort of see that the way humans conduct themselves — with themselves as well as the rest of the world — is in a manner that is unsustainable and cannot be maintained for any much longer. And so this includes a whole host of systems we have in place and the ways we do business,” Buckingham said. “If this is not somehow overturned or stopped or changed, then very serious irreversible repercussions will result, and so that’s of concern to me.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham specifically chose to do his readings on a university campus because students are “kind of figuring out who they are,” during a very important “transformation” in their lives.</p>\n<p>“So I really feel like the world is in a position where that age group and that kind of potential is really necessary to address, and they really are the ticket to the solution.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest advice to UCSB students is to not worry too much, including about knowledge, material wealth, a degree or a job.</p>\n<p>“I think in one way everyone is already enlightened, or is in complete connection with everything and that there is no religion or doctrine or thing that one needs to pursue or experience to get that,” he said. “In the end, I just want to empower them; urge them to think about things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/arbors-tarot-card-reader-buckingham-reads-fortunes-gives-advice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/arbors-tarot-card-reader-buckingham-reads-fortunes-gives-advice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/arbors-tarot-card-reader-buckingham-reads-fortunes-gives-advice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/arbors-tarot-card-reader-buckingham-reads-fortunes-gives-advice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/arbors-tarot-card-reader-buckingham-reads-fortunes-gives-advice/","id":2456,"author":{"id":107,"name":"Shelley Kim"},"related":[2455,2454,2453],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"U-Mail Phishing Scams Resurface","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students have reported another round of phishing emails circulating through UCSB’s U-Mail system attempting to gather student info.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Just after the system-wide start of National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), UC Santa Barbara students received an email notification Oct. 6 about an increase in email phishing on University accounts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73125\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73125\" data-attachment-id=\"73125\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/umail-phishing/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=3075%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3075,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Umail Phishing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C578&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-73125\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Umail-Phishing-by-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x666.jpg?resize=888%2C578\" alt=\"Chief Information Security Officer Sam Horowitz advises students to look out for suspicious emails being received by their U-Mail accounts, especially those that look like they come from other UCSB accounts.

He says that students are more likely to trust emails from these “legitimate” accounts. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The email, sent by Sam Horowitz, the chief information security officer at UCSB, gave tips for keeping student information secure, such as how to spot phishing attempts, suspicious URLs and Trojan horse attachments.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said this latest phishing campaign was made possible by “a few relatively narrow campaigns targeted at staff” in the summer. The attack originated when a compromised U-Mail account sought to collect additional usernames and passwords in the last week of September.</p>\n<p>According to Horowitz, users are more likely to trust the compromised account when it is a real UCSB email account. The result is “a continuous loop:” one account gets phished and that account is used to phish others.</p>\n<p>As a result, it becomes difficult to track or prevent phishing attacks when they are actually sourced from legitimate accounts.</p>\n<p>At that point, students would have to call or visit the Collaborate Student Support Center to have a necessary password reset on their account. According to Horowitz, there’s no way to tell how many people responded to the attacks, but he can confirm that it was “more than a rare occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the message came too late for Ashley de Leon, a first-year film and media studies major, whose account was locked when it became a victim to phishing.</p>\n<p>De Leon explains that she received a high number of illicit emails informing her that her inbox was too full and that she needed to sign in to upgrade her storage. At first, she responded by clearing out her inbox, but after repeated pestering, she finally submitted her information.</p>\n<p>“I first noticed something was wrong when the window disappeared after I put in my information,” she said. “Then things started getting really wrong about a day later when I was receiving emails from Microsoft saying that my emails weren’t sending. I hadn’t sent any emails, and it was like 50 of these coming in.”</p>\n<p>The U-Mail system was blocking a large number of the outgoing emails that the phishers were using her account to send, but it’s still unknown how many were actually successfully sent.</p>\n<p>“First I changed my password … and it worked, but then the next day I got entirely locked out of the whole system,” de Leon said.</p>\n<p>After receiving help from the I.T. department, de Leon was finally able to recover her account, and it is no longer being used for phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>NCSAM “emphasizes proper cyber security practices through webinars, posters, YouTube videos, social media outreach and on-campus presentations,” Matt Hall, the chief information officer at UCSB, said. Fittingly, the first two weeks of NCSAM focus directly on topics of phishing — email and otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em>

students expressed themselves in spoken word on Monday at the annual “Coming Out Monologues,” sharing their experiences aloud to usher in National Coming Out Day on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>For approximately eight years, the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) has organized the event as a safe space for students.</p>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center Theater was a full house Monday, with people struggling to find a place to sit, or even stand, so that they could find a view of the stage.</p>\n<p>Manny Jimenez, the show’s coordinator, began the night by introducing the event format. The first hour was allotted for scheduled performers, and the second hour opened up the stage for all interested performers.</p>\n<p>The poets were from diverse backgrounds, and each one talked about different topics while on stage. Jimenez was the first to take the stage. He started off his performance by placing a rug on the floor alongside some candles, creating an altar. He performed a skit with spoken word integrated to it, prompting resounding applause from the audience.</p>\n<p>The rest of the performers introduced themselves by first name only, focusing attention on their poems. Ariel and Emma sat on stage and told their stories, and Andrew used the time on stage to speak about his mental health.</p>\n<p>Ezra told a story about being partially closeted, admitting that he was out to his friends and people at school but not to his family. He noted that many people speak about the benefits of coming out, but also offered advice for those who fear the process.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to be closeted; coming out is your choice,” Ezra said.</p>\n<p>In Yessica Ramirez’ performance, she talked about her struggles with coming out in addition to being a Mexican immigrant.</p>\n<p>The final planned performance was from Kyle. Kyle took the time to first tell the audience how he had moved away from his parents and was homeless for most of high school. He also recited a poem called, “A Love That’s Not a Choice,” which prompted rounds of loud applause from audience members.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73060\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-11/students-spin-poetry-at-annual-coming-out-monologues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73060\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-11/students-spin-poetry-at-annual-coming-out-monologues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-11/students-spin-poetry-at-annual-coming-out-monologues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-11/students-spin-poetry-at-annual-coming-out-monologues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-11/students-spin-poetry-at-annual-coming-out-monologues/","id":2454,"author":{"id":108,"name":"Yazmin Garcia"},"related":[2453,2452,2451],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Grant To Lay Framework for Digital Database","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=960%2C641&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB library has received a $100,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences to create a framework that supports extensive digital library collections.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72906\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72906\" data-attachment-id=\"72906\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/new-grant-to-lay-framework-for-digital-database/library-by-eric-swenson/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=960%2C641&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,641\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-by-eric-swenson\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72906\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"The grant — which totals $100,000 — aims to begin initial proceedings for creating a framework that can support vast digital library collections.

The team began to form in November 2015, after which it took almost a year to secure the grant. Because it was his first time applying for such a grant, he said the success of the application was due to the expertise and specialization of the team, many of whom spent years researching before coming together to work on the proposal.</p>\n<p>Padilla estimates that the majority of the money will be used to support the participation of visiting researchers, bringing together a group of experts both nationally and internationally.</p>\n<p>He believes that it is crucial to have a “diverse representation of voices,” since the project is interdisciplinary.</p>\n<p>The money will be allocated toward travel and lodging costs, as well as other expenses necessary to facilitate the meetings.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) awards the National Leadership Grants to support projects that benefit libraries through advances in research and new tools, models and services.</p>\n<p>A press release from IMLS states that out of the 85 preliminary applications that were received, 19 full proposals were invited for further review and only 15 libraries were given grants. IMLS Director Dr. Kathryn K. Matthew said that the “recipients represent the best of the best,” and all the recipients went through a rigorous peer-reviewed process.</p>\n<p>Padilla was inspired to start the project after extensive work with humanities researchers, many of whom were interested in computational analysis. The project supports those who wish to analyze or download hundreds or thousands of documents at a time, as opposed to the traditional online viewing of one document at a time.</p>\n<p>The grant will help fund an initial two-and-a-half-day conference in March or April at UCSB with approximately 30 experts including librarians, researchers, technologists, archivists and museum professionals from various universities.</p>\n<p>Their goal is to identify challenges and suggest possible ways to “prepare access to digital library collections in a way that makes them easier to use” for computational analysis, Padilla said. Questions that need to be addressed include the form the collection should be in and the type of documentation needed to create such a collection.</p>\n<p>This conference will be followed by six conventions, including one with the Digital Library Federation in the next year and a half to refine ideas proposed during the initial meeting and to push forward in the development of the frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

election; Patterson performed poetry and spoke on black history. <em>Soham Tikekar / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Renowned minds in art and academia flew into Santa Barbara this week to discuss the concept of civility in the face of hatred and violence at UCSB Student Affairs’ newest series.</p>\n<p>Award-winning spoken word artist Sunni Patterson and David Kim, the department chair of racial and religious studies at Connecticut College, were invited to UCSB by George Lipsitz, a professor of sociology and black studies.</p>\n<p>A Tuesday night event was held at the St. George Family Youth Center in Isla Vista, featuring only Patterson, and a Wednesday night event included both Patterson and Kim.</p>\n<p>Kim said he accepted Lipsitz’s request because Lipsitz felt there was a “brokenness” to the culture of the campus.</p>\n<p>“There were incidents on the campus where racism and xenophobia were affecting the first-generation students,” Kim said. “We wanted to set a theme for the year about how might love be a way for the culture to heal itself.”</p>\n<p>Their goal was to promote conversation and help inspire creative work, in addition to “letting seeds grow,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>The Wednesday event was held in the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall in panel form. Lipsitz, as the host, asked questions while Patterson and Kim answered. The room was packed with students and visitors alike.</p>\n<p>“Love-driven politics” was Kim’s main theme. He talked about the resilience of love in the face of hate and power struggles in the political scene. Using his own upbringing as an example, he started off with a word of gratitude toward the organizers of the event. He said he hoped the same sincere gratitude would be present in the political sphere.</p>\n<p>Kim also talked about the culture of hate as perpetrated by the Trump campaign and the effects of such hate, including political gridlock in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of Paterson’s themes focused on her phrase “Freedom is now!” Using her cultural background for context, Patterson explored the history of African Americans.</p>\n<p>She recounted her visit to Ghana in the early 2000s, where she was told of the plight of early African slaves who were stowed on ships “packed like sardines” with only the ability “to move your head or a foot.”</p>\n<p>Another anecdote she shared was her own experience with pain, loss and lack of freedom during Hurricane Katrina. As a New Orleans native, she endured the storm personally, and it was the inspiration for much of her poetry. The idea behind the phrase “Freedom is now!” she said, is that one has to seize the moment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of

2016 – 2017 year. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students Senators began their time in office at the first Senate of the year on Wednesday after a delayed start for the new government in spring 2016.</p>\n<p>The last three of 25 Associated Students (A.S.) senators were sworn into office Wednesday, finalizing the approval of the A.S. Senate for the 2016-2017 academic year.</p>\n<p>Typically, new Senators sit in for their first meeting at the end of Spring Quarter, but such action was delayed by bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC) in the 2016 spring election.</p>\n<p>After A.S. Elections Board called for a revote, accusing the IFC of bribing its members to vote for specific candidates, the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department launched an investigation into the allegations. Then-A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal formed the Villarreal Elections Commission to process the Audit and Advisory Department’s findings while Senate was out-of-session in the summer.</p>\n<p>The investigation came to a close in May, finding no evidence of wrongdoing by the IFC. Twenty-two of the 25 newly elected senators were then sworn-in throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Unable to be sworn in with the rest of the Senate during summer, Unique Vance, Sabrina Divin and Aaron Hendizadeh made their pledges and officially took on their elected positions last night instead.</p>\n<p>With all its members finally approved, A.S. Senate ratified the decision of the Villarreal Elections Commission, which approved the findings of the Audit and Advisory Department’s investigation in May. Seventeen senators approved this motion, seven abstained from voting and one senator remains absent while studying abroad in Great Britain for the Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>Senate also unanimously approved a mission statement Wednesday, adding a milestone for the organization. In a draft outlining the measure to create a mission statement, Internal Vice President (IVP) Natalie Jordan said A.S. Senate had no established mission statement prior to Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The approved mission statement names the functions of the A.S. Senate to “represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body” and “strive to effectively address their concerns.” It also enumerates that Senate will “enhance student life” and “improve campus climate” while “remaining conscious” of the UCSB community, the environment and the University of California system.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/remaining-senators-sworn-in-at-first-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/remaining-senators-sworn-in-at-first-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/remaining-senators-sworn-in-at-first-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/remaining-senators-sworn-in-at-first-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/remaining-senators-sworn-in-at-first-senate/","id":2451,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2450,2449,2448],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Transfer Center Opens in the Library","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Transfer-Center-by-Christopher-Chen-PRINT-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Transfer-Center-by-Christopher-Chen-PRINT-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara held a grand opening for the transfer student center in the UCSB Library on Wednesday, celebrating a work in progress since the library opened doors in January.

Additionally, Padilla will be able to create tools that make it easier for researchers to organize information that is already available to them, such as email correspondence and documents in inaccessible formats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The installation of the six iMacs and three MacPros comes as part of the technology plan that came with the expansion of Davidson Library.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We feel that the Mac operating system is the best fit to accommodate for increasingly interdisciplinary coursework,” Rebecca Metzger, the library outreach coordinator, said. “It’s not unusual for a biology student to need a film editing program for a final class project, for instance.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Metzger, funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the biggest plans for the upcoming school year is to address the compact space issue inside the library. Over 250,000 people visit the library every month, and this is expected to increase with one of the largest incoming freshman classes in history starting UCSB in fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year, library staff will focus on adding furniture and expanding late-night study to other parts of the building. The second floor Mountainside will become available Fall Quarter for late-night hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Metzger said she is currently working with UCSB’s Health &amp; Wellness Center to obtain two egg chairs for the library that will help promote relaxation during the demanding academic year.</p>\n<p>According to Metzger, improving the learning commons is an evolving process, and the library staff is always looking for student suggestions regarding technology needs and furniture needs. Suggestions can be submitted at the wooden boxes on the services desks or by emailing <i>outreach@library.ucsb.edu</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Theater. Photo: The Varsity Bike Shop in 1997 <em>via La Cumbre archives</em></p></div>\n<p>One could hardly paint an accurate portrait of the UC Santa Barbara campus without including a few key details: hundreds of bikes lined side-by-side outside lecture halls, thousands of bikes filed bumper-to-bumper en route to classes and, occasionally, two bikes locked together when there is no space on the bike racks.</p>\n<p>George Misbeek, one of the founders of Varsity Bike Shop on Pardall Road, has provided service to UCSB’s bike-savvy students for over 50 years, and he has seen generations walk in and out of his doors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had so many customers — moms and dads who’d come in with their kids to buy bikes,” Misbeek said. “After several years, the children would come back to buy bikes for their kids.”</p>\n<p>Although Misbeek has seen a large chunk of UCSB bike history, the use of bikes on campus and in Isla Vista dates back decades before his time. It wasn’t until a series of “bike booms” in the 1960s and 1970s, however, that necessity for the human-powered vehicle came to physically shape the campus itself.</p>\n<p>Local historian Britta Gustafson said her impression is that bikes have always been part of Isla Vista, a small neighborhood that underwent development as early as 1925. With no running water or paved roads, I.V. “wasn’t a fancy place,” she said, and was home to many low-income families.</p>\n<p>Bicycles were cheap and popular, “like in any semi-rural beachside community with scattered houses and a bunch of kids,” Gustafson said.</p>\n<p>According to Dennis Whelan, associate campus architect, members of the United States Navy probably used bicycles between 1941 and 1944 when there was a U.S. Marine Corps base in place of the university.</p>\n<p>UCSB later moved into the former Marine base buildings, he said, and cyclists would ride on roadways and walkways or they would create their own dirt paths in what were “the very early and dusty days of campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72190\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72190\" data-attachment-id=\"72190\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/1-6-2013-first-day-of-winter-quarter-peter-vandenbelt-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C966&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,966\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter   Peter Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=888%2C536&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72190\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4-1024x618.jpg?resize=888%2C536\" alt=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter / Peter Vandenbelt / Nexus File Photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72190\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>There was a particular “cycle boom” amongst UCSB students in the 1960s, as noted by a 1964 headline in El Gaucho (a predecessor to the Nexus). The story reported 23 accidents and 659 bike thefts in the 1963-1964 school year, events that campus police considered a “major problem” to address the following school year.</p>\n<p>Misbeek took advantage of this “cycle boom” when he and two other friends started Varsity Bike Shop on Sept. 18, 1964, a date he quickly recalls today.</p>\n<p>The founder, now 87 years old, said bikes were well in use by the time he had set up shop in a building where “they hadn’t even got all the walls in yet.” He and his co-owners were “optimistic” of the store’s future; they anticipated continuing growth for the university, both in enrollment numbers and in the physical size of the campus.</p>\n<p>Some might say the optimism was well-founded. These were the years, after all, when the largest-ever generation at the time — the baby boomers — started their postsecondary education. A UCSB Planning data book indicates 4,865 students enrolled in the 1962 Fall Quarter, which increased to 5,938 students in the 1963 Fall Quarter and 7,879 students a year after that.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the campus underwent rapid expansion in size. According to Whelan, university developers completed six buildings in 1966 alone: the Engineering building, the Chemistry building, the University Center (UCen), Carrillo dining commons, Buchanan Hall and Phelps Hall.</p>\n<p>With a larger campus than ever before, Misbeek said walking to class quickly became inconvenient. Biking, he said, was increasingly necessary for students to arrive to class on time.</p>\n<p>Varsity Bike Shop could hardly keep up with demand. Misbeek remembers opening at 6 a.m. and working nonstop until as late as 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>He would buy several large containers of 350 bikes, “all of them black three-speeds.” It would only take about six weeks, he said, to sell an entire container of bikes, each priced from $39 to $49 in 1964.

Bikers rode on the sides of the walkways, where cyclists were supposed to be as indicated in a “set of regulations” posted in a 1963 El Gaucho article.</p>\n<p>The university developed the first stretch of bike path in August 1966, which provided travel along El Colegio Road between Francisco Torres (now San Clemente residence hall) and the campus pool. It was a “class one” bike path — a lane exclusively for bikes on the side of a shared road — and may have been the very first of its kind for Santa Barbara County, according to Whelan.</p>\n<p>“You can see a remnant on the west side of the track, opposite Student Health,” Whelan said in an email. “It is much-degraded asphalt now that appears to be a walkway.”</p>\n<p>The university continued to develop its bike system throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s as enrollment numbers grew and capital funds became available for the building of underpasses and bike circles.</p>\n<p>Of the several paths following the first, developers created a “central bikeway” in 1969 that ran east-west from the Student Health underpass to Kerr Hall. It was in 1970 that the university developed its iconic bike path, the Arts Mall Bikeway, running from Pardall tunnel to the Arts building.</p>\n<p>The campus bike system became especially necessary in the 1970s, a decade in which biking became even more popular than the one before.</p>\n<p>A Time magazine article, published in June 1971, reported on a national shortage of bicycles as the result of the “bicycle’s biggest wave of popularity in its 154-year history.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72189\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"704828842\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72291\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72189\" data-attachment-id=\"72189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/bike_lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=2000%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=888%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72189 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=888%2C493\" alt=\"Nexus file photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>The article notes that bicycles were seen as a solution for many groups of the time. Environmentalists chose them as a non-pollutant alternative to cars.</p>\n<p>“Physical-fitness fans” saw the bike as a “heart preserver.” Workers in “traffic-choked cities” would begin commuting on bicycles to beat rush-hour traffic.<br>\nUCSB was certainly not left out of the nationwide bicycle movement.</p>\n<p>Former California State Senator James Mills once made an 11-day bike trip from San Francisco to San Diego in September 1972 to campaign for Proposition 20, which eventually passed and formed the California Coastal Commission. One of the overnight stops for him and his group of cyclists was the Devereux House on UCSB’s west campus.</p>\n<p>As the 1970s progressed, the university added several stretches of bike path to its existing system. Among many other projects, the university built the segment between UCen Road and the Arbor in 1973 and the path from the Arbor to the south side of the library in 1977.</p>\n<p>In 1978, developers completed one of the final additions to the campus bike system: the bike circle next to Storke Tower. This is the same bike circle in which, during the opening week of fall classes, some students set up lawn chairs to watch new cyclists timidly navigate through the roundabout for the first time, hoping to see a crash.</p>\n<p>Today, UCSB has approximately seven miles of dedicated bike path, enough to provide travel for thousands of students, faculty and staff every day. For every year since 2011, the League of American Bicyclists has given UCSB “gold level” designation on its list of “bike friendly universities.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, bikes are so historically well received on campus, it makes sense that the bike racks are nearly always full. As reminisced in his song “Do You Remember,” such is the dilemma UCSB alumnus Jack Johnson ran into when he was “late for class” and could find no room to park his bike outside I.V. Theater. He saw the bike of a girl he met in Ortega dining commons (not the DLG as one might assume from “Bubble Toes”), the one with the “painted flowers on it,” and locked his to hers instead.</p>\n<p>But UCSB’s busy bike culture isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it won Jack Johnson a lunch date with the woman who would later become his wife.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 25, 2016 print issue of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72291\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72291\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/","id":2716,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2715,2714,2713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bribery Scandal Comes To a Close as Executives Are Sworn In","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Swearing-in-senators-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Swearing-in-senators-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students executive board for fall 2016 was sworn into office on Monday, culminating four months of speculation concerning bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC).","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72232\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Swearing-in-senators-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-8.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"721200883\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72243\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72232\" data-attachment-id=\"72232\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-22/bribery-scandal-comes-to-a-close-as-executives-are-sworn-in/swearing-in-senators-by-stephen-manga-online-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Swearing-in-senators-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Villarreal Elections Commission celebrates the swearing in of the new A.S.

The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server. The level of this spam only appears to be rising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said there are “hundreds of thousands” of spam emails sent to the university’s many departments daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s getting worse because it works … they can throw a message out there, and people click the link and give out their usernames and passwords,” McClain said. “If people didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be worthwhile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is always making improvements to the security systems in each department, but McClain notes in some cases it is easier to secure administration and business department emails on campus than academic departments.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The faculty typically wants things to be wide open, they want to be able to whatever they want to do … and the faculty have tremendous weight on campus,” McClain said. “So there are only so many things we can do to provide controls on systems used on the academic research side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horowitz sent an email to students Friday in response to the phishing attacks with suggestions about how to avoid getting trapped in a phishing attempt, such as being aware of who the email is coming from or what the email looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also advised students to be “skeptical” of messages that seem “too good to be true, the consequences [are] too dire [or there’s a] sense of urgency.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Sanchez and many other students refrained from giving their login information to the unsecure email sent last week. Horowitz said he hopes that with increased education about the danger of these phishing emails, fewer students and faculty will even consider opening the illicit messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important thing, [and] it needs to be dealt with,” he said. “This stuff happens, and you need to protect yourself.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/","id":2472,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2471,2470,2469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Allocates $3.3 Million to Increase Student Access to Food","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Juli Nguyen, who will begin her fourth year in the fall, has struggled with food insecurity since her first year at UC Santa Barbara.

She said she often found it difficult to focus on her schoolwork when she was so hungry that she felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>“One of my main concerns was worrying about not being able to focus on studying for an exam because I was hungry,” Nguyen said in an email. “It’s quite difficult to make the best out of your education when you’re focused on how you’re going to get access to your next meal [or] cook for your next meal.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen’s story is similar to the realities of many other UC students who find it hard to eat healthy and consistently with a college budget and rigorous student lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative.”</p>\n<p>— Juli Nguyen</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a spring 2015 survey from the UC, which was taken by 8,932 of 66,000 UC students, 42 percent of UC students struggled with poor quality food and insufficient sustenance in the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to the survey results, President Janet Napolitano announced Monday that she will allocate $3.3 million of the UC funds to help students struggling with food insecurity on behalf of the university’s Global Food Initiative. Each campus will receive $151,000 of the allocated amount.</p>\n<p>Among the focuses of the Global Food Initiative’s plan, the UC mentions the expansion of campus’ food pantry storage and access, an increase of student registration in CalFresh, the state’s nutrition assistance program and improved financial communication about the cost of food and living for students.</p>\n<p>Paul Monge, a UC Berkeley law student, UCSB alumnus and Student Regent designate, will work with Napolitano on projects to increase food security and said it is important for universities to receive more funding from the state rather than relying primarily on student tuition.</p>\n<p>“The university system is increasingly reliant on tuition and fees as their main source of revenue as opposed to state revenue,” Monge said. “The burden of paying for the universities … is placed on students and how that is translating is increase in prevalence of food insecurity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61697\"

funding support the food bank’s expansion, adding that the current lack of funding is “keeping us from providing more for students that need it the most.”</p>\n<p>The survey also showed that 57 percent of students who now go hungry did not experience food problems during childhood, making this an even more “serious issue,” according to Katie Maynard, the UCSB Sustainability Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Students may require additional information about crisis resources, financial aid, and making healthy choices on a limited budget” as they handle food inaccessibility for the first time, Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students do not feel comfortable seeking assistance on the issue, however, causing them to “struggle in privacy,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>“I think what many of us don’t realize is that hunger can happen to anyone at any single time,” she said in an email. “If you go into I.V., it’s packed with people eating delicious food at a bunch of restaurants, but we don’t account for the percentage of students who are currently at home and hungry.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said UCSB’s Food Security Task Force will manage the $151,000 allocated to UCSB and plan to prioritize more options for low-income students, including the Certified Farmers’ Market and associated Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life.”</p>\n<p>— Paul Monge</p></blockquote>\n<p>She also said the task force will hire eight students so they can analyze solutions offered at other campuses and expand existing programs.</p>\n<p>According to Monge, the cost of housing and food security is not typically associated with the affordability of college, which leads to a system wide lack of focus on students’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life,” Monge said. “We really need to reframe the narrative about what the university has responsibility over in terms of … students.”</p>\n<p>Despite being an upperclassman who uses the A.S. Food Bank, Nguyen finds herself struggling to make food a priority in her busy schedule. The news of the new UC initiative “excites” her and she hopes it will increase discussion about a battle that so many students fight each day.</p>\n<p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative,” Nguyen said in an email. “I’m glad that [food insecurity] is getting the attention it needs and I hope this attention becomes more and more public as we progress.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/","id":2471,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2470,2469,2468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":47,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
