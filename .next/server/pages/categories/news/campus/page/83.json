Candidates represented either the Democratic Process Party (DP) or the Open Peoples Party (OPP), and were each allowed a short amount of time to speak.</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding sexual violence on campus, OPP candidate Andre Theus said, if elected, he would unite the student body with various organizations on campus that address sexual assault issues.</p>\n<p>“Every day there are campus organizations that are working on this issue, but we need to once again unite and create a culture where UCSB is intolerant of sexual violence,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>DP Candidate Anisha Ahuja also said she would strive to allocate more funding for Take Back the Night and other similar committees in addition to prompting the university to address problematic web pages.</p>\n<p>“We also need to take a stand against things like UCSB Confessions and UCSB Hook-Ups that perpetuate the rape culture, and continue to educate people about things like consent and rape culture that are existent in our community,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>When the forum proctor asked candidates their opinion on funding for Greek life, DP Candidate Hani Tajsar said that the Greek community should be required to go through certain training before receiving school funding.</p>\n<p>“One goal that I would fulfill … is to require if Greek life is going to want to get funding from Associated Students that they go through safe-zone training,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Corey Lau followed by saying that he did not think funding for Greek life should necessarily be a top priority for A.S.</p>\n<p>“[Funding for Greek life] isn’t always something that should be necessarily pushed for,” Lau said. “We do have other issues on campus.”</p>\n<p>Later in the questioning, candidates were asked about the ways they would promote a healthier environment during large-scale events such as Deltopia and Halloween.</p>\n<p>DP’s Mario Vasquez said a major problem with big Isla Vista events has to do with inaccessibility to large portions of the student body.</p>\n<p>“It’s a travesty that these events aren’t for everyone, they’re not for all students,” Vasquez said. “It’s a travesty that I have homosexual friends, the queer community, that don’t feel safe walking around in pride festival shirts and are susceptible to hate crimes.”</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Jake Speyer said the school should continue supporting these events but place a larger emphasis on student safety.</p>\n<p>“I feel that we should start by saying that Deltopia and Halloween are traditions that UCSB holds and that we should absolutely not get rid of them,” Speyer said. “But with these traditions comes some things that we need to improve, such as infrastructure, education and awareness and community engagement.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the forum, candidates were asked to explain why they chose to run with their respective party. According to OPP candidates, their party policy — creating a new platform with every new group of candidates — allows for more original ideas and innovation. Several DP candidates said current DP senators have been more involved in the groups they were part of.</p>\n<p>Members from both parties emphasized their interest in diversity, each side arguing that their party represented every single UCSB student.</p>\n<p>Forums and debates will continue this week and the next. Still to come are the Presidential and Executive Officer debates, as well as the On-Campus Senator forum. Voting begins April 22 on GOLD.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 10th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50768\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50768\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/","id":3087,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3086,3085,3084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Proposal Sparks Nine-Hour Debate, Tabled as Each Side Stands Firm","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hundreds of students attended Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting to debate a resolution supporting divestment from companies accused of profiting from “the military occupation of...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hundreds of students attended Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting to debate a resolution supporting divestment from companies accused of profiting from “the military occupation of Palestine.”</p>\n<p>Talk of marginalization dominated the nine-hour discussion. Anti-divestment speakers argued that the proposed resolution would marginalize Jewish and Israeli students, while pro-divestment speakers insisted that the current investments have already subjected their community to marginalization. The exceptionally large student turnout forced the meeting to relocate to Corwin Pavilion in order to accommodate everyone, with a majority of the audience remaining at the meeting until adjournment at 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>The resolution, titled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid,” targets seven university-affiliated corporations including Caterpillar, General Electric, Northrop Grumman, Hewlett Packard, Raytheon and Motorola for supporting Israeli military and economic control of Palestinian territories. It calls upon the Associated Students Investment Advisory Committee, the University of California treasury and the UC Regents to divest UC money from each of the companies mentioned in order to defend human rights.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, who co-teaches a course on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with professor Walid Afifi and serves as the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the resolution might jeopardize the positive atmosphere that UCSB has created for its Jewish students.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have become a place that is very positive for Jewish students. When a campus like UC Berkeley or UC Santa Cruz is now under federal investigation for anti-Jewish activities … we are the exception,” Goodman said. “We are the exception for Jewish students; we are the exception for Muslim students, and for students of all different backgrounds, so I want to keep it that way.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said this resolution does not merely criticize the Israeli government, but instead attacks the state of Israel itself.</p>\n<p>“There’s one tiny Jewish state in the entire world,” Goodman said. “That the resolution undercuts that — and not something that’s simply critical of the Israeli government — is something that’s antithetical to what I believe in. To single out Israel as an apartheid state — if you can’t understand how that would make a Jewish student feel marginalized, I am flabbergasted.”</p>\n<p>Pro-divestment student and second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja countered the statement.</p>\n<p>“As a student who believes in human rights, I believe that without passing this resolution we are marginalizing students,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Third-year Hani Tajsar, one of the student sponsors of the resolution and member of Students for Justice in Palestine, rejected the idea that divestment or critique of the government was an attack on the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I find it very disheartening that I cannot attack the state of Israel without being called an anti-Semite,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>Goodman’s co-professor Walid Afifi of the communication department also spoke at the meeting in favor of divestment. Afifi said the Israeli government has broken international laws and should be confronted.</p>\n<p>“In the end, what I think we really need to pay attention to is that we have an occupation … which comes with a rule of law of what is required by the occupier,” Afifi said. “That rule of law has been violated repeatedly in extreme ways, in terms of human rights, in terms of international law.”</p>\n<p>In response to claims that some of companies targeted by the resolution may in fact work to protect Israel, Afifi said he would still support divestment.</p>\n<p>“If companies are both contributing to security and contributing to violations of international law … what I would argue is they should not receive our funding until they stop engaging in the activities that are explicitly violations of international law,” Afifi said.</p>\n<p>Many students in favor of divestment stated that divesting from these companies would not be choosing one side of the conflict but would in fact be an act of neutrality. Some, like student Rosina Saeed, said they were not advising reinvestment in companies that support Palestinian forces, but rather that the resolution advises divestment from the conflict as a whole.</p>\n<p>“By investing in this corporation, we have already taken a stance,” Saeed said. “We are not remaining neutral; we have picked a side.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Jake Speyer argued that divestment would be counterproductive to any positive negotiation that could potentially take place.</p>\n<p>“The situation in the Middle East is complicated, and divesting from American companies, simply because they build bulldozers, is not a step towards peace,” Speyer said. “We can be a model for negotiation on this campus … this resolution has already created a divide.”</p>\n<p>Several students standing against divestment took issue with the idea that the Israeli government violates human rights or international law. Some cited the official position of the United States government as an ally to Israel, quoting and showing clips of President Obama giving his support to the nation. Others, like first-year biology major Guy Singer, drew on personal experience, citing certain memories from his childhood in Israel as an alternative to the image of the country as an oppressive regime.</p>\n<p>“I remember walking to elementary school every single day with a gas mask in my backpack — gas masks required by the government — because there was a threat … I remember going to peace rallies with my mother, begging both sides to lay down arms … I remember the bomb shelters, I remember the sirens, I remember the explosions,” Singer said. “The picture I’d like to show today is a picture of Israel under attack.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Liran Braude contested the resolution by recounting his own experiences as a soldier in the Israeli army.</p>\n<p>“Israel is not comprised of only Jews … Jews and Arab Israelis, not only live together, but they are together in the workplace, and even in the home,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>According to Speyer, Israel promotes freedom in various ways, rather than restricting it, including the country’s support for the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>“In 2013, the independent watchdog organization Freedom House named Israel as the only free state in the Middle East … This is the Israel we want to share,” Speyer said. “Tel Aviv is the only place in the Middle East where you will find an annual gay pride parade.”</p>\n<p>The majority of the meeting’s discourse remained civil. However, despite constant efforts by the A.S. senators to create a welcoming environment, one student left the building in tears, and there were instances of expletives being directed at speakers. Neither side of the debate seemed willing to concede their stance.</p>\n<p>The Senate authors of the resolution — Miya Sommers and Genesis Herrera — urged their colleagues to table the resolution for one week in order to better understand every component of the issue. In the vote to table, 11 senators voted yes, 11 senators voted no, while one senator abstained, resulting in a tie. The vote then went to Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia, who agreed to table the resolution. Senators will therefore resume discussion on the resolution at next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1469831126\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50706\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/call-it-deltopia-weekend-beach-closures-confirmed/as_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50700\" alt=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>WILLIAM ZHOU / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Wednesday night’s Associated Students meeting lasted nine hours, as students discussed a solution to a proposed divestment from companies that allegedly benefit from the “military occupation of Palestine.”</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We hope to truly institutionalize this so it happens every quarter and expect it to grow and grow.”</p>\n<p>Organizers will be holding students’ books for them, and will be responsible for overseeing the exchanges up to the close of the market. Student book-sellers will have to leave a slip of paper identifying which books belong to them, Lakhani said.</p>\n<p>According to Lakhani, students do not have to be present for the whole event in order to take advantage of the opportunity to buy and sell books.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t want to stick around for too long and you’re a seller, you can leave your contact info so people can contact you,” Lakhani said. “And if you’re a buyer you can leave a wish list so if a seller comes back later he or she can contact you then.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Office of the President is hoping to encourage trade between students, as this event will reduce the amount of money that students pay for textbooks. Lakhani said that A.S. will not be dealing with students’ money whatsoever since A.S. is simply putting on the event to provide a safe environment for students to exchange textbooks with each other.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just a common time and place for students to do this safely. We are not handling any money or even doing any trades for anybody.

Organizations including UC Student Association, Cal State Student Association and the Student Senate for California Community Colleges were all in attendance at the event.</p>\n<p>The Nexus held a Q&amp;A with Associated Students President Sophia Armen, who attended the rally and lobbied legislators alongside other UCSB students.</p>\n<p>So specifically, what were the goals of the rally?</p>\n<p>“This event, specifically, was looking at actually the governor’s proposal for the budget, which essentially maintains the status quo of a sincerely underfunded University — which after years and years of severe cuts, has essentially made going to college unbelievably unaffordable and inaccessible for students.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the increased funding provided by Prop 30 — which passed in November — is a short-term and unsustainable solution to the University’s ongoing fiscal woes.</p>\n<p>“Even though there is a five percent increase to the operating budget of the UC [through] Prop 30, UCSA … essentially was saying that a Band-Aid solution like Prop 30 — which really just came from the people of California, not the politicians … is not enough, because the status quo of paying almost $15,000 per year to go to a public university, for many students — especially middle income students and working class students — is just impossible.”</p>\n<p>How do you think Prop 30 has changed the state-level conversation regarding the funding of public higher education?</p>\n<p>“What I think that’s really important is that we’re looking at a climate that is very different, in terms of student organizing … It was students who really made Prop 30 happen. UCSA, which is all of the UCs combined, registered over 51,000 people to vote and not only that, but our campus actually registered over 11,190 people to vote — the most in the entire nation…”</p>\n<p>The passage of Prop 30 relied on the activism of student groups at both the campus and statewide levels, according to Armen, who said state lawmakers are now more aware of the political impact of student voters.</p>\n<p>“We made Prop 30 happen, which, historically in California, is pretty difficult. So what we have now is, we have quite a lot of our representatives — our politicians up in Sacramento — really seeing the numbers that we brought out, and essentially seeing the importance of listening to a very large youth vote.”</p>\n<p>But while students may hold a stronger voice in Sacramento, the state’s public higher education system continues to be underfunded, leaving the majority of its financial burden on students.</p>\n<p>“The reality is the status quo is not acceptable. The status quo is unjust and there is a very specific campaign — on the part of not only the UC, but the state — of very real public divestment from our UC system, and then essentially a campaign of shifting the weight in the University of California of the burden of funding fully on the backs of students, which has never been a reality for public education in CA like it is right now … The importance of Prop 30, though, is this is not where we stop; this is actually where we begin because now is the time where we actually have very rare breathing room where, for the first time in my four years, we don’t have a fee increase up on the table. We can actually talk about not only freezing tuition, but actually rolling back the obscene tuition increases that have essentially not only been a campaign of the state, but of the Regents as well.”</p>\n<p>What kind of future do you see for Cal Grants?</p>\n<p>At the lobby conference, UCSA made efforts to improve funding for the Cal Grant B award.Armen said the student group co-sponsored AB 1365 — a piece of legislation authored by Phil Tang which seeks to increase these awards up to $1,550. According to Armen, Governor Jerry Brown decreased these awards to $1,473 in last year’s budget through a blue pencil veto.</p>\n<p>We know you’re fighting for accessibility and affordability, as well as more need-based aid. How do you plan to implement these goals? What were short-term and long-term goals for this rally?</p>\n<p>“The reality is essentially since 2001, there has been $900 million worth in cuts to the UC system, so what were calling on — in the state of California — is to actually provide the basic human right of education to its residents … This is not a crisis of funding, and I think that’s the most important thing to hit home. This is a crisis about priorities in the state of California. We actively, at UCSA, learned about where our money is going at the statewide level and it seems that we have an addiction of locking up the residents of California over educating them.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the distribution of state funds does not adequately reflect the needs of California residents and consequently, has left university students like herself with mounds of debt to deal with upon graduation.</p>\n<p>“I think the important thing to understand is how exactly we prioritize our society and what we prioritize in our society, especially when were hearing ever-more important discussions about the economy, about the job market — which for me, I am now entering with over $80,000 in debt, graduating in June.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the short-term goals of student lobbying, Armen said it is essential for students to combat state initiatives like Governor Brown’s proposed unit cap — which would not allow students to take over 275 units without additional charge — as well as his ongoing push for a UC online education program. Armen said online education has been continually been pushed by the governor’s agenda, despite its clear lack of popularity with students.</p>\n<p>“[With] this online education experiment — which…the UC Regents are being forced to invest tons of money into — we’re not seeing students overjoyed by taking online classes. As a matter of fact, the educational experience that you would receive is definitely disturbing for how much you’re paying. The reality is online education is really not a replacement of in-class instruction.”</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 5th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Jonathan D.

SCORE focuses on any issues regarding students of color on campus and helps fund over 100 UCSB multicultural organizations, according to SCORE Co-Chair Navkiran Kaur.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, this weekend’s conference was one of the group’s most important events of the year.</p>\n<p>“We fund the delegation of UCSB students to go to the Student of Color conference which is an annual statewide conference,” Kaur said. “The other huge thing we do is this Facing Race conference, which is our own UCSB-wide annual conference.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, violence was chosen as this year’s topic due to the prominence of issues like gun control and terrorism in national discourse.</p>\n<p>“We felt violence was a very prevalent topic in today’s time, what with the professional violence that occurs in India, the different issues with gun control going on, terrorism, like so many different ideas of violence, it’s not just that mainstream idea of a gun,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>One of two guest speakers, Outreach Coordinator and Santa Barbara Unified School District consultant Ismael Huerta spoke on the importance of family ties and secure communities for future generations as a way of avoiding the spread of violence.</p>\n<p>Along with the set of lectures, SCORE held 16 different workshops available within three distinctive time ranges throughout the day. A workshop on the growing trend of terrorism as a method of violence hosted by A.S. Outreach Coordinator for Human Rights Board Will Ellis entitled “Who’s the Real Terrorist?” detailed the classification of certain groups as terrorists and the various outcomes that have resulted from creating stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lizeth Lomeli attended Ellis’s workshop and various other lectures during the event after learning about Facing Race through Womyn’s Commission. According to Lomeli, learning about terrorism from the point of view of those who have been wrongfully discriminated against opened up her perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was super interesting because I’ve never gotten that point of view from, I guess, people who have been called terrorists or have faced issues in post-9/11 aftermath society,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Another workshop, “Migrant Realities” explained immigration policies from the past and their effects on the immigrant population of today.</p>\n<p>“I have parents who are immigrants and it was really interesting to hear those points of views from students who are undocumented now and just the bravery and courage that it takes for them to continue being in school and in an environment where they are risking everything to somehow better themselves,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Attendees were also able to utilize caucus spaces, which served as meeting rooms for students who were interested in specific topics such as Mixed Heritage and Womyn of Color. Along with the guest speakers, workshops and meetings, Facing Race included entertainment at the end of the day’s events featuring Mexican folklorito dancers, SCS Zhangra Punjabi folk dancing and Iaorana te Otea traditional and modern Polynesian dances.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and French double major Jonathan Fackler, a member of the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity, participated in his fraternity’s singing performance at this year’s Facing Race.</p>\n<p>“We were doing the performance and we thought ‘hey let’s check out the event and support our fellow fraternity members’, and it turns out, you know, this event was really well-coordinated,” Fackler said. “There were a lot of people, a big supportive crowd, food, snacks, the performances were amazing and it was really entertaining.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> This article appeared on page 6 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/","id":3082,"author":{"id":198,"name":"Carly Bates"},"related":[3081,3080,3079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

These forms will then be sent to the Director of Accountability in the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Miya Sommers, who authored the bill, said the goal of the action is to implement a more efficient system for ensuring that senate members are performing their duties to the best of their abilities.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja, a proxy for Off-Campus Senator Genesis Herrera, added that the bill will hopefully resolve what she perceives as a general lack of effort on the senate’s part.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people here … haven’t been doing the job with the power they were given to do this. They’re not holding office hours … they’re not going to the meetings and getting involved and taking students’ voices into account,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Several senators brought up concerns with the ambiguity of the bill. According to Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni, the provisions of the bill will not necessarily lead to the desired effect.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like this bill does what it says it’s going to,” Cianni said. “It doesn’t feel like a transparency issue … I just feel like we already do this each quarter with [applications for] honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said she would like to see more clarification of what particular information would be required on the evaluation form before making a decision on the bill.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t feel comfortable passing something when I don’t know what it’s going to look like,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Senators voted to hold a twenty-minute working meeting, in which they could offer their suggestions for the bill without adhering to the formal meeting procedures. During that time, Sommers discussed the language of the bill in order to clear up some of its more vague pronouncements. Senators passed the revised bill in an 18 to 3 vote.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed the progress of the proposed taxicab program, which would allow UCSB students to charge cab fares to their BARC accounts. External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia, who spearheaded the project, said the next step in the process will be choosing a company to partner with.</p>\n<p>“We’re at the point now where we can put a bid packet together and subsequently choose a taxi company,” Siordia said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a motion to push back the start of their weekly meetings from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in order to better accommodate Senators’ class schedules.</p>\n<p>After adjourning last night’s meeting, Senators went into a closed meeting for an hour. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss personal matters and reduce some of the negativity and contention that has been building among senators over the last few weeks.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/","id":3081,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3080,3079,3078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The Executive Board also jointly proposed to tack on additional changes that would allow Elections Committee to disqualify candidates for ethical reasons.</p>\n<p>Elections Committee Chair Hannah Yen said the revisions were made after the committee conceded that imposing a limit on the recruitment period was not realistic.</p>\n<p>“In the recruitment section, recruitment is no longer having restrictions,” Yen said. “We don’t want to punish people. And realistically, if it’s happening, then we want to allow for that in the code … We are trying to do the best we can to accommodate what we think is best for the students and for you all.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja said dropping the additional changes would result in the committee not holding parties accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like you’re addressing that there is a problem and basically just conceding to that,” Ahuja said. “I’m kind of confused about how this actually solves anything.”</p>\n<p>Yen said her goal is to make the elections process as open to student involvement as possible.</p>\n<p>“Different violations come up, different campaign strategies come up,” Yen said. “So we are always trying to make the process as fair and impartial as possible, and as open as possible and accessible to students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the Executive Board’s proposal would give Elections Committee the power to disqualify students for the use of A.S. funds for personal affairs, the deliberate and public misrepresentation of the association and other ethical issues.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Yoel Haile said the responsibility to ensure that candidates were indicted for ethical violations fairly would lie with the Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“We believe this to be the baseline … of what kind of ethical parameters should elected folks be held to. We’ve thought very long and hard about this,” Haile said. “If the Judicial Council finds that the student is responsible for violating these codes as the baseline, that Elections Committee be empowered to disqualify that student.”</p>\n<p>Many Senators brought up concerns with the proposal. Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said it should be in the hands of the students to judge the character of each candidate, rather than the association.</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t the student body be the ones deciding the moral standards of their leaders, not this code?” Scarlet asked.</p>\n<p>Yen said the Elections committee does not endorse the Executive Board’s proposal.</p>\n<p>“The Committee does not want this in our code because we do not feel that this is part of our charge,” Yen said. “I hope that you take into account the fact that this is not something we wanted.”</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, External Vice President of Local Affairs, said the new ideas came about as a result of issues that have occurred in past elections.</p>\n<p>“This is indeed a response. It would be a response to historical precedent,” Siordia said. “Has [an infraction like the ones mentioned in the proposal] happened in the past? Yes.”</p>\n<p>After hours of debate, including a ‘working meeting’ in which the Senate abandoned the restrictions of the official meeting process and talked through the ideas in a circle on the floor, Senators passed the changes proposed by Elections Committee, but did not approve the ethics requirement proposed by the Executive Officers.</p>\n<p>After the Senate passed a resolution that would support CALPIRG in an effort to repeal the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC, three Senators exited the room abruptly, leaving the Senate without the requisite number of members present to adjourn the meeting. Next week, Senate will resume where it left off in this week’s agenda.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/","id":3111,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3110,3109,3108],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"EAB Petitions A.S.

Ultimately, the students and other supporters involved in these efforts hope to gain the approval of the UC Board of Regents in endorsing a system-wide movement.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major Emily Williams, who is campus coordinator of statewide affairs for EAB, said the group first introduced the proposal at last Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. However, due to opposition from many A.S. members, the resolution was postponed until a later meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams said she hopes to gain student support in lobbying for the movement, allowing UCSB to join almost 200 universities and colleges across the U.S.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing else in the policy that says how we should invest our money other than to maximize the profit and minimize the risk, and to me that seems wrong,” Williams said. “If we claim to be sustainability-focused and if we claim to be progressive, how can we be invested in an industry making profit off the suffering of others and the degradation of our environment?”</p>\n<p>UC campuses divested from Sudan during the genocide as well as from South Africa during apartheid, so it would seem appropriate to essentially boycott fossil fuel-based companies, which inflict on public health and the environment, according to Williams, who added that fossil fuel divestments particularly affect people in communities near natural gas or coal processing plants.</p>\n<p>In regards to last week’s Senate meeting, UCSB sociology professor and co-director of the International Institute of Climate Action and Theory John Foran said the petition aims to address a multifaceted issue with far-reaching effects that are not apparent at first glance.</p>\n<p>“This is an education process,” Foran said. “It’s not an easy issue to get your head around — it’s something that’s very huge. It’s in many ways invisible, and in many ways it’s coming at us from the future.”</p>\n<p>Foran also said the marginal financial effect posed by divestment pales in comparison to the looming catastrophe that could result from fossil fuel-induced climate change.</p>\n<p>“There is a limit of carbon dioxide we can afford to put into the atmosphere,” Foran said. “The existing proven [carbon dioxide] reserves of the fossil fuel industry are five times the amount that will push us over the limit.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the campaign could take time to catch on due to the technical complexity of the proposal, which includes terms such as “endowments” and “marginalized risks.” Despite this, Williams said he hopes that even schools that have partially divested from fossil fuels should be praised for sparking the conversation about the movement on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think once people get to know, ‘Okay, we’re just talking about investments in an industry,’ people get very passionate about it,” Williams said. “I can see the campus getting really riled up — students, faculty and staff — I see them talking together … Let’s work with the Regents.”</p>\n<p>Foran said many adversaries of environmental reform lack credibility because they skew information to fit their own agenda.</p>\n<p>“There are going to be people trying to scare others, and that’s really the only argument they have,” Foran said. “We know that the fossil fuels industry has a well-documented record of countering any criticism, and they’ll do that by any means necessary … to distort facts and to lie outright.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, the UC is not deliberately invested in the fossil fuels industry and thus, its progressive image will not be marred with divestment. In reference to an article by Chief Investing Officer Patrick Geddes of the Californian money management firm Aperio Group including a study indicating a negligible effect on UC revenue in the case of fossil fuel divestment, Foran said pointing out environmental issues without action would be “hypocritical.”</p>\n<p>“In some of the studies I’ve seen — and I’m sure we’ll see more studies — [fossil fuel divestment] makes very little impact on the portfolio,” Foran said. “It doesn’t harm the holdings of the university and it doesn’t therefore go against any responsibilities of the investment people to maximize income — I’m talking percentages of a percent.”</p>\n<p>According to UCSB philosophy graduate student and environmental studies teaching assistant Quentin Gee, the UC system as a whole has slipped from its place at the leading edge of responsible investing.</p>\n<p>“Universities have actually gone from being the leaders of responsible investing to sort of following on the coattails of other foundations,” Gee said. “We just want the investment group that the Regents oversee to think creatively.”</p>\n<p>Gee also said several smaller colleges have managed to divest and even larger institutions such as Harvard University have been active about putting the issue on the table.</p>\n<p>“Even though you can make money off of something that is fundamentally unsustainable and detrimental to our health, population and environment … doesn’t mean you should,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>EAB’s fossil fuel focus group plans to host a teach-in to further inform students about the divestment campaign sometime in the upcoming month.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50150\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50150\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/","id":3122,"author":{"id":204,"name":"Adam Courtin"},"related":[3121,3120,3119],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Organizations Will Compete for Funds Created by A.S.

Groups will compete for the funds, with the two best project proposals receiving $5,000 each.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, the architect behind the legislation, said the federal failure to invest in innovation initially inspired him to propose the fund.</p>\n<p>“NASA has no funding now. The United States is ranked 22nd in science and technology. That’s appalling,” Martinez said. “We can’t compete with countries on the rise like India and China when it comes to this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, having student government support the sciences would help rekindle the innovative spirit of the United States.</p>\n<p>“$10,000 isn’t a lot, but it helps a bit,” Martinez said. “It helps contribute to people wanting to do something outside of the classroom and hopefully be like, ‘Maybe I can work on this for the federal government in the future.’”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, president of UCSB’s Residence Halls Association, added that STARK allows A.S. to support and reach out to science and engineering students.</p>\n<p>“Students who work in the science-technology field on campus are really underserved by A.S.,” Abboud said. “A.S. does a lot to benefit certain groups, but one of the groups that A.S. hasn’t aided to — as much as other groups — is the science population.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the lack of dissent the bill faced from the Senate signified the widespread acknowledgement of its importance.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see a lot of engineers and we don’t see a lot of hard-science people in A.S.,” Martinez said. “A.S. has no form of grants that we give to projects. It’s time that we do that. It’s time that we reach out to those people who want to do hands-on projects … There was no opposition [from the Senate]; I think that shows that people understand the issues at hand.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, who serves as an off-campus Senator for A.S. and officially proposed the bill to the Senate, pointed out the advantages that STARK could have for students attempting to pad their résumés.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this is a great direction that A.S. is going into, because … we’re also helping career paths,” Lau said. “Really when it comes down to it, your résumé is kind of everything.”</p>\n<p>Lau said she hopes to eventually expand the idea to other fields of study, making student government funds more accessible for academic pursuits.</p>\n<p>“It would really help to expand it to even writing groups — people who are English or art majors who want to publish art magazines and writing magazines,” Lau said. “It’s a great avenue to have money specifically for students to do things that will benefit their future.”</p>\n<p>However, Abboud said he feels that it is most important to address science-focused organizations, since these groups are most underrepresented in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We kind of already do fund different things … I don’t think that we should create another fund specifically for them,” Abboud said. “It’s better to have a specific one for science and technology, because they don’t feel right now that A.S. helps and caters to them … It’s good to put that institutional backing to the science groups.”</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez plans to contact every Office of Student Life organization that is science-related within the next week as the beginning steps of the $5,000 competition. The bill will go into effect next year.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/","id":3109,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3108,3107,3106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition to other topics, student representatives debated the benefits and drawbacks of oil company divestments, while also measuring the fiscal downside to divesting from companies that emit fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Emily Williams, who acts as the statewide affairs coordinator for Environmental Affairs Board, requested the senate’s support in divesting from businesses with larger carbon footprints.</p>\n<p>Williams said the board is pursuing the support A.S. since they plan to take their proposal to the Board of Regents. She said it is necessary for the senate to set an example in such environmental efforts since UCSB holds such a strong reputation as a ‘green’ campus’.</p>\n<p>“It is almost hypocritical, in a way, for us to be invested in fossil fuels,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez, chair of Finance Board, questioned the fiscal impact of EAB’s proposal, saying it is inevitable the university turn to these companies.</p>\n<p>“Companies, firms, non-profits — they all have investments in portfolios and most of them have chairs in Exxon or Mobile. The reason is because it pays dividends,” Martinez said. “If you don’t have a company that pays that kind of dividend … that money needs to come from somewhere.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Martinez said such financial losses could translate into higher costs for students.</p>\n<p>“So either there are going to be cuts, or tuition is going to increase, or whatever they want to do,” Martinez said. “Universities need revenue now more than ever.”</p>\n<p>As the discussion wore on, off-campus senator Alex Choate asked how the senate could find the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>“So I was wondering — is there another away that we can incorporate this, remaining socially responsible?” Choate said.</p>\n<p>In response, Martinez said senate members should take concerns for human rights into greater account than environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be invested in companies that are in oil and energy, so long as they don’t violate human rights,” Martinez said. “This is going to sound really bad … but I’d rather be socially responsible to the students than to the environment.”</p>\n<p>However, Williams said ecological issues are equally important since they overlap with various other social issues.</p>\n<p>“By degrading the environment, it affects frontline communities,” Williams said. “People … whose water is polluted, who are experiencing more and more cases of asthma, of cancer — these are real things that are happening.”</p>\n<p>The plan would not be costly since the UC Regents would ensure transitional costs not reach the pockets of students, according to Williams.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson disagreed, saying past Regents decisions have not represented students.</p>\n<p>“I am going to have to disagree with you a little bit when you say that the regents prioritize the students first,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Without reaching any conclusion regarding the divestments, senators shifted their focus toward A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Senators Tuquan Harrison and Hayley Gilbert proposed a plan to restrict the elections recruitment period to two weeks to allow for more “transparency.”</p>\n<p>However, some senators said restricting recruitment time would make it more difficult for party members to find the most qualified students, amongst other concerns.</p>\n<p>The senate agreed to table the bill for one week so they could eventually reach a more informed decision.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kaur earned the position by merit of her status as the next runner-up by number of votes in last spring’s A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Several members of on-campus organiza- tions came to the public forum portion in sup- port of revisions to the A.S. constitution, which would include additional training requirements for senators in order to better prepare them for dealing with sexual harassment-related issues.</p>\n<p>Alex Moore, Co-Chair of Take Back the Night, offered his support for the new requirements. He argued that a trick- le-down education approach would greatly benefit the general student body by setting an example for other campus organizations.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to start a change in the culture from leader- ship down,” Moore said. “I highly encourage you to add the requirement.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair Danielle Bermudez echoed this sentiment, adding that an informed population of students would go a long way towards preventing sexual crimes.</p>\n<p>“Education — that’s the first step to ending sexual vio- lence,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate about a UC system-wide campus climate survey called “Answer the CALL,” which is designed to gauge various measures the campus atmosphere in order to bet- ter prevent discrimination and hate crimes. Armen said she would like to see a 40 percent response to the survey, which was distributed to every student through U-Mail, but so far, only about 10 percent of the student body has responded.</p>\n<p>Armen said she believes low participation results may be a result of the uncertainty surrounding survey’s purpose. “Part of the reason why there has been an initial student reluctance … is because of [students wondering,] ‘What are we going to do with the data?’” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Armen stressed the importance of filling out the survey by the deadline of January 25th in order to add representative student input to potential university changes.</p>\n<p>“Whether or not you do take it, they are going to use the information,” she said. “If you don’t take it, it’s not going to represent you.</p>\n<p>Following Armen’s report, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Nadim Houssain spoke before the Senate about financial concerns for the University of California system and potential structural changes to the institution.</p>\n<p>Houssain said Proposition 30’s passage helped make Governor Brown’s recently proposed state budget a little more optimistic for the UC than it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>“Thanks to the passage of Prop 30, the government has followed up on its promise to contribute 250 million dollars to the UC system,” Houssain said.</p>\n<p>Houssain said he was unsure whether the allocation of a portion of that money towards online education is a worthy investment for the university.</p>\n<p>“What really concerns [me] is the complete online education,” Houssain said, contrasting “complete” online education with supplementary online materials to tradi- tional classes. “Not everyone has access to a computer or the internet … This shift would put grad students [who work as TAs] out of work … How do you enforce academic integrity [through online courses]?”</p>\n<p>Houssain also noted the possible negative effects that implementing online courses — which currently range in price from $1,400 to $2,400 — will have on lower-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may stratify students based on class,” Houssain said. “Those with more money will be able to afford in-class education while those in lower income brackets will opt for cheaper online classes, and I wouldn’t want to see that happen.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 24th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Additionally, Patel and Gallegos also attributed their respective resignations to an inabil- ity to balance senatorial duties with other responsi- bilities.</p>\n<p>In a debate about meeting length, Kennedy claimed lengthy meetings were an impor- tant factor in the overwhelming number of resignations.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already had one third of the Senate quit for this reason,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Senator Ben Green, who does not plan to quit Senate, noted the weight of their responsibilities, taking the absence of Senate members at the meeting as a sign that the senators were being worked too hard.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of empty seats and that’s indicative of the stress the Senate puts on us,” Green said.</p>\n<p>Segovia announced during that same meeting that she had met with A.S. mem- bers from other UC campuses and had been surprised to learn that none of them had dealt with resignations.</p>\n<p>While last week’s bill to cut off meet- ings at 9:45 p.m. did not pass, Senators did resolve to brainstorm ways to make meet- ings more efficient and thus less stressful. Nevertheless, the four resigned former- senators were not persuaded to remain.</p>\n<p>In light of last night’s resignations, Off- Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson</p>\n<p>delivered an emotional address stating her personal frustration toward the situation.</p>\n<p>“This is killing me. This is ridiculous,” Christianson said. “I think everyone in this room can tell how much it’s affecting us.”</p>\n<p>Christianson continued to argue that meetings were in fact getting shorter as everyone had begun to become acclimated to their positions.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better at it. Our 4:00 a.m. meetings were the first few meetings of the year,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>She then called for more honesty between senators and implored them to remember their duties to the student body.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, I want us all to be honest with each other. Please be hon- est with the Senate,” Christianson said. “Remember why you ran for this. Why are you here? It’s a big friggin’ deal … You have so much more power than people who want to make a difference … We have to be that outlet when people have grievances.”</p>\n<p>The new resignations leave several open seats in the Senate. If the people who received the second-highest number of votes in last spring’s elections do not choose to fill those spots, the Internal Vice President will be forced to begin a new application process.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 17th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/","id":3106,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3105,3104,3103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

According to Choate, there are currently a total of 26 lights with bulbs needing replacement and eight areas identified as insufficiently lit, including portions of Camino Corto, Estero Road and Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>According to Choate, the primary task the project involves is documenting and reporting the numerous missing or obstructed lights to Southern California Edison, which is then obligated to file working orders to have these lights fixed. The group eventually hopes to make this assessment an official duty of the EVPLA Office or hold periodical ‘lighting walks’ to monitor the situation and keep SCE accountable for repairs, Choate said.</p>\n<p>Choate said there is no statistical data showing that lack of lighting leads to more crime in certain areas, but based on the information the group has collected the possibility of a link seems likely.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see if there is a correlation between crimes that have occurred in certain areas and the lack of lighting in I.V.,” Choate said. “I actually was one of the people who walked the streets and took down all this information as to which lights are out, and from what I’ve heard and what I’ve seen from the emergency alerts, there’s a pretty good chance there will be a correlation.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks Department Board of Directors member Sawyeh Maghsoodloo said the lack of lighting is a serious detriment to the safety of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“When it’s dark, it’s easier to get away with crime. Studies have shown that in more well-lit areas, crime rates do go down, especially in regard to sexual assault,” Maghsoodloo said. “These are problems we do have in I.V. Undeniably, we do have lighting issues — a lot of the lights haven’t been replaced in who knows how long. Replacing them is one easy step we can take to not only increase safety but to also make residents feel safer, which I think is also important.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD is working extensively with the group to find ways to implement additional lighting.</p>\n<p>According to EVPLA Rhandy Siordia, the project has also prompted Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr to compose a letter addressing the problem, which will likely be signed by A.S. members.</p>\n<p>“The county is being supportive and willing to sign a letter to send to SoCal Edison, and they’ve become a very enthusiastic partner in this project,” Siordia said. “I really, really am pleased to see that because you don’t see areas like Montecito that have dim lighting areas, where [the] population isn’t as transitional as our college community.”</p>\n<p>The group is looking into raising funds that will finance solar lighting or new transformers to install in particularly problematic areas, Siordia said.</p>\n<p>“Estero Road has no lights at all. That’s very sad that there are community members on that street who for whatever reason do not have any lights there, and it’s dangerous,” Siordia said. “It’s a basic need that we realistically shouldn’t have to be fighting this hard for, but we’re going to fight hard for it nonetheless.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/","id":3105,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3104,3103,3102],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":83,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
