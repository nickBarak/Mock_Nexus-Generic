The bill will require a two-thirds vote from the student body during the upcoming spring elections to be implemented; if it passes, the seats will be added to the 72nd Senate for the 2021-2022 school year, not the incoming 71st Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, the bill was written with the intention of replacing one off-campus senator seat with one international student seat to ensure Associated Students (A.S.) Senate remained at an odd number. Keeping the Senate at even numbers would give the internal vice president a significant amount of power if a tie-breaking vote was held, a concern that both Ferguson and Swanson expressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the bill was amended during the Senate’s Jan. 22 meeting to increase the number of international student senator seats from one to two, instead of removing an off-campus senator seat.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Based off of the statistics I was hearing, I didn’t understand why we were only adding one senator and decreasing representation for other students,” Kimia Hadidi, the off-campus senator who proposed amending the bill, said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was amended and passed after a lengthy discussion in which some senators, such as On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, expressed concern over the potential decrease in off-campus senators. He further discussed how the bill could possibly open the doors to other groups on campus asking for Senate seats designated specifically for them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus after the meeting, Foreman expressed worry that “the Flying A Room can only fit so many people,” and that if more seats were to be added, the Senate should find a way to restructure itself as to ensure that it can still logistically function with a larger governing body.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the Senate is composed of: five on-campus senator seats, 12 off-campus senator seats, six representatives at large, one university-owned housing representative and a transfer student senator.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant amount of support for the bill came from international student groups, such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). According to the UCSB 2018-19 campus profile, 12% of all UCSB undergraduates are international students, and 73% of international students at UCSB are from China. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB undergraduates, including international students, pay student fees which go toward funding for entities such as A.S. For the 2018-19 school year, UCSB undergraduates each paid </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,854</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in these student fees, according to the UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships; in the same school year, the A.S. Senate received just under </span><a href=\"https://budget.as.ucsb.edu/files/2018/05/budget18-19.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$12.5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million in student fees. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating an international student senator [seat] can definitely allow us to have a say in how the money is distributed and make sure that our money is used well and fairly,” Hanrui Feng, vice president of the CSSA, said during the meeting.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student has never sat on the A.S. Senate at UCSB, but the bill notes that other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles and UC San Diego, have “equivalent” roles for international students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that this will contribute to expanding crucial opportunities for international students in A.S.,” said Charles Neumann, the internal chair of the A.S. Global Gaucho Commission and one of the bill’s 20 student sponsors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann added that he considers an international student senator crucial to “breaking down social barriers between international students and domestics, and a path forward in addressing these previously overlooked crucial interests.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

federally-funded educational institutes — focused on cases of sexual misconduct and violence on UC campuses and what the UC Title IX offices have done to address the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reviewing what the UC Title IX office has done over the past six years, a panel of individuals working in the UC Systemwide Title IX department and on specific campuses took questions from the UC Regents.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Student complaints have increased significantly since we put the [Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment] policy in place in 2016, and [the state auditor] connected that increase to better training and student outreach

legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. <em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no public questioning of the group’s practices until</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SBStudentActivistNetwork/posts/rock-the-vote-sb-has-been-caughtrock-the-vote-sb-has-been-masquerading-for-month/1810602312406454/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Facebook post </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published on Jan. 11 by the Student Activist Network alleged that Rock the Vote SB was not a legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rock the Vote SB stole the logo of a nonprofit that has national recognition for being a nonpartisan, get-out-the-vote effort. They then set up a nonprofit and used that branding of that trusted nonprofit, basically as a way to say that their organization is objective and is to be trusted,” said Ry Brennan, a member of the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> representative from the national Rock the Vote organization confirmed that Rock the Vote SB was formed in August 2019 as a part of the larger organization, but as of now is “not a legitimate chapter.” They also said that the national organization sent Rock the Vote SB a cease-and-desist letter in December.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Rock the Vote SB Executive Director Robin Howe explained in a statement that Rock the Vote SB was a compliant chapter with the national organization beginning in August 2019. In November, he was told that Rock the Vote DC “received complaints” regarding the Rock the Vote SB operation. Rock the Vote SB initially “wholeheartedly attempted to work with them to bring our operation into compliance,” he said, but was asked by the national organization in December to “drop our affiliation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB then “immediately ceased operation[s],” Howe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe added that the Student Activist Network’s allegations –– which included that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote in I.V. by encouraging online voter registration, telling people their car insurance would go up if they voted in Isla Vista and that the group encouraged people to vote at home instead of in I.V. ––  were “misleading and unverified.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations of voter suppression not only relate to Rock the Vote but also alleged ties to Bruce Porter, a candidate running for the third district seat in the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors March election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said that in August 2019, he responded to a post on the Rock the Vote SB website that stated the group was hiring. He then was “introduced to and met briefly with Bruce Porter,” who “mentioned his intention was to create a non-partisan voter registration group in Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter Porter sent to his supporters on Jan. 15, which was obtained by the Nexus, Porter discussed Rock the Vote’s alleged intent to cause low voter turnout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Congressman Salud] Carbajal and [Supervisor Joann] Hartmann went all out to crush the nonpartisan voter registration effort in Isla Vista and shotgun accusations of voter suppression,” Porter wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, Rock the Vote has done a fabulous job of providing truthful and objective voter registration education to students. The result: far more students chose to register back home and there are 1400 fewer students registered to vote in IV this year, compared to this point in 2016, even though the student population has significantly increased.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe told his staff in an email sent on Jan. 15 that operations were “on hold for the moment” due to “local political issues.” Howe told them in the email to refrain from wearing their T-shirts and doing any branding and to delete all social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were left without a clear reason why all operations had ended out of nowhere as Howe instructed staff to tell current and potential volunteers “the schedule is full and no more volunteers are needed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Rock the Vote SB volunteers spoke to the Nexus, saying they had no idea that the organization was illegitimate until this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a post on Free and For Sale that was basically just trashing Rock the Vote for all these allegations,” said Sean Price, a first-year pre-biology major. “At first I didn’t believe it, but then I found out that the website was gone, Facebook was gone; I haven’t checked their Instagram, but I’m sure that’s gone too. I didn’t hear anything from them when this all happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second-year volunteer, who asked not to be named, said that they tried to reach out about changing their shift day for winter quarter and never heard back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I did get was an email about there’s been stuff going on this week with tabling. So I had no idea basically what was going on until I read an article on Facebook about that it could potentially be a fraudulent organization … they stopped tabling, and then just nothing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Activist Network raised three separate allegations against Rock the Vote SB accusing them of voter suppression in Isla Vista. The group alleges that Rock the Vote gave out voter registration cards at the Arbor instead of filling out physical forms, that they told people their car insurance costs would increase if they registered to vote in I.V. and that they encouraged people to vote at their home addresses in other parts of the state instead of in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers who spoke to the Nexus confirmed that official registration forms were “rarely” provided for tabling in favor of voter registration cards that directed people to the Rock the Vote SB website, which has since been shut down, to register to vote on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the eyes of the Student Activist Network, handing out cards makes it less likely for students to register to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have tabled many times at the Arbor and I know that students are often walking by very, very quickly. They often take things that are handed to them and then immediately throw them away,” Brennan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best way to actually get somebody signed up to vote is to actually ask them to come over to your table and fill out the form. That is the only way that you could actually guarantee that the people who you have actually gotten to bring over to your booth are actually going to follow through … We only complicate the process when we ask people to go online to fill out forms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said in a statement that Rock the Vote SB encouraged online registration but “ALWAYS carried hardcopies of voter registration cards for those who preferred that method which we found to be rare because Gen Z generally is a digital culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One second-year volunteer, who requested their name not be used, said they were confused about why voter registration forms were not the norm but didn’t deeply question the practice because they believed Rock the Vote SB to be a legitimate organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel really frustrated because in retrospect looking back, things were sort of red flags,” they said. They added that they were made familiar with the organization through a UCSB honors mail listserv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just never assumed that through an honors mail listserv that an actual, illegitimate thing could be presented to us students,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another allegation raised by the Student Activist Network was that Rock the Vote SB told students that their car insurance rates would go up if they registered to vote in I.V., which they heard from multiple students who Rock the Vote SB volunteers had spoken with, but Howe rejected that claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never heard of the concept of car insurance rates getting raised nor did anything remotely close to that ever get discussed with my team,” Howe said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This claim is the most bizarre of them all. It is so obviously unbelievable it waves a red </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flag as to how low the people spreading these dishonest statements will go for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their own political gain.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No volunteers that the Nexus spoke with had ever heard of discussions about car insurance rates increasing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final issue raised by the Student Activist Network is that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“dissuading people from registering in IV on the grounds that other elections in the Bay, LA, and San Diego are more contested,” according to its Facebook post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backside of the Rock the Vote SB online voting card obtained by the Nexus, the card reads that “It’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choice Where to Register,” whether that be at home or school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The card’s wording did not raise alarms for Price until this past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are three places on the card: Los Angeles, San Diego and Bay Area issues, but nothing in Santa Barbara, like no reason to vote in Santa Barbara, and then there’s websites to each place about those issues,” Price said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It basically just said vote where you think your opinion matters more, like where you’ll make a difference, which is basically what I told people and what I thought was being advertised by them, but now I’ve heard that it’s not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no further information from Howe or Rock the Vote SB in general, student volunteers for Rock the Vote SB have been left confused about where the organization stands and remain frustrated by new information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything looked very legit and no interactions that I had with anyone were bad. They were all just pretty straightforward. I was just to get my volunteer hours, so that’s really frustrating for someone who was trying to have volunteers actually make a difference and register people to vote and that’s important to me,” one volunteer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t help beating myself up, like why didn’t I, like, think this was a bigger issue at the time?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I’m waiting for more information to come to light because I feel very taken advantage of,” Price said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured I was doing something to help voter registration and improve community involvement. And if that’s the opposite of what was happening, then that’s the exact opposite of why I joined this.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

although advocacy group UCSB 4 COLA stressed that Wednesday’s action was just the first step in a larger COLA movement and not a formal strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students at UCSC have been on strike since Dec. 9, 2019 and have been calling for a COLA of $1,412 per month </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/campaign-timeline/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since September</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The “sick-out” on Wednesday was planned to coincide with a UC Regents meeting, in which the UCSC strikers planned to address the UC Office of the President directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Wednesday demonstration focused on the parallels between the challenges faced by UCSB and UCSC graduate students, such as steep housing costs, and the high number of students at both schools who are considered “rent-burdened,” meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income toward rent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the UCSB Graduate Student Association took an informal poll of roughly 600 graduate students and found that respondents, on average, spent 48% of their $2,091.98 monthly income on rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers said that the “sick-out” was meant to draw attention to the COLA movement and gather support from graduate and undergraduate students who may not be aware of the movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s people [here] from [the Graduate Student Association] …  but this is really a separate movement that grad students have started,” said Emily, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event who declined to give her last name. She explained that the group was mostly composed of union members from UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Similar to Santa Cruz, this is grad students coming up, standing up and saying, ‘What we’re dealing with now is unacceptable,’ and so we’re really following their lead on that,” Emily added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling in sick on Wednesday, close to 150 graduate students and supporters marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor, chanting, “C-O-L-A, we need fair pay!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in the Arbor, several graduate students spoke to the crowd and to students who stopped to watch the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of you may be wondering why grad students are rallying today … it’s because of the immense hardships that we’re facing. We can choose to keep our heads down and go on with business as usual. Or we can speak up about these hardships,” Rammy Salem, a graduate student in the psychological and brain sciences department, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of us are homeless. Some of us skip meals. Some of us have to work multiple jobs and still work paycheck-to-paycheck,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive — that ain’t right. So if you agree that grad students deserve to live dignified lives, support the movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers called for the support of undergraduate students, staff and faculty as well, stressing that “it’s not just grad students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pratik Raghu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Global Studies, said to the crowd that he was at the demonstration because he knew he was just “one serious medical accident away from potentially losing [his] apartment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all out here because we know that we are past the point of asking nicely. Asking nicely doesn’t do shit,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So let’s be a little less nice to the university — in fact, let’s be a lot less nice in making these demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raghu said in an interview afterwards that he was “nothing more than a participant” in the demonstration, although he felt compelled to speak to the crowd in the Arbor because he is an international student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would hope that we can continue to show strength in numbers as we did on this particular occasion, and I hope that we can come up with a collective program of action that can help us maintain that strength in numbers,” Raghu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other international graduate students spoke to the Nexus about the restrictions they face due to their visas and how that can impact their ability to support themselves throughout the year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Tudisco — an international graduate student in the comparative literature department — said that international students in particular are struggling because their visas do not allow them to work for any employer other than the university, excluding a select few </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student work programs. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If UCSB decides not to employ me over the summer, I cannot work somewhere else,” they said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Kagan-Moore, a graduate student in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, said that graduate students as a whole struggle over the summer when there are fewer teaching appointments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had a couple of health issues that essentially bankrupted me this summer,” Kagan-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because we make so little as instructors of record and as TAs, that has had an extraordinarily deleterious effect on my ability to do my own research and my ability to serve my students. It is a holistic problem and the amount of labor that we render to this institution should be compensated,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wednesday’s demonstration, organizers said they plan to regroup to begin drafting demands. Emily added that the demonstration was designed to involve more people in the discussions so the meetings are “as representative as possible of the grad student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were chatting, we were creating community, because [this demonstration] is a thing of creating community among graduate students,” said Azucena Trincado</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a graduate student in the Spanish and Portuguese department. “In graduate school, you feel kind of isolated or separated in departments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, for [the university], it’s good to maintain us divided, and we are showing that we can unite,” Trincado said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 10:19 a.m.]: A previous version of this article said that speaker Rammy Salem said “<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us think the cost of learning is way too expensive.” The article has been corrected to reflect that he said “Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive.” </span></em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 5:27 p.m.]: A previous version of this article referred to Tudisco with the wrong pronouns.

Courtesy of Dahlia Hylton</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last March, Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide funding from his office for the creation of the office, the hiring of eight staff members — of which Hylton is the first — and $55,000 annually for programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the creation of the office, Yang said that the development of a Center for Black Student Development, which is meant to be a standalone building, would be “an important priority within campus planning.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the BSU demands team in February and fulfilled by Yang in March but were built upon over 50 years of activism from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton was selected after a national search by a committee comprised of members of the BSU demands team, as well as other campus leaders, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Academic Support Systems Lupe Navarro-Garcia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton said she hadn’t heard about the demands before she saw the job announcement, but that she was aware of “some type of forward movement that was happening, as to why this office was being created.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I’m someone who literally stands on the shoulders of people who look like me, and to be able to be a vessel, if you will, for the amazing work that this institution has done,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students have played such a significant part in bringing this office together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, a job posting by the Division of Student Affairs described the role of director as an individual who is both capable of overseeing and advising entities — such as the Black Resource Committee and Black Student Union (BSU) — while leading in strategic planning and participating in organizations from the local to national level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The search committee wanted someone that really understood the diversity within the Black community and really had a commitment to intersectional identities and making sure that everyone that set foot in the place where we have that space, or was interfacing with anyone with the office felt welcomed, seen and understood,” said Meridith Merchant, assistant director for Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion for Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and member of the search committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia noted that Hylton has worked in various multicultural affairs offices at different campuses and at her most recent university, Lehigh University, grew the office from one person to a full staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the work that I have done, particularly within higher education, has been around diversity and inclusion,” Hylton added. “Even when I was cultivating those skills in undergrad and graduate, I just always gravitated towards a space like this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton noted that she has worked in advising offices, Educational Opportunity Program offices and admissions offices in addition to her work in multicultural spaces and said she’s looking forward to working with various offices at UCSB to help students in any way they need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to hold true to the demands that the students brought forth and however that actually manifests its ways, then we’ll actually do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Hylton said she’s focusing her time on learning what exactly the needs of the student are, and how she can help facilitate them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first few days, she said she spent time getting to know a lot of different people on campus and building relationships, which she described as key to a position like hers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to meet, in my opinion, with some really great, great allies, or potential allies, of the space, and everyone seems so excited, which has given me a lot of energy,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, she’s ready to get to work creating a strategic plan for the office and begin hiring other staff members.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia said they have already hired an assistant director who will begin Feb. 3, and are in the process of looking for an advocacy counselor and an administrative business officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As OBSD moves forward in filling positions, Merchant said “we have to be very intentional and thoughtful” in making future hires, as to meet the BSU demands and properly accommodate new employees as they arrive on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have space in our suite here for the first tier [of hiring]?” Navarro-Garcia said. “And then we need to start thinking where are we moving to advance to the hiring of tier two and tier three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Merchant emphasized the need to continue developing OBSD’s infrastructure in an effort to make future employees feel they can perform their job to the fullest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Barbara is not the most diverse place to be. UC Santa Barbara is diverse, but Santa Barbara as a whole [is not],” Merchant said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re inviting people to positions where they’re going to be supporting multicultural students, it’s important that there is the infrastructure, so that you can draw people that will feel supported and be able to continue to do the great work that they’re doing,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hylton, she’s looking forward to doing just that. In the future, she hopes to help create a space where Black students can seek “empowerment, education and inspiration,” while providing them with the resources they need to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important that UC Santa Barbara realizes that Blackness isn’t monolithic. There’s so many different variations as to who we are as individuals. And to have this office to a vessel or a conduit to helping people understand what those many different nuances of Blackness is going to be really important.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

That was the night of the Isla Vista tragedy, an evening so devastating that it brought an entire community to its knees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista lost six of its own that night, while 14 others were injured. For a brief period of time, nearly everyone in Isla Vista could recall where they were that evening. But in a town defined by its high turnover, first-hand experiences diminished as students graduated, leaving business owners and long-term residents to bear the grief.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92151\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1487152071\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92146\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92151\" data-attachment-id=\"92151\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/student-documentary-not-one-more-puts-a-story-of-tragedy-in-the-hands-of-community/courtsey-of-cameraon-leingang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=1535%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1535,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cameraon Leingang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-92151\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?w=1535&amp;ssl=1 1535w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Not One More” aims to retell the story of the Isla Vista tragedy from a “survivor-based” angle. <em>Courtesy of Cameron Leingang</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to bring the first-hand perspective back into focus, a new documentary called “Not One More” aims to retell the story of the Isla Vista tragedy from a “survivor-based” angle that excludes the attacker’s name from the narrative, according to fourth-year film and media studies major Cameron Leingang, who is the documentary’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documentary’s narrative is instead established through interviews with politicians, UCSB faculty, psychologists, researchers, first responders and surgeons, giving viewers a previously unseen perspective into the events leading up to, during and after the Isla Vista tragedy, Leingang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media has already done a great job of making sure that [the attacker] has been the focus of this event. So that is the last thing we’re going to do,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t know the victims’ stories. And if they did, people forget about them,” said Lexi Lunchick, a senior film and media studies major and the documentary’s producer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they’re now confident in the film’s direction, with a bulk of its interviews already completed, Leingang said that he and Lunchick initially struggled over the summer to conceive a pitch for their Fall Quarter 2019 film class, which, if selected, would extend their class into Winter Quarter 2020 for the filming of the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We weren’t really sure what we wanted to do, but we were still meeting frequently to talk, knowing that we wanted to pitch something,” Leingang said. “And then, this summer, we had a really bad string of mass shootings. There were three within a week — El Paso, Dayton and the [Gilroy] Garlic Festival right nearby.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it just kinda clicked that it was like, ‘Oh, this also happened here. Maybe this is something that needs to be told,’” he added. “That was kind of the spark.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the idea for a film in mind, Leingang, along with Lunchick, teamed up with fourth-year philosophy major and director of photography Alex Gorman, second-year film and media studies major and production manager Perris Burnley, second-year film and media studies major and editor Ily Logeais and third-year film and media studies major and sound mixer Aidan Mastrogiorgio to produce the documentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before getting a chance to pitch the film, Leingang said he first had to enroll in a pitch session during fall quarter. To do so, he, alongside 27 other students with pitches, raced to send in their pitches when the submission portal went live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whoever had the fastest computers — you’re in,” Lunchick said. “Only 13 [students] got into the actual pitch session, and in the first 60 seconds alone, there were, like, 23 applications,” Leingang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang’s submission made it to the next round. Now flanked by his movie crew, Leingang said he competed against the 12 other teams in an on-stage pitching competition for four spots before a panel of judges that was comprised of industry professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If selected, Leingang said the team would have the opportunity to produce their movie during Winter Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pitches happened on a Friday and they said that [the results] would get posted midday Monday,” Lunchick said. “We were sitting in class in Pollock [Theater] and we were told it was going to be [released at 12 o’clock] but one of the judges was late giving their answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got up to go to the bathroom to go see if it was posted and my professor yelled at me to sit down,” Leingang added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon after, Leingang and Lunchick saw a Facebook post from their film and media studies group chat that announced which four groups would go on to produce their films. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the people posted the picture of the names of the four that got picked. As soon as we got the notification, we quickly looked and then saw that ours was on there,” Lunchick said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Leingang and his team began planning out interviews shortly after the pitching competition, he said they faced a problem early on: They “had no credibility; we’re just a student film.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang said he reached out to Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and graduate student Melissa Barthelemy, who is writing her dissertation on the Isla Vista tragedy, to help assemble sources. UCSB also aided him in contacting the victims’ parents, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the other crews started filming very quickly, which was panicking at the beginning,” Leingang said. “But once we started rolling, we had names on our film of people who are respected and people who have stories … we’ve had great success with almost everyone we’ve reached out to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following pre-production, which took about five weeks, Leingang said the team then began filming in mid-November. By mid-February, Leingang said he aims to have all the filming completed in anticipation for its release sometime in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While conducting interviews, Leingang said he and his team were always sensitive to the grief their subjects were experiencing but was surprised by how “open and willing” people were once the interview began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, the very first thing they say to me is, ‘Thank you for doing this,’” Leingang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of our interviews was just talking about how it’s good to talk about [the tragedy] every once in a while,” he added. “People are finding it cathartic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a broader sense, Leingang said the film’s narrative has been heavily shaped by what has been gathered through interviews: “very strong personal stories” that built an understanding of “what they experienced that night, what happened and what happened the next day.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the team conducted interviews — which included a mid-quarter trip to Kentucky — Leingang took note of a common thread expressed by many people who spoke on camera: “What a lot of our interviews have stressed so far is a call for sanity,” in that many people are still overcoming the shock associated with the tragedy.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Lunchick, filming the documentary has been a learning experience, in part because working on the film has exposed her to the changes in Isla Vista since the tragedy, such as the bushes planted at sorority Alpha Phi after two women lost their lives there.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that future generations of UCSB students are always going to be affected,” she said. “You never know if one other student walking by knew someone or their sibling that went here before knew someone.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Leingang said he came out of producing the film with a new sense of appreciation for life and how quickly things can change in the wake of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve emphasized this the entire time; you don’t really think it’s going to happen to you or where you live and then to actually have it happen and to you,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We interviewed someone who was supposed to hang out with the girls that ended up being killed. They made a last-minute decision to do something else and if she would’ve continued hanging out with them, who knows what would’ve happened. Stuff like that, it’s eerie, and it sends chills down your spine.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the film makes its initial debut as a 30-minute final project for Leingang’s two-quarter film class, he and Lunchick said they hope to produce an extended version — an hour-long “documentary feature” —  to submit to film festivals in hopes of drawing more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling all the hardships, memories and interviews experienced while producing the documentary, Lunchick said she finds herself returning to the time she and the team flew to Kentucky to interview Bob Weiss, who lost his daughter, Veronika, in the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that we realized while we were there is just how one decision of where you are at one point can just change everything for everyone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there, Lunchick said she had the chance to flip through a photo album that Veronika Weiss had made before she died. Though they had never met, Lunchick said she felt a connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s hard to sometimes believe that such tragic events really happened,” she said. “And it’s moments like that that really stick out and once again feel surreal with it all and put it into perspective that this event was real.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Veronika touched this. We’re holding this book that’s hers.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 23 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

</span><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers, including UCSB students and community organizers, gave speeches on their personal experiences with racism, institutionalized oppression in higher education and the importance of allyship. The procession of approximately 100 then walked to North Hall, stopping at the mural that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968, before ending at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) for lunch.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee of Santa Barbara, UCSB’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the MCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Hudley, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, elaborated on the importance of the theme “Remembering The Silence of Our Friends,” which comes from the famous King quote: “We remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During political years, we have forgotten to have conversations,” Hudley explained. “We want the idea of people having conversations, learning and collaborating, to build inclusiveness and equality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion of friends in conversation was emphasized throughout the event; participants were asked to talk to strangers during the walk about the change they wish to see in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Frick-Jenkins, president of UCSB’s Black Student Union, discussed the Eternal Flame monument, where the walk begins. The Flame was donated as a gift by the UCSB Class of 1968 to commemorate peace and unity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the Eternal Flame … commemorates the ongoing legacy of MLK because he lit a similar flame under Black students to take under North Hall and demand equality. I find it important for Black students and those who understand their struggle to not only see the monument as one to MLK’s legacy but also one about taking up space in this institution,” Frick-Jenkins said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frick-Jenkins’ ideas of “self determination, Black freedom and liberation,” which were recurring themes throughout the event, led to a discussion of empowerment in institutions of higher education like UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take up space here,” Frick-Jenkins told attendees. “We can see ourselves within this institution that was not inherently made for the education of Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deandre Miles-Hercules, president of the Black Graduate Students Association, touched on their personal experiences as a Black, gender nonconforming individual and, similarly to Frick-Jenkins, their struggle with taking up space in academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is important for me personally, because I am Black and gender nonconforming and as a scholar that is not often a comfortable place to be, and in the world that it is often dangerous and harmful to be in,” Miles-Hercules said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MLK said direct action is presenting our very bodies to the conscience of the public of our national and local communities,” they explained. “My presence and showing up authentically is direct action. That too is walking in Dr. King’s legacy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While talking to the crowd, Miles-Hercules also emphasized how their presence at UCSB is statistically unlikely. In the 2017-18 academic year, only 3% of graduate students were Black, whereas 5.8% of California residents were Black, a nearly 3% difference between state and university demographics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent Elect and UCSB graduate student Jamaal Muwwakkil, another speaker, reiterated this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m a poor kid from Compton, California. The statistics are against me … I was not supposed to gain access to the UC. The paradigm for Black students is that diversity lowers standards, that the more Black students you have, the lower the ranking of your school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anne H. Charity-Hudley, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and linguistics professor, encouraged attendees to discuss with others what made them come out to the event on their walk to North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miriam Bankons, a participant who has been coming to the event for five years, was eager to share her answer to Charity-Hudley’s question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here in memory of all the people that came before me and walking for them,” she said. “Talking to other people that we don’t know, that we don’t see, is a way to honor King. His holiday is about a day of service, and I believe this is a way of service.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the march reached North Hall, Charity-Hudley recounted the racism she has experienced while achieving success in academia, including being targeted by police and having drawings of lynchings painted on her wall after receiving a raise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many positions, people are happy to see Black people on campus until they receive raises, labs and support.

Out of rent burden; and To parity with grad students at UC Riverside,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students have refused to upload grades to Canvas — a learning management website similar to Gauchospace — since Dec. 9, 2019, the first official day of their strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB Graduate Student Association passed </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEd_O-dZ_KCut7HQHeEHoxHLlOwbCxkyZngRN1VaD5Y/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of the UCSC strike at its  general meeting on Jan. 14, stating “unequivocally [their] full support for [their] fellow graduate students at UC Santa Cruz in their demand for a cost of living adjustment (COLA), including their engagement in a Wildcat Strike.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike is a “wildcat” strike, meaning that it does not have union approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The vast majority of graduate students spend more than half of their paychecks on housing, with many going to extreme lengths to make ends meet,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Cruz grads’ decision to withhold grades is a brave and an ingenious use of our power as graduate students. The UC only works because we do, and our compensation should both reflect the value of our labor and account for the high cost of living in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA, the advocacy group calling for a COLA for UCSB graduate students, began circulating an FAQ regarding the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GnQx0HSjGBotw6WJoBn34oxs3gYuXVbwbtCo3MdPUo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sick-out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ckhIm4A2rCsKdbzlDcP6WyQ_aHPZkGhdFj58NN2Ti8/edit?fbclid=IwAR1jGycg1x3IvhGiGUw8wASVrMWTSf3_n5_zfj-fOUxPMaYzFtSTfPO-Vvs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a whole, stressing that Wednesday’s action was not a formal strike but instead the beginning of “a COLA movement of [their] own.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will collectively draft a list of demands to give administration, and if those demands are not met, then we will discuss the possibility of a strike with the graduate student body,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in the COLA FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not pursue a strike unless we decide that it is a necessary action and graduate students support escalation of that sort </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there will be plenty of opportunities to express your opinions on the matter each step of the way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheila Kulkarni, a Ph.D student at UCSB and an organizer with UCSB 4 COLA, said that UCSB graduate students decided to engage in the sick-out in part due to their own struggles with the cost of living in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, UCSB graduate students put 48% of their income toward rent, putting them within just a few percentage points of the 50% threshold considered “severe rent burden” by the Office of Housing and Urban Development, according to a survey taken by the UCSB Graduate Student Association last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea would be a disruption of regular classroom activity,” Kulkarni said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students, on average, would need an additional $1133.57 for their rent to equal 30% of their income, according to an informal UCSB GSA survey, which Kulkarni said measured roughly 500 of the 2,906 graduate students. That survey also measured that UCSB graduate students make on average $2091.98 a month.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of the sick-out, UCSB 4 COLA held a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss logistics regarding Wednesday’s demonstration, such as what route the march would take, what signs to make, what slogans to chant and what committees to create. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Wednesday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kulkarni emphasized that UCSB graduate students must be the ones to decide whether or not to engage in further labor actions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really up to everyone if they want to go on strike, it’s not something the GSA can decide,” Kulkarni said. “It’s something all grad students have to decide.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/","id":3360,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[3359,3358,3357],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force Launches New Website for Student Well-Being","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-UCSB-Student-Wellbeing.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-UCSB-Student-Wellbeing.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara’s Mental Health Task Force launched its new Student Wellbeing Website — a place for students to access resources and support for their mental health and well-being.

The most recent trip took place over this past winter break and brought students to Texas, according to Alec Valdez, who serves as the alternative breaks co-coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy major, said alternative breaks fit the model of Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) as a whole: serving the local community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point [C.A.B.] came up with the idea of doing a program that went … out of the state of California. It’s a great program because it allows you to go outside of your comfort zone, outside of your culture zone,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B.’s free week-long volunteer trips are held during winter and spring break, and the group also holds a weekend trip during spring quarter. According to Valdez, Community Collaborations International (CCI), a private organization dedicated to setting up alternative break programs, helps C.A.B. set up the trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCI offers different locations and programs, Valdez said, and his job as co-coordinator is to look through the programs and pick which one works best, alongside making efficient use of the funds available — a task that takes all quarter to plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past winter break, the trip’s participants traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to help with the immigrant community there, Valdez said. He explained that this trip wasn’t “the first time we’re doing social justice work as opposed to just disaster relief,” noting that participants traveled to Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The destinations for each trip vary widely, ranging from Florida to Oregon, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/past-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B. website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students applying to be a part of a volunteer trip, however, are kept in the dark regarding the trip’s location — it isn’t until after they have been accepted that participants are told where the trip will be, Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big thing is that curiosity because when we put out the applications, they don’t know where they’re going yet. We leave that until the very end when we pick our final team,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/cab-alternative-break-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative breaks website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each program often gets an average of 200 applicants, but only 10 to 12 students are selected to go on the trip. Valdez emphasized the importance of selecting people who are willing and determined to volunteer, given how the trips are made possible by student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Valdez said that they are currently working on a smaller version of the alternative breaks: alternative weekends that would take students out of Santa Barbara into the wider California community to places such as San Francisco or Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just a vacation trip we’re going on. We’re doing service,” Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure that people who are going on this really value the opportunity and are putting in that effort to see that they really do want to be a part of the team and be a part of the project. We do value effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Valdez, C.A.B.’s work can vary depending on wherever it is needed most. Both Valdez and Cassandra Zhou, a fourth-year psychology and brain sciences major, attended the 2019 spring break trip to Wilmington, North Carolina and helped families rebuild their homes after Hurricane Florence had passed through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working at an animal shelter one day which had been overrun by abandoned and lost animals. They usually serve somewhere around 70 animals or 60 animals in that area. But then after the storm, they had like 150 animals on the property,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhou, the service trip allowed her to expand on her own local volunteering and provide support to people outside of her area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to do a lot of these things where you interact with different communities and you learn how to communicate with them and how to talk to them,” Zhou said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like volunteering gives you more of a purpose. I also typically don’t travel and alternative breaks with an amazing opportunity to travel for free, meet new people and contribute to a community that really needed help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

She worked with the Persian Student Group to quickly plan the vigil in only a few days, calling it a “multi-group effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar holds the loss close to her heart as she personally knew victims in the crash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to remember every single life that was lost. It wasn’t just the life — that life had a family, that life had a mom, a dad, a sister, professors, friends,” Abrishamcar told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I myself, my family had a close family friend that passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar wasn’t alone in mourning the loss of someone she knew personally. Farhad Kaimi, a community member at the event, said he attended the vigil to “pay respect for the people who died.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a friend who I knew from middle school and high school. We weren’t close friends but he was on that plane,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature, spoke entirely in Farsi at the vigil. Second-year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gevirtz doctoral student Sepi, who declined to disclose her last name, spoke immediately after Feiz, translating Feiz’s words to English for those who didn’t speak Farsi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are here to pay respect to these victims … as many of you may have heard, a lot of these victims were students and professors, just ordinary people who were visiting family and friends in Iran and never made it back home,” Sepi translated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were kids, newlyweds, whole families, even, who perished,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the vigil, Sepi emphasized the importance of creating an event that is accessible to everyone, regardless of language. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last week, there was a lot of heightened tension, there was a lot of political tension and we are gathering today to honor the lives of innocent victims that were basically as a result of those tensions … I wanted to welcome our non-Iranian friends who gathered with us in solidarity of the lives of the victims who were innocent and who died last week,” Sepi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar echoed this message — that lives lost always need to be remembered, above any political or religious differences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in the climate that we have in Iran right now, it’s very hard to find unity,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has different beliefs and religions and political preferences, but it’s important to have this vigil to remind the people of Iran, in Iran and outside of Iran, that at the end of the day, we are all Iranians and we have to remember these 176 lives that were lost. Their death[s] should not be cluttered with the politics that’s going on right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the vigil, Feiz recited traditional Persian poetry, a cultural custom often performed during times of mourning, according to Abrishamcar, who said there are specific ways to both sing and pronounce the verses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the group joined together in singing the Iranian national anthem, the vigil ended as it began — in the glow of the candlelight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iran is a country of many religions and many cultures. We’re not all Persian, we’re not all Muslim. There’s Jewish people, agnostics, atheists, Baháʼís, Zoroastrian people,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But Persian culture is so different. Persian culture goes back thousands and thousands of years. And that’s what unites all of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Persian Student Group plans to host another vigil mourning the victims on Feb. 18.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He shared their annual report with me and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to do this.’ And that’s been my goal from when I started here,” Olowude said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Olowude said C.A.P.S. has been organizing its data — gathered in Excel sheets —  and consolidating it with other universities in the UC system, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of work [in the] unification of our data to make sure that what I’m calling something, someone on another campus is also calling it [the same thing],” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterns revealed in the data collected will allow C.A.P.S. to pinpoint the cause of any dips in the number of visits, Olowude said. The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families. Well, when they’re here, they don’t have to and it’s confidential,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these students in particular, C.A.P.S. created the position of assistant director of Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion. The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing. I’m very proud of the staff that we’ve been able to compile that work here.

He said that he attracted users over to the new subreddit by simply telling people on the current page to come transfer over, promising a better moderator presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, Boe worked in a team of three, including UCSB alumni u/beetling and u/Rlight. The team has worked hard to make the page “a place for inclusion” — where r/UCSantaBarbara members could come together and help one another, according to Boe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, that “place of inclusion” has grown substantially. In the last eight years, the number of submissions to the page has grown by nearly 500%, according to a post detailing the number of annual submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the page has become so popular that Boe and his team have found it hard to maintain the vast community on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been rather amazing watching this subreddit grow from an initial 50 to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers. However, lately, we’ve noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we’d prefer,” Boe detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the page’s growth, Boe posted a callout to the Reddit community in November, encouraging UCSB students to apply to become a new moderator and work alongside the current group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the callout was posted, Boe announced in a later post that month that two new moderators, fourth-year pharmacology major u/thejappster and third-year biological science major u/swimming_legend, had been selected. Both new moderators asked to be referred to only by their usernames, citing privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boe said the two new moderators stood out in the selection process because they were some of the most active people on the page. Their post history met Boe’s and u/beetling’s standards for the position and they both appeared to be students who genuinely cared about the UCSB Reddit community, Boe added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/thejappster said he used the subreddit to help him navigate his time at UCSB — researching classes, asking for advice and staying up to date on news in the community. As a new moderator, he said his focus is on promoting healthy discussion on a wide variety of topics, like local events and what professors or classes to take, and to encourage people with different views to express their opinions, as long as they are not attacking each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can get tricky in stressful situations, such as when the Thomas Fire occurred near campus three years ago. The stress of the situation led to an influx of content and information that was difficult to aggregate, u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, u/thejappster said the subreddit was meaningful to him because of the people who engage with it since they are often students, alumni or people who just live in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They really care about the subreddit and really care about helping people,” u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/swimming_legend joined the sub his first year at UCSB and said he hasn’t regretted it for a second. He said he uses the page for academic advice, social connections and a good laugh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although u/swimming_legend said he has not been a member of the Reddit page as long as the other moderators, he felt proud to have been “a member of a community that … has a positive impact on its members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said he is excited to implement new ideas for the page and create a more friendly and helpful experience for its users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new moderator team has already hit the ground running; u/swimming_legend said they are working on a new way to improve the design of the page and make it more user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important change that the team is working on, according to u/thejappster, is a way to consolidate all the posts about social groups — such as people who are looking for a group to hang out with in real life. That way people looking to make real friends or who are feeling lonely have a place to meet others in similar situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the team’s main focus has been around establishing a syllabus bank, which officially launched on Jan. 5, according to an </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ekf9et/syllabus_bank_new_for_winter_2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement on Reddit.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to u/thejappster, the bank is a resource where “users submit syllabi to an online database, like Google Drive and you post that link to the Reddit page.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current and forthcoming improvements to the Reddit page are not only for the benefit of the sub itself but also for the students’ lives, as they use the page as a resource for all things UCSB, Boe stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, having two current students as moderators will also help to better represent the current student perspective at UCSB, Boe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are the ones who have the opportunity and the time to put into making the community better.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [Jan. 17, 12:38 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Boe was the head moderator of r/UCSantaBarbara, that he maintained the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has three members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article has been corrected to reflect that r/UCSantaBarbara has no official head moderator, that Boe did not maintain the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has four members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quotation that contradicted Boe’s statement regarding the moderators’ ideas for the Reddit page has also been removed. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
