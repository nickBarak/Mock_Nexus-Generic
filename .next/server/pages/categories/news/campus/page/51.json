This year, the conglomerate of volunteers hopes to register 8,000 people by May 23, the California registration deadline.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a place of transition in people’s lives,” said Jacob Lebell, a UCSB alumnus who is registering voters. “They come here to learn, to find themselves, to let other things go and become the people that they’re going to leave as. One of the things we really hope they become going forward is voters engaged in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Lebell is on staff for Joan Hartmann’s third district supervisor campaign, but he stressed that the voter registration effort itself is completely nonpartisan and said they do not ask for whom someone plans to vote.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest priority and value — far beyond partisanship — is that people are able to access their rights if they want,” Lebell said. “A person’s vote goes much further here than it goes back home. This is going to benefit I.V. beyond them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70079\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70079\" data-attachment-id=\"70079\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/local-group-registers-more-than-2000-to-vote/voter-registration-april-18/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Voter Registration April 18\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70079\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Jacob Lebell explains the registration process to Kevin Surnip.

Even Lebell’s aunt stopped by to help register voters.</p>\n<p>Abboud said people are eager to register because of the excitement surrounding the presidential race, but that the goal of the registration is to increase turnout for the third district supervisor elections.</p>\n<p>“The main purpose of this voting registration drive is not the president at all, but it’s the county supervisor election,” Abboud said, adding that the third district is “a swing district and the students have a major say.”</p>\n<p>Elijah Ettenger, a UCSB alumnus, is working with the conglomerate as a voter register for the county’s Democratic Party. He said encouraging people, especially students, to vote by mail is important, but that simply letting voters know the primary election is during finals week is most vital.</p>\n<p>“The vote-by-mail is a component but really it’s about letting [people] know that [the primary is] Tuesday during finals week and letting them make that decision, asking them what works for them as far as getting to the polls,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College students, for example, will be out of school by the June 7 primary, meaning that many of them need to prepare to mail in their vote.</p>\n<p>The registration group is hoping that between 4,000 and 5,000 vote this year, nearly half of which they expect to vote by mail.</p>\n<p>After the June 7 primaries, many Isla Vistans will be changing their addresses, meaning that they will need to register again, likely under a different polling center.</p>\n<p>“Here, almost everyone moves every year,” Abboud said. “We start from zero on July 1, in our minds, and start again.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>Not sure if you’re registered? <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ucsbcanivote\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to check your

   <p>The University of California Student Association (UCSA) recognized a UCSB student and May 23, 2014, shooting survivor as Student Advocate of the Year on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Siavash Zohoori, a fourth-year economics and sociology double major, received the award for working toward improvements in sexual assault prevention and mental health services.</p>\n<p>Zohoori led the beginning stages of UCSA’s #HowAreYou campaign in early summer 2015, pushing forward a system-wide effort to reform student mental health services on UC campuses. He currently serves as the undergraduate representative on the UC’s Student Mental Health Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p>Although he was unable to attend the ceremony in Sacramento, Zohoori said UCSA’s award serves as validation for his work.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>“It’s so hard sometimes. It feels like you may not be going anywhere,” Zohoori said. “This gives me momentum and knowing that I’m going the right way.”</p>\n<div style=\"width: 3970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.vash.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/0T7A8119.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Kamran Zohoori</em></p></div>\n<p>After surviving the shooting in 2014, Zohoori began a “period of studying” to educate himself about gun violence. His research directed him to create the “Boys ‘n’ Guns” initiative, which aims to address the relationship between mental health, gun violence and societal pressures of masculinity.</p>\n<p>Zohoori also hosted several workshops on sexual assault and mental health at UCSA conferences throughout 2014 and 2015. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/\">In October 2015</a>, he spoke to UCSB’s Inter-Fraternity Council about a culture of sexual assault within universities.</p>\n<p>“I started to really learn to use my story to do something that I really love doing, and that’s to help people feel more connected,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>“He’s done exceptional things, both with his own program and with helping with a lot of statewide initiatives,” said Mohsin Mirza, Associated Students External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major.</p>\n<p>Prior to the creation of the #HowAreYou campaign, Mirza’s office asked Zohoori to participate in forming a statewide student mental health campaign, first known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-08-20/ucsa-to-focus-on-letstalk-mental-health-awareness-campaign/\">#LetsTalk</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were anticipating that it would be a big topic in the year to come, but even then we didn’t expect it to be what it became,” Mirza said. “He played a big part in that.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori released his video “Why Do Mass Shootings Happen?” in February, in which he speaks about his personal experiences during the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe

style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the video, he narrates riding his bike by the 7-Eleven in Isla Vista when he witnessed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/sheriff-releases-report-detailing-events-of-2014-i-v-mass-murder/\">Elliot Rodger</a> shoot two bikers in front of him. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/\">Zohoori hid in the 7-Eleven</a> until he could return home after the shooting had ended.</p>\n<p>“I had a dream that Elliot Rodger was chasing me while I was running along this chain-link fence, and I just woke up right before he got me,” Zohoori says in the video. “It was so fucking scary.”</p>\n<p>If students create a supportive and nurturing environment for each other, Zohoori says the consequences of hyper-masculinity can be avoided.</p>\n<p>“We’re all going through tough times in our life — we’re all going through shit,” Zohoori says in the video. “We need to show each other more support and compassion, just like we did back in May, because with communities like these we’d never feel the need to prove ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

UCSB, which has not been updated since 1995. Graduate students hope it will protect them from “abusing power.” <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) is proposing a revised graduate student Bill of Rights for the first time since 1995 to protect graduate students from abuse and exploitation.</p>\n<p>The GSA passed the newly drafted Bill of Rights in its General Assembly meeting on April 5. Representatives submitted the draft to the Academic Senate on Monday and hope to present before the Senate’s Graduate Council soon.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights currently in action at UCSB was drafted and ratified in 1995. The University of California Student Association (UCSA) drafted a system-wide graduate student Bill of Rights in 2011 and UCSB’s GSA informally approved it soon after.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Kathy Swift initiated the revised Bill of Rights in December and said she expanded upon UCSA’s 2011 Bill to make the new Bill. The 2011 Bill is about 20 pages long, and the recently passed draft is about 21 pages long.</p>\n<p>“I just basically beefed it up and expanded a couple parts that I thought were needing more support, more explanation,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>Swift said the new bill adds language allowing for the creation of a graduate student advocate position and a shared governance board. Her vision is that the graduate student advocate would be someone students could rely on to “negotiate through the bureaucracy” and resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>The shared governance board, Swift said, would be a group of student representatives, including the graduate student advocate, with voting power in the Academic Senate. Swift said members of the Academic Senate might be skeptical of allowing a shared governance board.</p>\n<p>“That’s a real touchy one,” Swift said. “That’s where we’re going to get into some negotiation.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the need for a revised Bill of Rights comes from the “touchy and more sensitive relationship” between graduate students and the university. She said academic departments typically consider graduate students as low‐level associates rather than colleagues.</p>\n<p>“We encounter situations where we’re exploited or we’re taken advantage of or we’re not respected,” Swift said. “That can really be destructive for our academic careers.”</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, GSA vice president of committees, helped Swift draft the bill and said advisers have strong influence over a graduate student’s professional life through letters of recommendation, networking and aid in publishing.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are “basically working under a group of like three to six people who have control over all of those things,” Irvine said. “So, if they decide to abuse their power, your ability to respond to that is extremely limited.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said the university currently has a process in place by which graduate students can respond to abuse, but he said these efforts are “akin to Band‐Aids on bullet holes.”</p>\n<p>“There is a method for adjudication, but it doesn’t necessarily work that well, and it doesn’t necessarily give people justice,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Yanira Rivas Pineda, the GSA external vice president, said having a graduate student Bill of Rights is necessary to help graduate students who are in dysfunctional relationships with their advisors.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students, we sacrifice our financial stability and basically put our life on hold for a few years,” Pineda said in an email. “The last thing we need is to have to navigate conflicts on our own with little to no support or guidance.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the 1995 Bill of Rights in action across the university, drafted in 1995, offers basic protections to graduate students, but is incomplete.</p>\n<p>“It is not comprehensive,” Swift said. “It doesn’t cover a lot of areas that graduate students need.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she needs to consult with the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division, otherwise the newly revised graduate student Bill of Rights will not be enforced.</p>\n<p>“[Graduate students] don’t have that much in the way of enforcement power at all, which is why it’s necessary for us to try to negotiate this with the Graduate Division and the Academic Senate,” Swift said. “They’re the ones that will make the enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Swift said representatives of the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division have already begun to express skepticism toward the new draft in her meetings with them.</p>\n<p>“This is going to cause problems,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 14,

Trump and disparaged immigrants and Muslims.</p>\n<p>“At various locations along the path where chalkings were more specific, we will stop in order to have a speaker from those communities address the crowd, and march participants will write positive messages on chalk walls,” the organizers said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The group had three demands in their November 2015 march at UCSB, which attracted more than 1,000 students. These demands were tuition-free public college and universities, cancellation of all student debt and a $15 per hour minimum wage for campus workers.</p>\n<p>This year, the group is also demanding divestment from private prisons.

classes to immerse themselves in creative alternatives.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind the hiatus is Laurel Beckman, professor of art, who says the event is intended to create a “communal environment” within the art department. Alaia/Paipo surfboard making, silk scarf dyeing and a trip to the Getty Center Museum in L.A. are among the activities planned this week to replace the regular humdrum of university life.</p>\n<p>Beckman said the idea for the interlude came together quickly because of cooperation from faculty and students. Students are “agents of their own interests,” Beckman said, explaining that they will be leading several of the week’s activities.</p>\n<p>“One of the really important parts of the interlude is that everybody’s participating: students, staff, faculty, grad students, undergrads, everybody,” Beckman said. “Other than classes and working by yourself in the studio, we don’t have a lot of community activities, and I wanted to do [an interlude] so people could choose … what they participated in.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69768\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69768\" data-attachment-id=\"69768\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/arts-building-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Arts Building\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kip Fulbeck, professor of art, said recently that students had not been producing with the same “drive and fervor” that he is used to, and the arts faculty had also become complacent.</p>\n<p>“We were becoming stagnant and needed to shake things up,” Fulbeck said in an email. “I’m hoping to re-ignite our creative drives, excitement, passion for making art and experiencing life. You learn more outside the classroom than in it.”</p>\n<p>Graduate students found out about the interlude late last quarter and were highly encouraged to direct activities or to create ideas for alternative classes.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Rose Briccetti, who has organized a butterfly pinning event, said the interlude will be an interesting outlet for creativity.</p>\n<p>“[The interlude] seemed like a fun kind of unique way to get people thinking about art outside the confines of just painting or printmaking or sculpture or the materials and ways of making we kind of generally adhere to,” Briccetti said.</p>\n<p>According to graduate student Emily Baker, the arts department is lacking a critical element of preparation for a career in arts: a tight-knit community. Baker said she pushes students to go to art events every quarter so they can talk about their work and have contacts to “bounce ideas off of.”</p>\n<p>“As an artist, networking is my work. It’s my job, you know? Like the whole ‘wine and cheese’ art event thing, that’s work,” Baker said. “And I did feel that lack of community in the arts department … so I think this will help perpetuate that community a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Students and professors alike are unsure at the moment whether they will carry the interlude into the future, but at least a few, like Briccetti, are very interested in seeing it continue as a department tradition. Taking a risk is difficult in huge institutions, Briccetti said, commenting that university rules and protocols can limit activities that are “strange and different and out of the box.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think you can have innovation, or you know, society can’t move forward if people aren’t willing to just try something new,” Briccetti said. “So I hope that this — regardless of how it all shakes out — is something that will inspire other departments and our department to shake things up, to try new things, to not get stuck in old ways of doing things.”</p><div

faculty hiring committees and has drafted a resolution to be included in the hiring process.</p>\n<p>When hiring new faculty members, academic departments first select candidates and send the final decision to a vote from the entire university faculty, including professors, assistant professors and lecturers.</p>\n<p>GSA’s resolution will ask that at least two graduate students be allowed as members of the hiring committee, with access to all necessary materials for making informed decisions. Graduate students of the department will democratically elect the two representatives, according to Yanira Rivas Pineda, graduate student and GSA’s Vice President of External Affairs.</p>\n<p>“We think that a minimum of two students should be included in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “To have only one student and the rest of the committee members be faculty might be intimidating for a student.”</p>\n<p>Pineda said graduate students work closely with faculty as their research assistants, teaching assistants and mentees and it is important for graduate students to understand the faculty hiring process.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69774\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69774\" data-attachment-id=\"69774\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/gsa-lounge-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"GSA Lounge\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69774\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69774\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It helps with our professional development because we get to learn first-hand what the hiring process looks like, how to craft competitive [curriculum vitaes], teaching statements, and what faculty are looking for in prospective applicants,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>By drafting the proposal, UCSB is joining a system-wide effort through the UC Student Association Graduate and Professional Committee.</p>\n<p>In August 2014, the Graduate and Professional Committee of UCSA adopted the Graduate Students Democratizing Education (GrADE) campaign. According to Pineda, UC Berkeley’s GSA drafted and passed a resolution in favor of GrADE and other UC graduate students hope to pass similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“The campaign … addressed problems with the lack of faculty diversity (in all forms), finding adequate mentorship and faculty with research projects that reflect the 21st century graduate population,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>Iman Sylvain, UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly Vice President of External Affairs, said she helped write a resolution that endorses the full and permanent participation of graduate students in faculty hiring processes with equal rights to interview and provide input as faculty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem.” — Timothy Irvine</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The UC acknowledges that it lags behind peer institutions in hiring women and underrepresented minorities,” Pineda said in an email. “We believe that having the next generation of faculty (those of us being trained to become professors) being part of the hiring process is [a] small but necessary step in democratizing the hiring process and our university.”</p>\n<p>According to Timothy Irvine, GSA’s Vice President of Committees and Planning and graduate student, a small percentage of tenured or tenured-track faculty are African American. He said having younger, more diverse people involved in hiring committees would play an important role in increasing diversity.</p>\n<p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem,” Irvine said. “Hiring committees are a big part of the solution to that problem.”</p>\n<p>Irvine also said having graduate students who are being taught by faculty on these committees would be a “very logical next step towards shared governance” between students and universities.</p>\n<p>Irvine said UCSB’s current system is “decentralized” and graduate student voices are heard differently in each department’s hiring process.</p>\n<p>“That is done in the name of academic freedom, but what you also get is like a patchwork of adherence to different conduct codes and legal codes,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Some GSA members expressed concern about the change creating too much pressure for graduate students who find themselves in disagreement with department faculty. Others questioned whether graduate students should have voting powers.</p>\n<p>“I believe that these concerns are precisely why we need to include graduate students in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “Those of us who are going to stay in the academy should be able to experience the hiring process from the other side and not just when we’re out in the job market.”</p>\n<p>GSA members are in the process of modifying their initial draft, and will bring the resolution to a vote during a General Assembly Meeting on May 3.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Timothy Irvine as saying “Human Rights Act” instead of “Civil Rights Act.” The article has been updated accordingly. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-69712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students created a large “Black Lives Matter” statement in front of HSSB earlier in April. <em>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p class=\"p3\">Chancellor Yang said the university would take the petition “very seriously,” adding that the town hall was not the end of the discussion.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“This is not the ending, this is just the beginning,” Yang said. “We will continue the dialogue, the discussion, the discourse and reaffirm our commitment to having a diverse campus community that fosters an inclusive, respectful and supportive environment.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Some students have already responded to the initial chalking, creating a large “Black Lives Matter” statement last week that encouraged UCSB to “practice empathy.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At least one</span><span class=\"s1\"> campus group is organizing its own reaction. A second “Million Student March” is planned for Thursday and organizers have chosen a theme of “reclaiming” UCSB from the anonymous chalk writers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The event description encourages students to join the march “in an effort to RECLAIM our campus after heinous, racist chalk statements targeted at many marginalized communities at UCSB.” The group says it will address “each specific chalk statement” with new “chalk walls.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>University News Editor Maura Fox contributed reporting</i></b></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting, making speeches to the senators concerning the Students for Justice in Palestine’s resolution for divestment. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am a person who believes that only economic prosperity for Palestinians will be able to pave the way towards peace,” Eid said. “The BDS movement, in my opinion, has no idea the harm they are causing to the Palestinians. If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters of BDS and members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) have criticized Eid’s stance. Audience members called him a “traitor” in February at the University of Chicago, and just days before his UCSB event, SJP and the Muslim Students Association at Cal State Long Beach protested his lecture there. At UCSB, campus security was present, but the event proceeded without incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, organized Eid’s lecture without the aid of any student organization by contacting the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), the agency overseeing his tour, after noticing Eid was speaking at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p> If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important for our community and students on either side, or on no side, of this issue to hear the truth, and Bassem is one of the biggest sources of truth on this issue because of his background as a Palestinian human rights activist,” Shenassa said. “The reality is that BDS is not conducive to peace whether it’s on campus or in the Middle East.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to denouncing BDS, Eid spoke on topics ranging from his arrest by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 1996 to the corruption of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid maintains that the only solution to the plight of Palestinians must be one that improves the economic standing of his people. He said over 92,000 Palestinian workers currently hold Israeli work permits and enter Israel to work for the companies BDS seeks to divest from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He pointed at the closure of a SodaStream factory that BDS successfully forced to move out of the West Bank as a disaster for 1,500 Palestinian workers who lost jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians living in the West Bank are not worried about settlements,” Eid said. “They are worried about having a job and how they will feed their families.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the plight of Gaza, Eid said he places most of the responsibility on Hamas, the ruling government there, which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization and Eid calls a “dictatorship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves.” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want BDS to come to the leaders of Hamas by asking why the leadership imposed three wars on the Gaza strip,” Eid said. “I think the survival of the Gazan people is the responsibility of the Hamas organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid gave individual messages for SJP members and BDS advocates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves,” Eid said. “To the BDS, I have to say you are killing our economy. You are destroying our economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives who attended the lecture declined to comment.</span></p>\n<p>When asked what BDS supporters can do to help the Palestinian people, Eid suggested investing rather than divesting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the BDS will succeed to persuade Palestinian billionaires who are living abroad to invest in Gaza and the West Bank, I will look at that as a huge help,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta resident Andriana Goodell said she came to learn from someone with “relevant experience” of the conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw it advertised in my community center and thought it was interesting that Eid lived for 33 years in Shuafat,” Goodell said. “I learned good information from a person with relevant experience toward the Palestinian and Israeli conflict.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eidan Shalom, a third-year psychology major, served in the Israeli Defense Forces from 2011 to 2013 and is the president and founder of Students Supporting Israel at UCSB. Although he disagreed with Eid’s call to open up Israel’s borders, he agreed with Eid’s views on BDS.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians need economic prosperity,” Shalom said. “When BDS thinks they are targeting Israel, in reality they are targeting Israeli businesses, which actually employ thousands of Palestinians.”</span></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: In an earlier version of this article, Mahmoud Abbas was referenced as the President of the State of Palestine.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of YouTube channel The Public</em></p></div>\n<p>Goodman has hosted “Democracy Now!” since 1996, and for most of that time it has run on KCSB-FM, the UCSB radio station that is presenting Goodman’s talk and book signing. Goodman’s book, <em>Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America</em>, written with contributors David Goodman and Denis Moynihan, will be released on April 12.</p>\n<p>“One of our first stops is Santa Barbara and a fundraiser for KCSB,” Goodman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I’ll be talking about independent media in a time of war and elections and how important it is to have the media, when we cover war, that’s not brought to you by these weapons manufacturers.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said her new book explores “the idea that it’s movements that make history,” rather than individual politicians.</p>\n<p>“Instead of hearing the same small circle of pundits, who know so little about so much, explaining the world to us and getting it so wrong, you hear people [on “Democracy Now!”] at the grassroots, closest to the story, telling their own stories,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>When the show began, “Democracy Now!” was broadcast on nine community radio stations. Twenty years later, the program is broadcast on more than 1,400 television and radio stations internationally.</p>\n<p>Goodman said she wanted to make college campuses a major part of her 100-city tour because universities and student activism are central to her show’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“We have a young, diverse audience and there’s so much happening on college campuses around the country, so it’s a critical part of what we do,” Goodman said, mentioning the Black Lives Matter movements last year at the University of Missouri, Ithaca College and more. “It is astounding how students’ voices are a key part of these movements.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">recent chalk markings around UCSB</a> supporting Donald Trump and disparaging immigrants and Muslims, Goodman called the slogans “extremely insulting.”</p>\n<p>“What Donald Trump has done is really open Pandora’s box with his hate-filled rhetoric; his islamophobic, sexist, racist language; his outright encouraging violence at his rallies,” Goodman said, adding that the students’ reaction was vital to maintaining a welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“I think students’ reaction—banding together and saying they won’t tolerate hate on campus—is a very important one and it’s a part of a whole coalescing of student activism,” Goodman said. “I think there’s a lot of energy on campus and a lot of commitment to making change, and that’s critical to the functioning of the democratic society.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus is named after a quotation attributed to educator Robert Maynard Hutchins: “A free press is the nexus of any democracy.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said Hutchins’ words are “absolutely” as true today as they were in 1970 when the <em>Nexus</em> was renamed.</p>\n<p>“I think independent media is the oxygen of a democracy, whether on campuses or off campuses,” Goodman said. “There is a reason why our profession — journalism — is the only one explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, because we’re supposed to be the check and balance.”</p>\n<p>Goodman will be speaking at Corwin Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. The event is free for students and $10 for non-students. Tickets can be purchased online at events.ucsb.edu or at the Associated Students Ticket Office.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily

“The Divided States of America” was featured at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and will be on display at both the 2016 Democratic and Republican National Conventions.</p>\n<p>Chor Boogie, artist of “The Divided States of America,” said the series opened his mind to a “whole different perspective” of politics.</p>\n<p>“Divided states of America, we’re supposed to be the United States Of America. I love my country, I love this country, I love other countries too, I love the world,“ Boogie said.</p>\n<p>According to Boogie, the series aims to uplift everyone, including those who are affluent and don’t experience many societal issues present today.<br>\n“I don’t see them tearing down, I see them lifting up and being uplifting,“Boogie said. “If somebody wants to take them that personal, that’s their personal prerogative. That’s my whole point of this entire series: solutions.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said he wants his art to provide viewers with new perspectives to prevalent issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69586\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69586\" data-attachment-id=\"69586\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/print-night-4-5-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bipartisan Art 4-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-69586\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“Of course, yeah, it opens up hearts, minds, bodies and souls to a whole new perspective that they either didn’t care about, or they do care about and they’re just so engulfed in the one way versus the 100 million other ways that are out there,” Boogie said. “Critical thinking, that’s all I ask for.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said the installment was in part a collaboration between him and Nirmal Mulye, the commissioner of the paintings.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, he gives some input but he puts in a good 20 percent vs. my 80 percent. The artwork is all my concepts,“ Boogie said. „He wanted a broader perspective of exposing the truth, exposing what’s really going on out there. He comes from a background of nothing, to basically starting his own businesses out here in America, and doing a lot of interesting things politically-wise.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said people are capable of finding solutions to the political, social, economic and religious divisions present in America.</p>\n<p>“I know we’re doing it, but [people are] using money and politics to push it in a certain direction versus ‘yo man, we need to do something about that or something drastically bad is going to happen,” Boogie said. “So that can go for a lot of these topics whether it’s immigration laws, education, religion … it’s endless bro”</p>\n<p>Boogie believes that should people throughout the world overcome their differences, solutions can be created and enacted.</p>\n<p>“Of course the world, ya know, I think everybody should be on the same page, but it’s not always gonna work like that. There’s so much diversity and different perspectives. If we can just create certain solutions that mold with that diversity, we should be good, ya know? Nothing’s gonna be perfect. Let’s just use some critical thinking with a little bit of precaution. Let’s be discerning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69604\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69604\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/","id":2525,"author":{"id":150,"name":"Noah Sayres"},"related":[2524,2523,2522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New UCPD Substation To Open in Library","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCPD is preparing to open a new substation in the UCSB Library, hoping to establish informal interactions between officers and students.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UC Santa Barbara Police are preparing to open a new substation in the UCSB Library, hoping to establish informal interactions between officers and students and increase their presence near the east side of campus.</p>\n<p>Chief Dustin Olson said he expects the substation, which is an office with a desk for two officers, to open shortly.

Much of UCPD’s focus is dedicated to the center of campus and the west side, which borders Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The substation “definitely extends ourselves to that east campus because we don’t have a large presence unless we’re mobile, driving in that area,” Olson said, adding that the new office is “a place where we can literally hang our hat.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, fourth-year biology major who was walking out of the library Monday afternoon, said she had mixed feelings about the new substation.<br>\n“I’ve been here late at night and I’ve seen CSOs walking around, but it’s not like a lot of security really,” Vest said. “I feel pretty secure in the library — everything’s closed at night and there’s only one door open — but maybe other people don’t.”</p>\n<p>While Vest said she thought the new substation was a “cool” idea, she said seeing police on campus makes her think someone has committed a crime.</p>\n<p>“I feel like in the past I’ve seen UCPD on campus and it kind of makes people feel uncomfortable,” Vest said. “If someone’s driving around in a UCPD car, I know that something’s going on on campus or something’s wrong.”</p>\n<p>That view is one that Olson hopes will change with the new station. He said officers should be “accessible to the community, a visible presence” and that the new substation will help officers interact casually with students.</p>\n<p>Nicholas O’Dea, first-year physics major, was studying on a bench outside of the library on Monday. He said “knowing that [the new substation] is there makes me feel a bit more comfortable, knowing that there’s a CSO presence.”</p>\n<p>O’Dea said he understood that others might not want UCPD officers to continually patrol the library, but that the office itself adds a level of security.</p>\n<p>“I might feel a little uncomfortable if they had been patrolling around the library, something of that nature,” O’Dea said. “But that fact that there’s a room there, I don’t feel uncomfortable with that. If something happens in the library, I know I can turn to them.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 3 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

graduated in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>To access the large, digitally active portion of UCSB’s alumni, the university is hosting “UCSB Give Day,” its first 24-hour online donation drive on Friday, to increase donor participation in student organizations, financial aid, scholarships and faculty research.</p>\n<p>“Give Day is a 24-hour event using social media channels to digitally connect to our UCSB communities,” said Beverly Colgate, associate vice-chancellor. “It is also a concentrated outreach to our campus’ massive base of young alumni.”</p>\n<p>According to Colgate, the university has raised “matching gifts” from donors to have their dollars match another donor’s area of passion, making fundraising more “personal.” If a donor contributes at a specific time, their donation can be matched with a campus organization of their choice.</p>\n<p>“Our giving website will post the time intervals when these matching gifts are available for matching,” Colgate said. “A couple of our Gaucho celebrities gave matching gifts, too.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB,” — Beverly Colgate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB First will also be tabling in front of the library on Friday to discuss the significance of philanthropy on campus. The organization will hand out T-shirts and offer photo opportunities for students to learn about the social media campaign.</p>\n<p>John Lofthus, UCSB Alumni Association associate director, said 60,000 students have graduated in the last ten years, and he hopes the young generation of alumni will digitally connect with the university, improving a nation-wide decline in percentage of alumni giving.</p>\n<p>“Young alumni are proven to be very philanthropic, but they’re wanting to invest through their philanthropy for causes they really believe in,” Lofthus said. “For us, because having alumni support is critical, it’s trying to think about how can we do a better job of connecting with our alumni. And this is one of those ways we’re hoping to do that.”</p>\n<p>An alumni group in London will be <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ucsb-gauchos-at-the-gaucho-tower-bridge-tickets-24303781264\" target=\"_blank\">hosting</a> their own Give Day at The Gaucho restaurant, showing how the event is reaching alumni “far and near,” Lofthus said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said the “community is really ready for this,” and explained that Give Day has already prompted alumni to show support for UCSB on their own social networking sites.</p>\n<p>“I cannot believe all the excitement I am seeing from our alumni, students and staff,” Colgate said in an email. “We have alumni who have volunteered to be “Digital Ambassadors” on Friday and proactively push the Give Day messaging through their social media channels.”</p>\n<p>Online fundraising is “immediate,” Colgate said, and allows donors to choose specific areas for support that they are most passionate about.</p>\n<p>“We have had an online giving site for many years, but this is the first UCSB Give Day where we focus on promoting online giving for 24 hours straight,” Colgate said in an email. “The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66219\" style=\"width: 5482px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img

by participating in Friday’s events.</p>\n<p>“UCSB First is leading the student engagement aspect of Give Day,” Frame said. “Our job is to get students excited about celebrating what an amazing feat it is that UCSB is hosting our first ever Give Day.”</p>\n<p>Frame said she hopes the online aspect of the fundraiser will create an easy way for alumni to access the university.</p>\n<p>“From a student perspective, I can predict that engaging online, whether that be via the official Give Day website, social media or word-of-mouth, will be an accessible way for students to get involved,” Frame said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said she is proud the university is using technology to support the campus in a joint effort with students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“Social media outreach is being used at many institutions, so we’re right in the middle of this wave,” Colgate said in an email. “This is a way to reach a constituency that is involved in non-traditional fundraising.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Give Day will begin on Friday at 12 a.m. Interested participants can access the website at <a href=\"https://giveday.ucsb.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://giveday.ucsb.edu</a>.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students paused Thursday as they walked by murals at North Hall depicting the Black Student Union takeover of the building in 1968. Rather than admiring the images, however, students were staring at the ground.</p>\n<p>“Trump build the wall 2016,” “Obama is a Muslim” and “Muhammad fucked children” were among the slogans etched in chalk throughout campus, concentrated around the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. On the sidewalk in front of the Asian Resource Center was the phrase, “Currency is devalued.”</p>\n<p>UCSB maintenance staff washed much of the chalk away by Thursday afternoon, leaving only blurred marks and puddles, but many students remained troubled by the aggressive messages.</p>\n<p>“Given the climate, given what [Donald] Trump’s name has come to mean — that it’s connected to white supremacist groups with racism — I think that was intentionally targeting [minority students],” said Zachary King, a sociology graduate student.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69230\" style=\"width:

third-year economics major and a member of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), said the messages were an “isolated event” and warned of making a spectacle of the slogans.</p>\n<p>“When these slogans and messages popped up, I wasn’t very concerned about who was saying these things because, at the end of the day, it’s just a handful of folks who were trying to be edgy or incendiary,” Hakim said. “I think giving it too much attention is giving them exactly what they want.”</p>\n<p>Chalking sidewalks is a violation of the UCSB posting <a

comment on the markings, but university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “because of the numerous posting violations that have occurred recently,” the Office of Student Life (OSL) will be sending an email to all students reminding them of the posting policy and letting them know where to report violations.</p>\n<p>Hakim said he was most worried about the marginalization of Muslim students on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69235\" style=\"width: 305px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69235\" data-attachment-id=\"69235\"
