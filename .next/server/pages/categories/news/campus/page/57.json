The holiday is only celebrated in a handful of locations including the United States, Canada, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico and Liberia.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> spoke to international students and those studying abroad at UCSB to see how their Thanksgiving experiences compared to the images they had of the holiday.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Alice Lomas is from Devon, England, and said she had an idealized image of Thanksgiving from American media.</p>\n<p>“I had seen [Thanksgiving] in all the American films, and I thought it was a massive family gathering with a turkey and a traditional Sunday roast experience, similar to what our Christmas is like,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>While Lomas said she cooked and spent the holiday with friends, she said it was lacking because family is what makes the tradition special.</p>\n<p>“It kind of lived up to the expectations, but because we didn’t have our own family there, it was not the same,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Cæcilie Køhler is from Copenhagen, Denmark, and said she understood Thanksgiving after watching television shows and movies portraying the American tradition, which she added is similar to a Danish Christmas.</p>\n<p>“It’s like this in Denmark during Christmas. Some people even eat so much that they have to go to the hospital,” Køhler said, laughing.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Xiaoyu Li from Beijing, China, compared his Thanksgiving experience in the U.S. to festivals in China because of Black Friday sales.</p>\n<p>“In China, there isn’t Thanksgiving, but there is a festival there that all the shops celebrate . . . It’s like a Black Friday sale,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Li said while he ate turkey and went Black Friday shopping during his first year at UCSB, this year he decided to spend it with friends making traditional Chinese food.</p>\n<p>“I went to Big Bear with a group of students and ate hot pot [an East Asian stew],” Li said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematical science major Omicron Wang from Chongqing, China, likened Thanksgiving to Spring Festival, known as Chinese New Year.</p>\n<p>“This is a time where every member of the family comes together,” Wang said. “We regard Thanksgiving in the U.S. as a regular holiday.”</p>\n<p>Second-year financial mathematics major Jennifer Sun from the Shandong province of China said although the food and traditions may be different, the values of the Chinese New Year and American Thanksgiving are similar.</p>\n<p>“When the Chinese New Year comes, we renew together and make traditional food like dumplings, just like people in the U.S. make traditional food and spend it with family,” Sun said.</p>\n<p>Second-year statistics major Shiwei Hua from Wuhan, China, said American Thanksgiving is similar to the Lunar Festival in China in some ways, but differs in others.</p>\n<p>“The Lunar Festival is when everywhere from the family gets together and eats traditional foods,” Hua said. “It’s a time for family to get together. I thought there would be many people in the street because during Lunar New Year we have games and puzzles all in the street.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of location or name, holidays provide an opportunity to celebrate one’s culture with the people, food and traditions that are important to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

held its first meeting to discuss social justice and civil rights at the Goleta Valley Conference Room last Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC is a national organization focusing on a three-pronged strategy to tackle racial and social injustice by fighting hate, teaching tolerance and finding justice. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB club will seek to meet these objectives through educational initiatives, advocacy and collaboration with existing groups which share similar concerns.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The club’s specific plans are to have police sensitivity training, create a coalition with other activist groups and host a “Know Your Rights” event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC Advisor and UCSB professor of classics Rose MacLean said the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goals of the club are to combat hate, promote positive change, and protect civil rights by focusing on the legal details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is essential that members of the community know their rights and have access to quality legal advice and representation,” MacLean said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club President third-year environmental studies and French double major Sebastianne Kent said the university needs clubs that fight hate groups, and that she encourages students to get involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “It doesn’t take your whole life and all of your time to do something that’s going to change peoples’ lives,” Kent said. “It just takes you deciding that’s what you want to do and finding other people who feel the same way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kent said she feels SPLC differs from other activist groups because it advocates for anyone treated poorly because of their race, gender, identity or religion instead of focusing on a specific demographic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are a lot of activist groups here that do amazing work, but SPLC has a history of advocating for everybody who is a victim of discrimination,” Kent said. “I think not only is that important, for everybody to feel like they have a safe space, but for them to feel like they have some kind of information about how to take action.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Secretary General and third-year sociology major Sanjukta Koppolu said she appreciates the club’s inclusive mentality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important because you have to realize that in an environment like a college campus, you are part of a community, so I think everyone is obligated to help each other out,” Koppolu said. “It shouldn’t be just women dealing with sexism or people of color dealing with racism. It should be everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Vice President and third-year English and psychology double major Caterina Lazzara, said she is interested in the club’s focus on legal rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to get involved here and make policy changes that would prevent these injustices from happening in the future,” Lazzara said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/","id":2597,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2596,2595,2594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B funded the festival $13,000.</p>\n<p>The American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME) requested $8,000 to install solar lights in Greek Park, part of a larger project to install solar lights throughout Isla Vista. The installation at Greek Park will serve as a prototype for the larger project.</p>\n<p>Third-year mechanical engineering major Matt DeVogelaere said the project is designed to combat the infrastructure deficiencies in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re requesting money to provide solar power in Isla Vista, hopefully starting with Greek Park,” DeVogelaere said. “Isla Vista has suffered from insufficient infrastructure advancements and we would love to have lights in our parks.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

(IRS) after filing IRS Form 990 for three consecutive years, having failed to do so for 12 years prior.</p>\n<p>IRS Form 990 is a tax form for tax-exempt organizations which outlines organization activities and finances. By law, the University of California is exempt from filing an IRS Form 990 because it is recognized as a government affiliated organization under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 115 and IRC 501(c)(3). The IRS is currently deciding whether Associated Students is exempt from filing IRS Form 990 based on its affiliation with the UC.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal said the current A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez addressed the IRS non-compliance issue by hiring lawyers to work with A.S. after she was hired in 2008.</p>\n<p>“From 2008 to 2012, that’s when we were in contact with lawyers,” Villarreal said. “Not just UC lawyers but we also brought in outside lawyers just to try to figure out where we were. We contacted the general counselor for the UC, so with their advice, we went to another lawyer who specializes in IRS matters.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) contacted her about the IRS non-compliance issue.</p>\n<p>“I had been working here in my office and UCOP called me up one day asking me why we haven’t been<strong> s</strong>ubmitting our own 990 document for the prior 12 years,” Marquez said. “I researched it and I found out the reason; prior to that there had been an understanding that turned out to be a misunderstanding.”</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, A.S. did not file the form for 12 years due to confusion about the relationship between the UCen and UC.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we weren’t filing before that was because at the time, we shared the same track ID number with the UCen because technically we are in UCen property,” Villarreal said. “Because the University files for the UCen, the UCen thought the [University was] filing for Associated Students. But they were not.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said it is difficult to categorize the tax status of A.S because it follows policies from UC Regents, A.S. Legal Code and regulations as a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“The mix-up occurred because we are both a department for the campus and system, and we also hold our own tax ID number,” Marquez said. “Students wanting to be independent from the university have maintained both levels of responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said A.S. is working with lawyers to research whether A.S. should be recognized as a UC-affiliated organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re not even sure if we have to file 990s and that is still something we’re still trying to figure out with our lawyers because we’re under a governmental entity which is the University of California,” Villarreal said. “So even now we’re still working on exactly figuring out if this is something we have to do.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said because A.S. has an unclear affiliation with the UC, he does not know whether A.S. will incur penalties from the IRS.</p>\n<p>“It is a possibility that there could be fines incurred, but I’m not really sure how much,” Villarreal said. “But we have the funds that we can use for that and we can take care of it if need be. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said the IRS compliance issues are mostly “small technical things” that must be fixed to maintain a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“IRS issues have been present in the Association for the past few years and it is an issue that the A.S Executive Director has been dealing with, informing the president and senate with updates,” Mariano said in an email.</p>\n<p>Mariano said it is unlikely the student body will be affected by the A.S.’s non-compliance with the IRS as long as A.S. continues to communicate with the IRS.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I believe that there isn’t much impact for the student body and student fees as long as the issue is being dealt with, which the Executive Director has been doing as mentioned before,” Mariano said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

his new book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doomed to Succeed: <em>The U.S.—Israel Relationship from Truman to Obama</em></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday at Campbell Hall, and spoke about relations between the United States and Israel from the administrations of former President Harry S. Truman through president Barack Obama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross has been involved with issues concerning the Middle East for more than 20 years, and his extensive experience gives him the ability to share a unique experience. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout his career, Ross has served as special assistant to President Barack Obama, special adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton, director of the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff in the George H.W. Bush administration and more. Ross helped form U.S. policy toward the former Soviet Union, played a prominent role in the unification of Germany and its integration into NATO, facilitated arms control negotiations, helped to form the 1991 Gulf War coalition and assisted Israelis and Palestinians in reaching the 1995 Interim Agreement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross engaged Friday’s audience through an interactive question and answer session where he would ask the audience questions and analyze their responses. After asking the audience which presidential administration had the most tumultuous relationship with Israel, Ross said it was former President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was “the toughest on Israel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross said there are three reasons why the United States sees Israel as “a problem and not a partner.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first assumption is that if we distance from Israel we will gain with the Arabs,” Ross said. “The second is that if we cooperate with Israel, we lose with the Arabs. The third is if we want to transform the American position in the Middle East, we need to solve the Palestinian issue first.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross then refuted each assumption using historical events as evidence. According to Ross, all three reasons are flawed, and the U.S. cannot distance itself from Israel because it is one of the few countries “we fundamentally share values with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross also shared his views on the Islamic State in Levant (ISIL), and the group’s recent act of terror in Paris that left more than a hundred dead. Ross referred to the terrorist group as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first thing we should be doing is asking how did this kind of attack take place?” Ross said. “Number two, what do we have to do to disrupt ISIS … to be geared towards thinking through how another operation is going to work through that. The third thing is we really do have to have a coherent strategy for Syria. Also finding a way to make Russia change its approach or, at a minimum, to go after ISIS.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year psychology and sociology double major Nina Abramson said she enjoyed hearing from a political figure that has been involved in Middle East diplomacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel that the public hears about ISIS and the President’s plans with Israel through media so it was cool to get a perspective from a diplomat and hear what the different presidents felt toward Israel,” Abramson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year psychology major Mia Feller said she liked that Ross asked the audience questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was a cool format of how he was asking people questions,” Feller said. “It kind of allowed for audience participation. I thought it was really good — a lot of information to grasp, but it was good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of religious studies Gil Ramot said he was impressed with Ambassador Ross’s “knowledge of detail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The intimate conversations and details that he knew about the administration really impressed me,” Ramot said. “His vast knowledge about what happened between specific people and people who were in some of the most secret rooms in the government impressed me.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/","id":2589,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2588,2587,2586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Transgender Day of Remembrance Commemorates Lives Lost to Violence","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Trans_Courtesy-of-Facebook-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Trans_Courtesy-of-Facebook-1.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"La Familia de Colores hosted their annual “Transgender Day of Remembrance” event on Friday to commemorate the group’s co-founder, former UCSB student and transgender Latina activist Zoraida Reye...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>La Familia de Colores hosted their annual “Transgender Day of Remembrance” event on Friday to commemorate the group’s co-founder, former UCSB student and transgender Latina activist Zoraida Reyes, and transgender individuals who have lost their lives in the past year.</p>\n<p>Reyes, who died as the victim of a hate crime in June of 2014, helped create La Familia de Colores to provide a safe space at UCSB  for Latin@s, people of color and their allies in the LGTBQ community. During the Day of Remembrance, an altar was dedicated to victims of deadly hate crimes and La Familia de Colores members read the names of all documented trans-identified persons killed since last year’s day of remembrance.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major and La Familia de Colores Organizer Abigail Salazar said Reyes was being honored for fighting for justice and equality in the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“We have a space that queer trans Latino folks can exist in within this very violent institution we are in,” Salazar said. “But we still honor all the other trans women and trans women of color who have passed away due to state violence or other forms of violence.”</p>\n<p>Salazar said she hopes people understand the “urgency” of the situation.</p>\n<p>“There’s no coincidence that there’s such a long list of … trans women of color murders,” Salazar said. “We have to be conscious of that and learn how to be allies in order to really help our trans brothers and sisters to create change.”</p>\n<p>According to La Familia de Colores member and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major Ernie Piña, there are dozens of transgender deaths that go unreported each year.</p>\n<p>“This past year, I worked in conjunction with organizing on behalf of Jesse Hernandez … while I continued and continued to look for research on Jesse Hernandez, there was nothing that was reported,” Piña said. “There’s all these trans folks that are passing, but they’re not shown or given the opportunity to visibility that other people would have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and global studies double major Kasey Rubio said the event should be more of a priority to the whole community.</p>\n<p>“Many women have been taken from us; I think everyone should be here to pay their respect,” Rubio said. “These are our fallen trans brothers and sisters. A lot of them we’ll never even know because most of them don’t get documented.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major and La Familia de Colores Board Member Emmanuel Suarez-Jimenez, society continues to struggle with the changing norms and perceptions surrounding sexual identities and lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“We live in a really transphobic society that really doesn’t know how to deal with new ideas, new concepts, new theories of how people want to live their way,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “I think that’s one thing we all need to really understand, is that we all have our own identities, we all pick them.”</p>\n<p>Piña said problems with sexual and gender identities persist because people cannot accept differences.</p>\n<p>“Our society in general doesn’t accept trans bodies because they’re deviant from the norm. In terms of trans bodies, in terms of what gender is — is just seen as abstract or weird,” Piña said. “That’s where hate comes from, that’s where a lot of what drives them from being is that people don’t understand.”</p>\n<p>Piña said many people do not comprehend the physical transitions of many transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Folks don’t understand — imagine living in this body or this existence where you don’t feel comfortable with the way you express your gender or you don’t feel comfortable in the way you are,” Piña said. “That’s what trans folks do; they make themselves so they can feel comfortable in their bodies.”</p>\n<p>Suarez-Jimenez said individual activists have been instrumental in challenging societal norms, such as Marsha P. Johnson who is credited for being one of the first people to incite the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York.</p>\n<p>“She’s a trans woman of color who threw the first stone, who started that police riot,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “She’s who finally started that momentum rolling on the fact that we really need to acknowledge that there are different identities and we need to accept them and we need to challenge ourselves to be more accepting.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said the Transgender Day of Remembrance provided an atmosphere to honor lost lives and focus on preventing future tragedies.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is just a beautiful space to grieve and to mourn, but also to reflect and look to the future and think about what we want to change and how we’re going to do that, so that we don’t have to continuously be holding these spaces for those that have been murdered,” Rubio said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66714\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66714\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/","id":2588,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2587,2586,2585],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mountain Climber Alex Honnold Summits Campbell Hall Stage","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Honnold-climbing-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Honnold-climbing-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Mountain climber Alex Honnold spoke on his recent book, Alone on the Wall, Sunday evening at Campbell Hall.

UCSB was named by the Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities in January as a Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) after reaching 25 percent Hispanic enrollment in undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Student Advocate General and fourth-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia, who is organizing the event along with Lorena Alvarez and Cassie Rubio, said the town hall will provide a space for students to voice their struggles and find ways to address them.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the town hall is to create a space where individuals who identify with the Latinx community can discuss issues that are pertinent to them,” Garcia said in an email. “Those issues can range from constant racial profiling, insufficient resources, displacement of Latinx families in I.V., etc.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said UCSB being an HSI does not necessarily mean Latino/a students are sufficiently represented on campus.</p>\n<p>“The number doesn’t show the retention percentage of the Latinx that are able to graduate,” Garcia said in an email. “It’s very rare to see a Latinx professor and graduate students on campus. This alone is one of the many reasons the town hall is essential. It is important to spark common conversation pertaining to how we want to be represented as a student body on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said Latino/a students face discrimination that surfaces in many ways which are not “isolated” from one another.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all individuals understand that the terror faced by the 43 students in Ayotzinapa about a year ago, the racist remarks made by presidential candidates, the criminalization of brown bodies, inaccessibility of higher education to undocumented students, the cultural appropriation of Latinx culture in Halloween … are all interconnected,” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year Chican@ studies major Mara Tinajero said safe spaces allow students to connect with their community.</p>\n<p>“Classes like Chicano studies, spaces like El Congreso and spaces for people of color is something our campus needs to pay more attention to and possibly get more funding [for],” Tinajero said. “Those spaces are crucial because our students go to those and feel at home.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said she thinks Latino/a students are represented better at UCSB than on most campuses, but there is still progress to be made.</p>\n<p>“I definitely feel that we have more representation on our campus than others because we are a Hispanic-serving institute,” Tinajero said. “I feel like our voices are heard louder than others, but I feel like it’s not enough. I feel like our voices need to be heard even more.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said her experience attending this year’s Students of Color Conference at UC Berkeley allowed her to connect and draw strength from others in her community.</p>\n<p>“It was really comforting to see that some of the struggles I’ve been through, I haven’t been through them alone,” Tinajero said. “Seeing how people took those experiences and push through and triumphed helps.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Cultivating Racial Consciousness &amp; Inclusivity” on Thursday, where panelists discussed racial tensions on university campuses across the country.</p>\n<p>Recent racially charged incidents — such as those at University of Missouri, Yale, UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Oklahoma and Harvard University – are raising the question of how UCSB staff and faculty can better serve as allies to students of color. Four panelists at the event, Lisa Slavid, Diane Fujino, Aaron Jones and Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, spoke about why U.S. campuses are experiencing racial tensions, how racial consciousness manifests itself on college campuses, how to speak on race in a classroom and freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>Professor of Asian American studies Diane Fujino said while the Civil Rights Movement eliminated formal discrimination, it was “insufficient” at combatting all race issues.</p>\n<p>“Racism has changed,” Fujino said. “The work in the ’50s was to legitimate that racism existed and it was wrong, but today, there is more knowledge that racism is wrong, and the work today is really to prove that it still exists.”</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Association President Aaron Jones said racism is still present in everyday society.</p>\n<p>“It is in all things,” Jones said. “If you’re a fish in water, you can’t see the water, doesn’t mean you’re not in the water. We’re living in it, we’re breathing in it. It’s in our society, so of course, it’s going to be manifested on a college campus.”</p>\n<p>Coordinator of organizational and performance management for Housing and Residential Services at UCSB Lisa Slavid said she is not surprised to see racial consciousness manifest on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“Really, where else in the country would they manifest?” Slavid asked. “Colleges are part of the institutions of the country, and these conversations need to happen. They won’t be happening in the companies or corporations of Google or Facebook or J.C. Penny, they will be emerging here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said college campuses should be safe, educational spaces for discussing racial issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re supposed to be able to engage in these kinds of dialogues. If we can’t have those types of dialogues and conversations in a university, then we’re in really bad shape,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said such conversations should not be limited to certain majors.</p>\n<p>“Even in Chicano studies, we feel like we need to talk about Black Lives Matter,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “We don’t think that this is something that should be in one department, in one discipline. We need to talk about Black Lives Matter in our own department, in our own community.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said people need to discuss their different views and opinions to begin a dialogue.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people have a problem with the name ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and that’s okay, but we need to talk about this,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “How are we going to work this through otherwise? It’s not easy to have a conversation about these things — it’s a very difficult thing to walk through, but I don’t think it was fair for people not to talk about it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66697\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251323568\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66709\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66697\" data-attachment-id=\"66697\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/regents-form-group-to-protect-students-from-intolerance/intolerance_by-vivian-bui-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447936053\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Consciousness/Calling In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66697 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Slavid said conversations about racial issues may be difficult because of fear.</p>\n<p>“There’s a silence, and it’s mostly because people are afraid,” Slavid said. “They’re afraid to say the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>Fujino said these conversations can be difficult to approach in a class setting, but faculty and staff must work to appropriately address the issues.</p>\n<p>“For professors, it’s trial and error and if we’re dedicated, we talk to colleagues to figure it out,” Fujino said. “There is increasing attention to issues of what they call ‘diversity,’ that means it’s built instructionally. The faculty need to create a space in classrooms so that people can speak, and I also think what it takes is to evaluate and listen to each other.”</p>\n<p>According to Slavid, faculty and staff can be allies at UCSB by trusting and listening to students’ perspectives.</p>\n<p>“As a white ally, recognize that people of color’s lived experiences are different than yours,” Slavid said. “Show up, listen to learn, but also know when to speak as an ally, even if it makes you nervous, because our silence on topics of racial injustice is part of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of LGBT Services in the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity Klint Jaramillo said he knows students with questions about racial issues want to have conversations.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can move forward and make spaces like this for faculty and staff so we can not only support each other, but support our students,” Jaramillo said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/","id":2587,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2586,2585,2584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"El Centro Hosts Second Annual Open House To Show its Role as a Safe Space on Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/El-Centro_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/El-Centro_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"El Centro held its second annual open house on Thursday to educate students on its role as a safe haven for organizations and people of color.

The event was hosted by Mesa Directiva, a conglomerate of all the organizations that meet in El Centro, including El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and Radio Xicana.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Lorena Alvarez said she did not feel at home on campus until she found El Centro, and was hopeful Thursday’s open house would help students find a secure place.</p>\n<p>“For me, El Centro is a home, and I want to provide an opportunity for students to find a home like I did because I know I was lost on campus last year, and without El Centro I probably would not have stayed at UCSB,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and math double-major Minal Habash said until she discovered El Centro, it was hard to find people who understood the difficulties of minority students at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“For minorities, it’s hard to find support with a lot of the problems that we face, but El Centro is a great place to come to be able to find other people who also feel unappreciated on this campus,” Habash said. “It was the first place on campus where I really felt safe.”</p>\n<p>Habash said El Centro does not have the same amenities as other buildings. Until recently, El Centro did not have lights outside the building, nor was it labeled on the campus map.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said El Centro has also had to deal with the adverse effects of being located next to the library, which has been under construction. Now that many of the construction fences, which had obstructed students’ view of the building, are gone, Mesa Directiva wanted to host an open house to show students that the building exists.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Ocil Yuleima Herrejón Rivera said El Centro has been facing obstacles ever since she was a freshman. She said many of the problems are due to the fact that El Centro is a student-run building, making it more difficult for the students to get simple necessities in the building like a hydration station, outdoor lights and computers.</p>\n<p>El Centro’s second floor is reserved for engineers, but students say engineers rarely use it because they have their own, separate building. Rivera and many students who use El Centro would like to use the second floor to increase the resources for students who need help.</p>\n<p>“In these years we’ve really tried to help El Centro grow, and part of that has been trying to have access to the second floor,” Rivera said. “It would only make sense for it to grow upward instead of to another building. Having access to the second floor would allow us to have more resources for different students of color on campus.”</p>\n<p>As El Centro strives to accomplish these goals, the students will continue to host an open house every year to grow the membership of the organizations that meet there.</p>\n<p>First-year math major Matt Uffenheimer attended the event and was glad to know the building’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wondered what the building was for. I had no idea it was a meeting place for so many organizations and people,” Uffenheimer said. “Even though I’m not a student of color, I’m glad I’m now aware of the importance of this building to the people who use it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/el-centro-hosts-second-annual-open-house-to-show-its-role-as-a-safe-space-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/el-centro-hosts-second-annual-open-house-to-show-its-role-as-a-safe-space-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/el-centro-hosts-second-annual-open-house-to-show-its-role-as-a-safe-space-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/el-centro-hosts-second-annual-open-house-to-show-its-role-as-a-safe-space-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/el-centro-hosts-second-annual-open-house-to-show-its-role-as-a-safe-space-on-campus/","id":2620,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2619,2618,2617],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Stigma Free UCSB’ Held To Promote Understanding of Mental Health Issues, On-Campus Resources","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  UCSB’s Active Minds chapter and the A.S.

Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) co-hosted an event titled “Stigma Free UCSB” at Storke Plaza Thursday to educate students about mental health issues and on-campus resources for students.</p>\n<p>From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., more than 12 organizations, including I.V. Food Co-op, C.A.P.S., RHA, C.A.R.E., A.S. Food Bank, Student Health and EDAS, tabled to educate students and encourage dialogue about mental health. Attendees participated in four activities including jumping on a sheet of bubble wrap covered with stigmatizing comments called “Stomp Out Stigma” and filling a sandbox with sand representing different illnesses. Participants could also write encouraging comments on a wall called “Stigma Free Wall” and on a mirror called the “Body Positive Mirror” while listening to a live music performance by UCSB alumnus Erisy Watt.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Active Minds Co-President Melissa Boomer said her favorite event was the Stigma Free Sandbox.</p>\n<p>“The Stigma Free sandbox … is where we have five different colors of sand, each corresponds to a different phrase regarding stigma and mental health, like, ‘I support those with mental illness,’ or, ‘I suffer from mental illness,’ and stuff like that,” Boomer said. “They make a little plastic container filled with the colorful sands, and they decorate it with seashells so they have a little memento to take home today.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting double-major and COSWB co-chair Kim Liao said COSWB got involved with the event to increase their focus on students’ mental well-being.</p>\n<p>“We realize that mental health is an issue for many students here, and there’s a stigma to talk about it, to reach out,” Liao said. “So I think it’s really great that we get to participate in this and co-sponsor this event and spread more awareness for mental health.”</p>\n<p>Liao said COSWB created a board of Polaroid photos from the event, showcasing students holding pre-made signs to be displayed in Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“We put Polaroid pictures up of people holding a sign that says … ‘I’m not defined by my insecurities,’ or, ‘I don’t live in my body image issues,’ things like that. There’s no stigma to put it out there and to tell everybody else that you’re not alone,” Liao said. “Some people just put really nice quotes in there that brightens peoples’ days, like, ‘You’re beautiful,’ and, ‘You’re loved.’ I think it’s a really sweet thing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66667\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"134320978\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66684\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66667\" data-attachment-id=\"66667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/minds_-by-alex-payne-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447893851\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Active Minds Stigma Free\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Alex Payne/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to second-year psychology major Marisa Jones, one in four Americans will struggle with a mental health issue within a year, and one in two will within their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people who don’t take anxiety seriously, [they often say] ‘Oh, depression is just in your head,’ [they] treat it as something that you can just snap your fingers and fix and say ‘Just smile and your depression will go away,’” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said while she was speaking to attendees about kids struggling with depression, someone began to say the phrase, “if I had a normal kid…”</p>\n<p>“That just broke my heart, because there are children out there who do have mental illnesses, and so that’s a kid starting at 10 years old being told that they’re not normal,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said she hopes Stigma Free UCSB will help resolve mental health issues on campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so many thousands of people on campus, and we’re trying to make sure that we can get more stigma fighters one by one and that this is a big issue and that we need to fight the stigma,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina north tower Co-President and first-year undeclared major Tom Steel said RHA tabled to teach students living in residence halls about finding help on campus and to show them they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“We are [telling] them the safe spots around campus, different ways to get involved,” Steel said. “Different resources if you or if anybody you know is having any struggles.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and C.A.P.S. Mental Health Specialist Gladys Koscak said the most important takeaway for attendees is recognizing how prevalent mental health issues are in society.</p>\n<p>“It’s usually not until someone has a personal experience with someone who’s had depression or anxiety that people start to really understand what the impact of that can really be on people,” Koscak said. “People can be very high-functioning and still be struggling in silence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and singer Erisy Watt said she enjoys performing at events where people unite to support each other.</p>\n<p>“Everybody who’s here really highlights the wonderful things about Isla Vista and our community, and I think that’s what this area in particular needs. It’s a strong community to just support each other and help each other and make it a more beautiful and happy place,” Watt said. “I’m happy to be able to provide sound, music for such a great community gathering.”</p>\n<p>Watt said she performed Jack Johnson and Paul Simon songs, but most of what she played were original compositions.</p>\n<p>Watt said one of her favorite lyrics from her original piece “Thailand Story” is “the wildness of the earth is the wildness in me.”</p>\n<p>“I really liked playing that song because I like to spread that message that there’s the wildness that we see, there’s the forest and the ocean that are these vast things in nature on the planet. We come from the same place, so it’s fun to recognize that in ourselves,” Watt said. “Sometimes we get so ‘Oh, I have a job’ and this and that, but I like to remind myself that I’m very much a part of this wild, crazy planet that we live on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66684\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66684\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/","id":2619,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2618,2617,2616],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to finalize reforms to the Elections Code and wrap up the first quarter of the 2015-2016 school year.</p>\n<p>Members from several A.S. boards and commissions reported their end of quarter progress for the 2015-2016 school year.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Redefine Political Parties within ASUCSB,” which outlines the plan to regulate student misconduct within political parties through the A.S Judicial Council instead of being self-regulated.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik presented “Resolution Denouncing S.A.G.E. [Student Advocacy, Governance and Engagement] without Referendum,” which would allow students to vote on UCSA fees through a system-wide referendum or to be able to opt out completely.</p>\n<p>“The end result for this would be a system-wide referendum where every school would be voting on the student fees that will be going to UCSA,” Abdalmalik said. “That way, UCSB students won’t be paying $10 while, say, UC Merced students pay $1.30 while getting the same exact benefits and same exact representation on the UCSA board.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said although he supports S.A.G.E.’s intentions to standardize UCSA fees for all UC campuses, he does not support mandating the fees because it takes away student’s voices.</p>\n<p>“I believe that S.A.G.E. means well. However the fact that it takes away students’ rights and autonomy to actually vote on the student fees that they will be implemented on is wrong,” Abdalmalik said. “[The bill] denounces the fact that it doesn’t include referendum as its means of collecting the funding.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza presented “A Resolution for Andres Sanchez Investigation,” which demands for a more thorough investigation of Andres Sanchez’s death on Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>“It’s been past a month where an investigation has not been conducted,” Melgoza said. “The family still have many, many questions on what happened to Andres. No one knows.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, witnesses and family collectively drafted a set of 50 questions they demand Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office answer. Melgoza said she is not satisfied with how IVFP and Community Resource Deputy (CRD) James McKarrell communicated with first responders and others involved with the incident.</p>\n<p>“We had a meeting with our Community Resources Deputy. If you were involved in the hiring of the CRD, his position was made for students and to involve the relationship of IVFP and us students,” Melgoza said. “When I, as a first responder, along with my housemates went to him for help, that help was not available. This was because one, his role was not set up, and two, he was just unable to answer our questions.”</p>\n<p>Student witness Jocelin Hernandez said rather than placing blame, the bill is intended to bring closure to the family and community.</p>\n<p>“We are not working for blaming. We are working for changing,” Hernandez said. “In terms of students and this university, we need to accept our privileges and that we can use these as tools.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said after seeing findings of a recent coroner’s report, witnesses still have questions about the circumstances leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“After a month of waiting for the Board of County, it looks like a toxicology report. It doesn’t matter how many drugs he might’ve been on because he was still a life that deserves to be treated to our ability,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>A motion to create a working group to reform election codes in order to regulate political parties year round passed.</p>\n<p>The reformed elections code passed in a hand vote, 12 to 3 to 4.</p>\n<p>“A Resolution in Support of Open Source Textbooks,” “Resolution Denouncing S.A.G.E. without Referendum” and “A Resolution for Andres Sanchez Investigation” also passed in a hand vote.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Amend the By-Laws of the A.S. Queer Commission” was sent to Campus Affairs and “A Resolution to Establish an Ad-Hoc Committee o8n on the Establishment and Integration of the A.S. Commission on Academics and Research” was tabled until the first week of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This story originally quoted Senator Melgoza as saying “The family still have many, many questions on what happened to Andres. No one knows. I have yet to know what happened to him the four hours before his friends saw him between 12 a.m. and 2 p.m.” The last portion of this quote has been removed as it is factually inaccurate to what occurred the night of Sanchez’s death.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

the group’s marginalization. <em>Courtesy of Facebook</em></p></div>\n<p>La Familia de Colores will host a “Transgender Day of Remembrance” on Friday in honor of Zoraida Reyes, a trans Latina activist and UC Santa Barbara student who was murdered in 2014.</p>\n<p>Reyes was a co-founder of La Familia de Colores at UCSB, an organization that seeks to provide a safe space for LGTBQ Latin@/Chican@ and people of color. While Reyes was unable to attain her degree in Chican@ Studies due to financial reasons, the graduating Class of 2015 presented it to her posthumously. Friday’s event was planned to honor those who identify as trans and have been victims of violence of hate crimes, as well as those who have fought for justice and equality for the transgender community.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity David Whitman said violence towards the trans community is a symptom of the group’s marginalization in daily life.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully the trans day of remembrance at UCSB can humble students to realize that oftentimes, by just being who you are, you are at risk for losing your life,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the event will honor the memory of individuals who have fought against oppression.</p>\n<p>“For us to do this, it is to show that yes, number one, they matter, and number two, this is an injustice,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>According to Whitman, events like the one taking place Friday are infrequent either because they are not widely publicized in the media or individuals are unaware of the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“This is something to care about, that this is an issue in our country, in our world, and hopefully [attendees] would at least be considering more, how they can be thoughtful, helpful, supportive and more loving,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said it is important to honor Zoraida because of her role in helping found La Familia de Colores, the only LGBTQ Chican@ organization on campus.</p>\n<p>“She created this space for people that identify in this intersection and they are feeling rightfully that it is their duty to always honor not just the founder of their group that continues to be a supportive place for Queer Chican@, trans-identified people, but also to highlight the broader issue of violence happening to trans people of color,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Adriana Pedroza said she was inspired to advocate for marginalized groups when she attended the Trans Revolution talk featuring trans-activist Jennicet Gutierrez in November.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t know about the transgender community and [that] having a day to support them allows the UCSB community to stand in solidarity and honor those who have been oppressed just for being themselves,” Pedroza said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said there needs to be more leaders in the UCSB community to spread awareness about the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“I think the people who don’t talk about this group are not educated or are unaware of the struggles transgender people face, so attending this event on Friday to learn more about the transgender community is a way of showing that you care,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Juan Villalobos said honoring those affected by transgender violence validates their struggle.</p>\n<p>“People still have the mentality that it’s a choice if you identify within a LGBTQ group, and it’s kind of sad that others aren’t aware of the discrimination they deal with,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-66584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov discussed his experience leading the pro-democracy movement against Russian president Vladimir Putin in a lecture titled “Winter is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped” in Campbell Hall Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>Garry Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union in 1963 and rose to international fame at the age of 22 when he became the youngest world chess champion in 1985. He grew increasingly politically active in 2005 and in 2008 ran against Putin in the Russian Presidential race. Kasparov shared about his experience as a political activist and why he thinks Putin is a global threat.</p>\n<p>Kasparov said when he began winning chess games, he realized he had a sense of responsibility to his country as a champion to address the political changes in Russia.</p>\n<p>“Winning the championship, I had some kind of responsibility,” Kasparov said. “I had to demonstrate to people that when Kasparov won, there was going to be change.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he does not know what the future holds for the power struggles between Putin and the free world, but Putin will be focused on remaining in power as democracies attempt to compromise with him.</p>\n<p>“Putin thinks about survival,” Kasparov said. “The free world is searching so desperately for common ground, democracies are slow to respond and they need strategy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world. He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.<br>\n<em>– Garry Kasparov</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kasparov said he was disappointed with how President George H.W. Bush and President Obama intervened in Russian politics and said Putin has benefited from their “inadequate approaches.”</p>\n<p>“Bush did too much, Obama has done nothing,” Kasparov said. “They always believe the Soviet Union after the Cold War could have been better. [Putin] could benefit from that general belief of working together.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he believes Putin is uninterested in finding common ground with the free world because he knows he will be unable to compete with it.</p>\n<p>“[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world,” Kasparov said. “He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he rejects the idea that Putin’s strategy is like a game of chess. According to Kasparov, chess is a game of rules and Putin does not abide by rules.</p>\n<p>“Putin is not playing chess because it’s a transparent game,” Kasparov said. “He plays a different game because he can win by bluffing. He can win by bluffing and blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said Putin can be “defeated” when Russian citizens believe he is no longer powerful.</p>\n<p>“Putin must demonstrate that he is no longer invincible,” Kasparov said. “The system must look weak in the eyes of his subjects. It’s all about political will that is so far not here. Putin is indispensible because everyone thinks he’s indispensable.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said about “30 percent” of his life is now dedicated to chess, and he enjoys it because it possesses the rules that politics lack.</p>\n<p>“It helps keep my brain in good shape,” Kasparov said. “Chess has rules. I feel more confident when I play by the rules.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Audrey Dalton said the most notable topic from the lecture was the idea that “dictators need enemies.”</p>\n<p>“I feel that sums up a lot of what [Kasparov] said. That’s why Putin is going to keep persecuting and starting wars in other places because he needs to justify his existence,” Dalton said. “Kasparov clearly has an informed opinion.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Diana Hernandez said she was interested in learning more about Putin to understand Kasparov’s actions.</p>\n<p>“I had a basic overview, but I don’t know that much about it, so that’s why I wanted to come,” Hernandez said. “I want to know the details of Kasparov’s decision, what he stands for and why is he against Putin.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year German and economics double-major Michael Göpper said he is interested in Russian politics because of Germany’s geographical proximity to Russia.</p>\n<p>“About the topic of Russian politics, I think I know quite a lot from reading German newspaper, because Russia’s not too far away from Germany or Europe in general,” Göpper said. “I’m really interested in Russian politics and Russian foreign relations and the issues that are involved in that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print
