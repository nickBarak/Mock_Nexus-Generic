Amputation is a fairly common event in response to meningococcal infections.”</p>\n<p>Shane Yen, second-year pre-biology major and one of many students waiting in line to get a vaccination last Friday at the Health Center, said he was looking forward to receiving the vaccination.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t look forward to getting shots,” Yen said. “But when you’ve got a deadly infection like meningitis, which could potentially kill you, I’m actually really eager to get this shot. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson provided tips for students to stay safe and prevent catching the disease and encouraged students to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“The most important way to prevent this infection is to get the vaccine — that’s number one,” Robinson said. “Other than that, avoid people who are sick, try not to share secretions and be aware in overcrowded situations.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson said the disease is contracted in social settings, which makes it especially important for college students to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“In times when there are outbreaks, visiting bars, drinking alcohol and smoking are also risk factors for catching it,” Robinson said. “But by far, the most important thing is to get the vaccine.”</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robinson, the vaccine’s most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Others can include fever, headaches and rare muscle aches, but these conditions are “a whole lot better than losing your life.”</p>\n<p>“The saddest thing as an infectious disease specialist is to see a young, intelligent, perfectly healthy student die or become maimed from this infection, when I know that it is preventable with a simple shot,” Dr. Robinson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68465\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68465\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/","id":2536,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2535,2534,2533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dance Marathon Raises Money for Children’s Hosptial","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students participated in a full 12 hours of dancing, games and activities to raise money for Cottage Children's Hospital in UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon on Saturday from noon to midnight in Ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68504\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68504\" data-attachment-id=\"68504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/dance-marathon-attendees-are-guided-in-a-stretch-by-the-emcees/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68504\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Dance marathon attendees are guided in a stretch by the emcees.

Although they organize fundraisers year-round, the 12-hour Dance Marathon event is the organization’s largest and most well-known event. The annual fundraiser invites UCSB students to perform and seeks donations from participants and the community. This year’s event raised approximately $16,000, which was substantially less than last year’s total of $35,000.</p>\n<p>Sueleme Ceballos, Dance Marathon Director of Entertainment and fourth-year political science major, said the organization originally hoped this year’s event would exceed last year’s donations.</p>\n<p>“The goal this time was $50,000 — we were hoping that it got there,” Ceballos said. “We were hoping to get it up there, hopefully higher every year. We want to set a good precedent for our future Dance Marathons, because the event is still new to UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Despite not reaching its monetary goal, Dance Marathon maintained a positive outlook, Executive Director and fourth-year biology Lynn Padlipsky said.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely thrilled about how the morale stayed positive the entire time. Everyone danced the entire time, everyone was happy,” Padlipsky said. “Do I wish the numbers were higher? Yes. But that’s okay. The morale was high this year.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68466\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68466\" data-attachment-id=\"68466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/the-amount-raised/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68466\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=800%2C530\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Sammy Gerraty Dance Marathon Intern of Operations and second-year dance and pre-bio double major, the spirit of the donors and volunteers made the event a success.</p>\n<p>“Even though we didn’t have as many dancers as last year and even though the numerical amount may not have been as much, the spirit in the room and the genuine care for the kids is what made people stay,” Gerraty said. “Last year people were coming to [get] volunteer hours, and that’s the wrong reason to come.

Daily Nexus won six awards from the California College Media Assocation on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <i>Daily Nexus</i> won six awards from the California College Media Association on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The <i>Nexus</i> placed first in five categories for weekly newspapers — best website, best headline portfolio, best photo series, best editorial and best breaking news story — and also placed third in best news photograph.</p>\n<p>Emile Nelson, the paper’s editor in chief, said in a statement that he “couldn’t be happier with the results of this year’s CCMAs.”</p>\n<p>Even better than the awards “is knowing that each and every one was earned through the dedication and passion of the students here at the <i>Nexus,</i>” Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“That’s what makes us a nationally ranked newspaper and that’s what’s going to keep us serving this community in the best way we possibly can — the passion, honesty and ability of the students at the <i>Nexus</i>.”</p>\n<p>The judges wrote that <i>DailyNexus.com</i> “excelled with a clean and well-organized home page, strong navigation tools and a wide variety of content,” adding, “An easy-to-use search tool helps find stories as far back as 2000.”</p>\n<p><i>Nexus </i>Copy Chief Simone Dupuy won best headline portfolio for what judges wrote was a good mix of “inventive and informative heads.” The headlines included “<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">Waive Goodbye to Your Financial Aid</a>” and “<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/deltopia-2015-boots-on-the-ground-but-its-still-going-down/\" target=\"_blank\">Deltopia 2015: Boots on the Ground, But It’s Still Going

Open People’s Party (OPP), which accomplished a near-sweep in last year’s elections, will not be participating, and many of its old members now identify with the new groups.</p>\n<p>In October, A Bill to Change Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferrable Vote (STV) passed and will be implemented this spring. Under STV, each voter will rank the candidates to their preference and will have a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate. As the votes continue to be counted and candidates are either elected or eliminated, the vote is transferred to other candidates according to the voter’s stated preferences in proportion to any surplus votes. The reallocation of votes may vary.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nemeh, author of the legislation and second-year history of public policy and global studies double major, said the new system will create more proportional representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The single transferrable vote was a new voting system we passed in the fall to increase proportional representation,” Nemeh said. “The idea behind STV and proportional representation is that on the ballot, voters can rank their candidates, and there’s a mathematical formula that takes all your choices into consideration. So if you’re a party that wins 60 percent of the vote, you’ll win 60 percent of representation.”</p>\n<h3>CAMPUS UNITED</h3>\n<p>Campus United, in its introductory letter to the student body, said students “are its priority.” They recognized the achievements of their party members, saying “although we are a new party, we take pride in the past accomplishments of our party leadership,” and are “eager to accomplish more on [the students’] behalf.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Collegiate Senator, Campus United member and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said Campus United is focused on bringing attention to student fees and general student services because UCSB students pay the most in student fees amongst all 10 UCs.</p>\n<p>“Our party is focused on getting some of the conversations and things A.S. does refocused on student fees and general student services. Our party wants to focus on student fees and their proper use and management because we have the highest student fees out of any UC by a longshot,” Minoiefar said.<br>\nMinoiefar said Campus United is focused on moving forward based on reforms to the old structure of OPP.</p>\n<p>“The new party implemented a lot of changes I wanted to see in OPP, mostly internal and structural changes; nothing grandiose. We wanted to start something new and give everyone some breathing space,” Minoiefar said. “I didn’t leave [OPP] because all these things were wrong, I just realized that I’d rather to start something new. My concerns weren’t what OPP had done in the past, but what I could do in the future.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68390\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68390\" data-attachment-id=\"68390\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/parties_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parties_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68390\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Campus United members Austin Hechler and Ashcon Minoiefar both left OPP to join the party as a way to take the old party’s ideas and evolve them into something more.

Publications for course readers.</p>\n<p>“We value inclusivity; we believe that everyone has a spot. We want everyone to know more about A.S. and to feel like they can get involved. We work for all the students, so we want to make sure everyone feels welcome to the services and resources we provide,” Hechler said. “What we want to see changed is representation of Isla Vista as a community service district, the new fee initiative, utilization of the A.S. website that just launched and tagging different parts of campus that use student fees that are A.S.”</p>\n<p>Hechler ran as a senator with OPP last year and said that he left OPP to work alongside students with a more similar set of goals, but supports the creation of many new parties. He also said Campus United has learned from OPP and will be using the aspects OPP members thought were successful.</p>\n<p>“I left OPP because I found a group of like-minded people that also didn’t agree with certain things OPP did. It’s not any hard feelings, I feel like it’s just better to have more parties to come in and not just have one mega party that everyone knows. I think it’s awesome that so many new parties have formed,” Hechler said. “We’re not OPP anymore, I feel like we’ve learned from OPP and [are] using the aspects we thought were successful in our campaign.”</p>\n<p>Campus United party member and fourth-year anthropology and global studies double major Sarah Tagger said Campus United values the students’ voices, the representation of students in A.S. and the fulfillment of student visions.</p>\n<p>“Campus United values the amplification of the student voice and the fulfillment of student visions. We aspire to focus on clear consensus student issues, increase services, provide safety, and improve academic accessibility,” Tagger said in an email. “We believe that every student should be represented within Associated Students and utilize its resources. We are dedicated to transparency and open channels of communication.”</p>\n<p>Tagger also said Campus United was formed because party members were “dissatisfied with the status quo” and provides a new perspective and leadership for students that pledges to provide students with essential needs.</p>\n<p>“Campus United offers an entirely new perspective and new leadership that pledges to provide students with the essential needs that we have been collectively advocating for,” Tagger said. “We are a fresh, new party with a vision for a bright future.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about Campus United, visit ucsbcampusunited.com and facebook.com/UCSBCampusUnited or attend any of the informational sessions on Feb. 18 at Santa Barbara Hillel (781 Embarcadero del Norte) at 7p.m., Feb. 22 San Nicolas Classroom at 7p.m., or Feb. 23 at Santa Catalina Fiesta Room at 8p.m.</p>\n<h3>PEER ACTION COALITION</h3>\n<p>Peer Action Coalition (PAC) outlined its platform in its letter to the student body.

When you look at the party’s original core values of trying to represent all students and students to all have representation and non-toxic spaces where all students are able to have constructive dialogue, it veered away from that and it wasn’t really the centrist party it used to be,” Larrazolo said. “When you have a political party that runs for 10 years, it’s hard not to become a political machine.”</p>\n<p>According to Larrazolo, PAC is the center-left party and hopes to promote inclusion and safe spaces on UCSB’s campus. Larrazolo also said PAC wishes to focus on academics and to reinstate the Academic Affairs Board A.S. dissolved last year.</p>\n<p>“Academia is a big priority to us. The Academic Affairs Board was dissolved by A.S. last year, and that was very concerning as the CCS Senator because my job is to focus on academics,” Larrazolo said. “I think we’ve focused on that more than other parties.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said PAC sees toxicity in previous A.S. elections and hopes to work collaboratively with the other parties to make sure elections are more transparent this year.</p>\n<p>“We want to reach out to the other parties to make sure that everyone is a student leader; a student first, leader second, and taking care of their mental health and treating themselves because nobody wants to come out of this being personally hurt or victimized because of personal agendas,” Larrozolo said.</p>\n<p>PAC member and third-year political science major Victor Garcia said PAC sees itself as a “hybrid” between Campus United and The Response, as they understand the need for activism and safe spaces on campus, but they also hope to represent the student population as a whole.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, we’re here to serve the students. We’re not here to serve ourselves. Regardless of what we think is necessary or right, we need to give in to what the students want,” Garcia said. “Ultimately, we want students to know that we want to represent them. Even if they don’t think A.S. is a space for them, we want them to feel comfortable enough to come to us and express their ideas.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about Peer Action Coalition, visit twitter.com/UCSBPAC and facebook.com/UCSBPAC.</p>\n<h3>THE RESPONSE</h3>\n<p>The Response prides itself on being a progressive party and a “response” to students’ concerns.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator, The Response member and second-year Asian-American studies and political science double major Akshaya Natarajan said The Response was formed because of frustration with the lack of representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our members are from different parties and wanted to create a change and bring in more communities,” Natarajan said. “Our platform is centered around that, a lot of community building.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan also said tuition-free and debt-free education and student well-being are central to their platform.</p>\n<p>“Our party also believes a lot in the right of education. One part of our platform that I don’t see in other platforms is the right to a tuition-free and debt-free education for all of our students,” Natarajan said. “Our party is also dedicated to the physical and mental well-being of the students.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan also said that The Response views itself as the most progressive party.</p>\n<p>“The other two parties don’t necessary pride themselves on being very socially progressive, but The Response stands wholeheartedly behind it,” Natarajan said. “We won’t back down even if there is backlash. We truly believe in progressive ideals and believe they benefit students and all types of different students.”<br>\nPAC member and second-year history of public policy and global studies double major Nawar Nemeh said The Response challenges engrained A.S. politics.</p>\n<p>“Historically in A.S., there have been two parties that dominate the space and grapple for power, and The Response sees itself as a new alternative to the system,” Nemeh said. “We think of ourselves as representing the everyday student, representing the underrepresented students who have been marginalized and completely cut out of A.S. and have no voice.”</p>\n<p>On-campus senator, The Response member and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major Alejandra Melgoza said The Response’s platform is still evolving.</p>\n<p>“Our party’s platform is still being added to because we want to hear everyone’s input and we haven’t recruited enough people to get a proper proportion of the student body,” Melgoza said. “A lot of our members have worked in the past with mental health reforms, sexual assault policies and advocating for more resources for students, especially low-income students.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, The Response also wants to increase representation for underrepresented communities at UCSB and bring the party members’ identities to light.</p>\n<p>“We created a new party because a lot of the party members feel that underrepresented communities have not been represented well in student government,” Melgoza said. “We can amplify those voices and build structures and build those relationships into the institution.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about The Response, visit twitter.com/TheResponseUCSB and facebook.com/The-Response-229273187412212/ or attend any of the informational sessions on Feb. 18 at 7 p.m. in the SRB, Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. in Santa Rosa Formal Lounge &amp; Santa Catalina Fiesta Room.</p>\n<h3>QUEER AND TRANS STUDENT BODY</h3>\n<p>Queer and Trans Student Body’s (QutSB) mission statement is as follows: “We, the Queer and Trans Student Body, support and affirm the diverse identities and lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, LGBTQ, two-spirit, heterosexual, and same-gender loving as individuals above all else.</p>\n<p>We strive to engage the student body in the propagation of inclusive spaces demanding greater accessibility to campus resources and taking action to end the silent epidemic of student hunger. We also acknowledge the systemic power dynamics existing in higher education are mirrored in the systematic misrepresentation of queer folk and people of color in Associated Students. We are F.I.E.R.C.E. (Food Insecurity, Inclusive Spaces, Education, Resources, Campus Climate, and Environment.)”</p>\n<p>QutSB member and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major Ernesto Piña said the party is running on an education-focused platform rather than a student-government-focused platform.</p>\n<p>“Instead of focusing on why you should run with our party or be in Associated Students, we are running on an education platform to make this space available to queer folk,” Piña said.</p>\n<p>Piña said QutSB differs from the other parties because of its grassroots perspective and unique, novice outlook on A.S.</p>\n<p>“If you see the current structure, every single new party that was started aside from ours were released by ex-senators or senators,” Piña said. “I believe each party has done tremendous work, but I do believe that it is a replication of stuff that has been done in the past.”<br>\nPiña said their party is focused on inclusivity.</p>\n<p>“We are inclusive to students who are interested in learning about the process of Associated Students through an education lens to realize why they should care,” Piña said. “You don’t have to be queer or trans to join our party. We are inclusive of heterosexual and cisgender individuals.”</p>\n<p>QutSB member and third-year environmental studies major Ryan Carr said QutSB wants to address forgotten issues in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on issues like the silent epidemic and issues of food insecurity on our campus,” Carr said. “We feel there is a misrepresentation of queer folk in A.S., and we want to fix that.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about QutSB, visit facebook.com/qutsb/ and twitter.com/qutsb or attend their informational session on Feb. 19 at 5 p.m. in the RCSGD (third floor of the SRB).</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on pages 1,4,5,6 of the Thursday, February 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68383\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68383\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/","id":2532,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2531,2530,2529],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie Hold Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.</p>\n<p>After months of negotiations, the two groups, each represented by two debaters, held an event to discuss the feasibility of a higher minimum wage and tuition-free public college.

id=\"caption-attachment-68326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andrew Gates, second-year economics and accounting major and member of College Republicans, began the debate by questioning the demographics of minimum wage workers.</p>\n<p>“This popular belief that minimum wage workers are low-income adults working 40 plus hours a week to fend for their families and children is simply not true,” Gates said. “In actuality, only about 4.7 percent of minimum wage workers are low-income adults providing for their families.”</p>\n<p>Gates then cited the U.S. Department of Labor to claim minimum wage has negative effects on the economy and employment.</p>\n<p>“The US Department of Labor’s own assessment of the first minimum wage — this was commissioned by FDR — found that it resulted in job losses for 30,000 to 50,000 workers,” Gates said. “That’s 10 to 15 percent of the 300,000 workers who previously earned below that.”</p>\n<p>Eric Villalobos, third-year religious studies major and head organizer of UCSB for Bernie, argued in favor of a minimum wage increase.</p>\n<p>“A 2013 study by the Chicago Fed [Chicago Federal Reserve] found that increasing the minimum wage even just to $9 an hour would increase consumer spending by $28 billion,” Villalobos said. “It frees up money from the employer and from the business and makes it goes into the lower wage workers’ pockets.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said raising the minimum wage can lead to an increase in employment.</p>\n<p>“So far there is no evidence that raising the minimum wage causes an increase in unemployment or job loss,” Villalobos said. “In fact, in a Goldman-Sachs analysis of 13 states which have raised their minimum wage, it found that states where minimum wage went up had faster employment growth than states where the minimum wage remained at its 2013 level.”</p>\n<p>Ron Papile, third-year economics major and executive director of College Republicans, responded to Villalobos’ claim by citing studies on labor and the food industry that show prices rise with wages.</p>\n<p>“A 2007 study from the federal reserve bank of Chicago found that restaurant prices unambiguously increased in response to minimum wage,” Papile said. “Furthermore, a study by the German Institute for the Study of Labor found that, especially in fast food restaurants, roughly two-thirds of the minimum wage increase would actually lead to price increases.”</p>\n<p>Papile then discussed price increases in fast food restaurants.</p>\n<p>“Think about something like McDonald’s or Taco Bell, where you have a product that costs only $1 to buy – a $1 burger or taco,” Papile said. “The only reason that the prices are so low is because they’re matching the benefits they can get to the cost of creating the products.”</p>\n<p>Guy Singer, third-year biopsychology major and co-chair of UCSB for Bernie, had the last word on the issue of minimum wage.</p>\n<p>“600 of the nation’s most prolific economists authored a collective letter in 2014 supporting the notion that reasonable minimum wage increases had little or no effect on employment,” Singer said. “Even from the small business owner’s perspective there’s quite a tight consensus on raising the minimum wage.”</p>\n<p>The debate then shifted to the issue of whether or not public universities should be tuition free.</p>\n<p>Villalobos began by arguing that free tuition is not a new concept and has been implemented in many countries.</p>\n<p>“The campaign would like to argue that this is not a radical idea; last year Germany eliminated tuition because they believed that charging students $1,300 dollars per year was discouraging Germans from going to college,” Villalobos said. “Next year Chile will do the same, as will Finland, Norway, Sweden and many other countries around the world.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos then discussed democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan to address student loans.</p>\n<p>“The formula for setting student loan interest rates would go back to where it was in 2006,” Villalobos said. “If this plan were in effect today interest rates on undergrad loans would drop from 4.29 percent to just 2.37 percent.”</p>\n<p>Gates said government subsidies would actually increase the cost of tuitions.</p>\n<p>“As government subsidizes tuition, the cost of tuition increases proportionately,” Gates said. “The federal reserve bank of New York found that tuition and fees increased in proportion to the number of eligible students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68325\"

id=\"caption-attachment-68325\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Gates also compared the concept of free tuition to the recent housing bubble and subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>“In 1995 when the government subsidized mortgage loans, banks began loaning indiscriminately knowing that the government would cover it, increasing demand for housing and driving up prices of homes,” Gates said. “As government subsidizes, tuitions are hiked because colleges have no incentive to reign in that cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>Singer responded by saying capable students should have the right to attend the colleges of their choice, regardless of income.</p>\n<p>“If you get accepted you should have the right to go to that university regardless of how much money your parents make,” Singer said. “The way we lose scientists and technological advancement is by selecting who gets to go university based on income.”</p>\n<p>Singer then defended the idea of socialism in public education.</p>\n<p>“A hundred years ago completely subsidized public high schools were called socialist, 300 years ago completely subsidized public elementary schools were called socialist, and now they say completely subsidized higher education is socialist,” Singer said. “How many times do we have to go through the process before we figure out that socialism isn’t a scary word?”</p>\n<p>Papile said the large increase in students at universities would negatively impact the ability of students to take impacted classes.</p>\n<p>“Graduating with a bachelor’s degree in six years is actually about 59 percent of students, which to me is a very shocking statistic and shows how impacted classes currently are and how difficult it is to get them,” Papile said. “If we flood colleges with more students, it’s only going to make classes harder to get into.”</p>\n<p>Papile also said private universities would be unable to compete with public universities if public university tuition was free.</p>\n<p>“How are private universities going to compete with public universities if public universities are going to offer free tuition,” Papile said.</p>\n<p>Emily Anne Williams, a first-year linguistics major, said she thought the debaters were well-informed and prepared.</p>\n<p>“I think both sides did very well,” Williams said. “I heard a lot of statistics thrown around, which I think most college students don’t know about, and it was nice to see four people who actually did research.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Reardon, third-year physics and philosophy double major and president of College Republicans, said he was happy with how the speakers handled the debate.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleasantly surprised and, honestly, there aren’t many ways it could have gone better,” Reardon said. “Nobody couldn’t answer a question, everyone was very well informed on the topic and I’m happy with how it went for both sides.”</p>\n<p>Emily Humpal, a third-year political science major, said she thought having the two clubs debate was beneficial for the student community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we have the two clubs coming together because we don’t have a lot of students active in the political arena,” Humpal said. “These issues affect us, and I think a lot more people need to know that.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An initial version of this article listed the name of College Republicans’ executive director as Ron Kapeel, when his actual name is Ron Papile. Also, the article states the debate addressed whether the federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 to $15.00 over the next 8 years. However, the topic was an increase over several year, not 8 specifically.</em><em>]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/","id":2529,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2528,2527,2526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Curtis Marez Lectures on Farm Worker Resistance Movements","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Curtis Marez, associate professor and chair of Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego, presented an interactive lecture about farm worker resistance movements on Tuesday in the Multicultural Center (MCC), bas...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68328\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68328\" data-attachment-id=\"68328\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/farming_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Farming_by Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68328\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Dr. Curtis Marez looks at how the appropriation of photography, film, video, and other technologies expressed a “farm worker futurism,” a set of farm worker social formations that faced off against corporate capitalism and government policies.

According to Marez, many farm workers have started social justice movements to combat inequalities created by corporate capitalism and government policies. Marez’s talk was the last lecture in the MCC’s Race Matters Series.</p>\n<p>Associate Professor in the Chican@ Studies Department Dolores Inés Casillas introduced Marez and said she has appreciated his writing since he was president of the American Studies Association.</p>\n<p>“I am excited to see him on our campus,” Casillas said. “Something that is really dear to my heart is that Curtis is the first person whose work I read. I read an article by him, and it was the first time I felt I had to email the person and tell them this was an incredible piece of writing.”</p>\n<p>Casillas said Marez’s hometown of Turlock, California is present in his writing and adds to his understanding of farming in the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>“He references not just the Central Valley, but in a way in which we understand that farm hands have created and cultivated a specific culture in the Central Valley,” Casillas said.</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers have been leaders in visionary thinking about the future of technology, but little is known of their work.</p>\n<p>“One index of farm worker exploitation is the fact that they have often been the objects, but rarely the subjects of media representation,” Marez said. “There is a vast archive of photos and films of farm workers, but there are far fewer well-known examples of visual media produced by them.”</p>\n<p>Marez said California farm workers unions have organized and created their own media to fight agribusiness domination of visual technology.</p>\n<p>“Farm workers have undermined agribusiness representations of workers as mere machines of production, by themselves mobilizing media technologies,” Marez said. “Appropriations of cameras and other visual technologies by farm worker unions have both material and symbolic force, making exploitation visible while simultaneously seizing the means of visual reproduction.”</p>\n<p>Marez showed attendees a clip of Cesar Chavez dancing to remind them of the utopian, world-changing arc of the farm worker’s movement. Cesar Chavez, American farm worker and labor rights activist, founded the United Farm Workers (UFW).</p>\n<p>“We are used to seeing Chavez in a serious mode,” Marez said. “Just remember that he was a person who danced, who had desires for pleasure and pursued those desires I think is something that is important. Part of what I wanted to talk about today is the utopian future orientation of United Farm Workers in what I am calling <em>Farm Worker: Futurism</em>.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, his book is an interdisciplinary study of the material and symbolic significance of technology in conflicts between agribusiness corporations and workers of color in California from the 1940s to present day.</p>\n<p>“An important practical and symbolic means of exploiting and disciplining labor [and] agribusiness technology also became the medium and object of struggle over the future of California agriculture and the larger cultural and political context supporting it,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez said farm workers have used technology to draw attention to the agribusiness flaws in using mechanized labor, industrial work camps and pesticides in the fields.</p>\n<p>“They have also responded to the agribusiness efforts to dominate the visual field by turning a critical gaze on agribusiness in numerous graphics, photos, films and videos, thus decoupling technology from an exclusive connection to patriarchal white capitalism,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez showed artwork by members of the Royal Chicano Air Force, a Chicano artist collective, and said the images show flight and the technologies of agribusiness, such as the crop duster.</p>\n<p>“All of the images in this project from the Royal Chicano Air Force are from special collections here at UC Santa Barbara,” Marez said. “So there is an incredibly rich collection of visual art related to the Chicano movement right here on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers unions have tried to mobilize media technology to open spaces for supporters. Marez said Cesar Chavez’s famous slogans “Si Se Puede” and “It Can Be Done” demonstrate the uniting qualities of the farm worker movement.</p>\n<p>“Qualities that resonated with post-war decolonization and third-wordlist movements,” Marez said. “The worlds that farm workers built were shaped by both local and global concerns.”</p>\n<p>Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman, Programmer of the MCC, said she enjoyed how Marez allowed the audience to choose a topic of discussion for his lecture.</p>\n<p>“I really appreciated how Dr. Marez was so interactive with the audience and allowed them to choose where to take the lecture. I have never seen anyone do that,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It could have been a totally different lecture if people chose different things — I thought that was interesting. I really find his work fascinating.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68336\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68336\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/","id":2533,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2532,2531,2530],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Students, Faculty Discuss ISIS and Refugees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Juergensmeyer_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Juergensmeyer_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Professor Mark Juergensmeyer, Director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, spoke to students and faculty Tuesday evening at Carrillo Dining Commons about the rise of both the I...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Professor Mark Juergensmeyer, Director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, spoke to students and faculty Tuesday evening at Carrillo Dining Commons about the rise of both the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamophobia in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The discussion, part of UCSB’s Faculty Nights series, served as a forum for students and staff with different perspectives to engage in conversation about the conflict in Iraq, the Syrian Civil War and the resulting refugee crisis.

According to a 2015 report, the United Nations believes ISIS is holding over 3,500 people as slaves and is responsible for the displacement and deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer opened the talk by discussing his recent experience interviewing refugees in Erbil, Iraq who were fleeing ISIS, which he said opened his perspective on what ISIS is and who is supporting it.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer recounted the tale of a refugee policeman whose cousin had joined simply because he was making more money than if he was fighting in the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>According to Juergensmeyer, the November terrorist attacks in Paris were a way for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “to show others that the war is real.”</p>\n<p>“He [al-Baghdadi] can go to Paris and put on a pretend war, and suddenly, he’s back in the headlines,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said for al-Baghdadi, recruiting foreigners to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been an effective strategy.</p>\n<p>“Al-Baghdadi is bringing them there as an intimidation force so that he can control the Sunnis in the region from rebelling and turning against him,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said although it is still present and dangerous threat, ISIS has recently lost momentum.</p>\n<p>“Not only did ISIS lose territory in 2015, but young people are fleeing from ISIS in droves,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Max Peck, third-year communication major and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, works at UCSB’s Veteran Resource Center and helped organize the event. Peck said the event aimed to shed light on the veteran community at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“One of my goals while I’m here is to make our community more visible, and I view this as a really good way to make us more visible, not only to faculty, but to students at UCSB,” Peck said.</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Charlie Wang said he took a global studies course with Juergensmeyer and considers him an authority on the issue of global terrorism.</p>\n<p>“Professor Juergensmeyer was very knowledgeable about different issues going on around the world, especially ISIS,” Wang said. “It was also very interesting to hear all the different perspectives from the different professors in different departments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major Nathan Garrido said he attended the event in pursuit of information on ISIS and its global influence.</p>\n<p>“The topic that was discussed is super relevant right now — it’s not a conversation that has been going on long enough and we have not had enough people involved,” Garrido said. “It was a great way to get faculty to interact with students and have this open discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-68330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congresswoman Lois Capps hosted a guest lecture in The Impact of the Vietnam War on American Religion and Culture course (RG ST 155) on Tuesday, accompanied by a panel comprised of mostly female United States war veterans to discuss the current condition of Vietnam War veterans in the United States.</p>\n<p>Capps’s late husband, UCSB Religious Studies Professor Walter Capps, originally developed and taught RG ST 155 in 1979. The class gained national attention during this time, and had a peak enrollment of nearly 900 students. The discussion panel featured Wilson, a Vietnam War veteran, Marty McGrath, a US Navy air traffic controller third class, Janice Summers, a US Navy Officer third class dental technician and Vietnam War veteran, Penny Turner, U.S. Army air defense artillery desert storm and Arlene Sandoval, a US Airforce senior airman and aerospace medical technician. Each gave an account of their experiences during and after their time of service.</p>\n<p>Representative Capps said many Vietnam War veterans were not treated fairly when they returned from service.</p>\n<p>“Some [veterans] hid up in the hills. There was no re-entry program. There was no phrase ‘post-traumatic stress disorder,’” Capps said. “They were alienated, disoriented, couldn’t talk to their families, couldn’t speak to anyone about it. So some fought back, some withdrew and it wasn’t healthy.”</p>\n<p>Capps said her husband Walter started teaching the course during a time of tension caused by the negative public reactions toward the war.</p>\n<p>“There was an era of time when he had to walk through smoke in Isla Vista to get to class. The Bank of America burned. It was wild. It was violent. The country tore itself apart over this war,” Capps said. “And who were the victims? The soldiers. The people who had nothing to do with causing it or the impact that it had on society.”</p>\n<p>McGrath is currently a volunteer at the Veterans Treatment Court in Santa Maria, California. She described the conditions of the veterans that typically come in for help and what she does for them.</p>\n<p>“They’re still suffering … they have serious problems, they encounter the law,” McGrath said. “Rather than go to jail and serve time for no constructive reason, Judge Flores created the Veterans treatment court … in that court we get to see the PTSD … Times have changed and they get professional assessment.”</p>\n<p>McGrath recounted her time in the service, saying, “Out of 12 years of Catholic School with the Irish nuns, going into boot camp was a piece of cake.”</p>\n<p>US Navy Officer and third class dental technician Janice Summers discussed the progress of veterans today and the support system established to help other veterans.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them [veterans] are actually giving back,” Summers said. “Yes, it was a terrible time. Yes, I was spit on. Even after the riots … even after our barracks got raided on … you have to move forward. If you have a situation, you can never let it get the best of you.”</p>\n<p>Turner said veterans need the help of the public and of those around them to overcome their traumatic experiences.</p>\n<p>“I ask you to remember us and to help support us — not financially, because most of us don’t want nothing. There’s nothing you can give me,” Turner said. “But to support us with love, dignity and compassion that we’re entitled to, that we picked up arms to do for you.”</p>\n<p>Veteran Wilson said he still suffered as a veteran of the Vietnam War through a form of unique cancer caused by exposure to the warfare herbicide, Agent Orange.</p>\n<p>“I was killed in Vietnam, I just haven’t fallen yet,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>At the end of the discussion, Representative Capps was given a coin in celebration of American women in military service.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68333\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68333\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/","id":2530,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[2529,2528,2527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ex-Student Pleads Not Guilty in 2014 Campus Rape","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be held without bail.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held without bail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel J.

that photographers should not be allowed to take pictures of the proceedings Tuesday because of what he said was the “potential prejudice for potential jurors seeing Mr. Chen in a jail uniform,” but the judge ultimately allowed photographs by the press.</span></p>\n<p>When Ladinig was asked if he was considering a plea deal in exchange for the two other suspects, he said, “As of now, we’re just

Senate met in the Flying A Room of the UCen Wednesday evening to discuss the creation of new offices, organization funding, free speech issues and a threat of a letter of no confidence from S.C.O.R.E.</p>\n<p>Senate funded the Formal Office of Sustainability, the UStudy program and the honorarium of speaker Alexis Pauline Gumbs for the annual Womyn of Color Conference. The senate also sent a resolution to External Affairs supporting the “Idaho stop,” a plan that would allow bicyclists to slow down at stop signs instead of stopping completely. Young Americans for Liberty members addressed free speech issues and a Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) member addressed concerns with proposed committee resolutions.</p>\n<p>Cassie Rubio, fourth-year comparative literature and global studies double major, said the senate should be devoting their resources to minority groups.</p>\n<p>“Given some of the events happening on campus this year, given [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] CBP being on our campus, given that, from what I hear, funding has just been given to a group on campus with homophobic beliefs last week, we feel that it’s necessary to invest in marginalized groups like women of color specifically,” Rubio said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted 13-3-1 to table the request indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Austin Amato, third-year economics and accounting major, represented Reserve Officers’ Training Corp (ROTC) in requesting early pass times for ROTC members who will go into active service upon graduation.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate requested ROTC address the academic senate and the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>Travis Taylor, UCen representative and fourth-year sociology major, requested $600 to hold UStudy, a program that would allow the UCen to be open 24 hours during finals week. The request was tabled indefinitely by A.S. F&amp;B on Monday.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted to fully fund the request.</p>\n<p>Brandon Morse, President of Young Americans for Liberty and fourth-year political science major, called for a resolution protecting free speech rights.</p>\n<p>Morse said there have been recent threats made against him as President of Young Americans for Liberty and Jason Garshfield, vice-president and fourth-year political science major.</p>\n<p>“We have students on this campus threatening members of my club with stabbing them because they’re exercising their First Amendment right,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Morse said the Graduate Student Association’s (GSA) statement of solidarity, which condemned hate speech, was not based on factual evidence and used inappropriate language.</p>\n<p>“With all respect to the GSA and the fallacious points of view they have presented to this campus, they have no rationality for anything they’re saying,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Morse said making a threat to anyone, regardless of the intention of carrying it out, is a crime that should be taken seriously regardless of that person’s identity.</p>\n<p>“If I or any member of my club were to make that same comment to somebody else, there would be an uproar on our campus,” Morse said. “I think this type of language is ridiculous and especially having the Graduate Student Association come in with nothing but rhetoric and attack someone exercising their First Amendment right is ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said attacks against people exercising their First Amendment rights will not improve if the senate does not take legislative action.</p>\n<p>“As long as we do not pass resolutions supporting free speech, incidents like this will continue to happen because A.S. will not have taken a stance,” Garshfield said. “I think the events over the last several weeks prove the necessity of a resolution.”</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, (S.C.O.R.E.) representative and second-year history of public policy and environmental studies double major gave a quarterly report about the success of their recent Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Workshop.</p>\n<p>Kris said resolutions to create committees to hire senators makes him “extremely” uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>“Some of the same senators that were involved in the controversial process of picking recently appointed senators are either chairing or vice-chairing these committees,” Kris said. “These are the same senators who are currently being investigated for potentially violating legal code.”</p>\n<p>Kris said the process will not adequately reflect students’ voice in student government.</p>\n<p>“It does not reflect democratic process. It makes students who want to participate in A.S. shy away from it.”</p>\n<p>Kris said if the resolution regarding the committees passes, various student groups and Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations will release a statement of no confidence toward the senate.</p>\n<p>Representing Environmental Affairs Board, Nick Frey, third-year computer science and environmental studies double major, said the university needs the Formal Office of Sustainability to achieve UCSB’s green environment goals over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>“We believe that a Formal Office of Sustainability is necessary if we want to achieve our campus goals of being carbon-free by 2020 and waste-free by 2025,” Frey said. “All the other UCs have a similar office, so I believe it’s something overdue for our campus.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted 16-0-1 to create a Formal Office of Sustainability</p>\n<p>Jerel Constantino, off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy major, introduced a resolution calling upon UCPD, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department and California Highway Patrol to support the Iowa Stop.</p>\n<p>“This is a response to, I believe, Paula coming to senate in her weekly report saying that UCPD was going to begin a crackdown on bicycles running stop signs,” Constantino said, “However, research shows that it’s less safe for bicycles to stop.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Womyn’s Commission requested $2,050 for an honorarium for Alexis Pauline Gumbs as a speaker for their Annual Womyn of Color Conference, a request A.S. Finance and Business Committee (A.S. F&amp;B) tabled indefinitely on Monday.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate also voted on Senator Alejandra Melgoza retaining her off-campus senator position despite moving into university housing.

Public Safety Commission.</p>\n<p>A full house was present at Embarcadero Hall as Sferios discussed the history of MDMA, its therapeutic use and public policies regarding the drug. He offered harm reduction strategies, sold drug testing kits and reminded attendees that no drug use is completely safe.</p>\n<p>Marjan Riazi, graduate from UCSB and education and outreach coordinator for the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, said it is important students are informed on the effects of drug use and safest possible methods if they choose to experiment.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited that you are all here talking about something that is really important and certainly impacts our community,” Riazi said. “We are telling you learn the facts, learn the information … be safe, we just want you to known all the facts. Sometimes people hear things, especially in Isla Vista, that isn’t necessarily true especially when it comes to substances like MDMA.”</p>\n<p>Cole Garcia, SSDP chapter leader and a second-year biology major, said the goal of SSDP is to educate students on drug safety and public policies that can be ineffective.</p>\n<p>“Within the Isla Vista community we are working on similar things to the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, so harm reduction through education, but another goal of our group is to get future voters in our political system well educated on the ways that drug policy can be improved,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said universities typically focus on abstinence when discussing drug use, but they should instead take the same stance as they have on alcohol and educate students on how to partake as safely as possible if one chooses to do so.</p>\n<p>“The university doesn’t say just ‘don’t drink, just don’t do it!’ They say, ‘ok we know some people will and if you do you need to know what you are doing to be safe,’” Sferios said. “That same approach really needs to be happening with party drugs like MDMA and I am really glad to see that Life of the Party is here doing that.”</p>\n<p>According to Sferios, prohibition of MDMA creates a more dangerous situation in which safety education is often neglected.</p>\n<p>“I realized DanceSafe and other harm reduction programs are more trying to counter the harm that results from our drug policies,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said there are beneficial therapeutic uses of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD, because it releases the brain’s stored serotonin.</p>\n<p>“The receptors of serotonin are excitatory and inhibitory in all the right places to reduce anxiety while at the same time making the person very alert and increasing activity in the forebrain where you put things in context and look at traumatic experiences without fear,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the drug is always beneficial, as 15 to 20 people a year in the United States die after taking MDMA, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“I was told by Life of the Party that in the last five years there have been 10 deaths on this campus related to alcohol and prescription drugs but none related to Molly as far as I know on this campus,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said legal drugs may have a much higher fatality rate in the United States.<br>\n“Aspirin kills 400 people a year,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Users of MDMA should be weary of over-heating and take time to cool down and drink water to stay hydrated, because serotonin-based drugs increase the risk of heat stroke by limiting the body’s thermoregulation, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“There is a warning label on Prozac for the same reasons,” Sferios said. “Who has ever had a warning label when they bought their MDMA from a dealer that said be careful? No, that is because the drug is illegal and this kind of life-saving essential information is not allowed.”</p>\n<p>Sferios said public policy should aim to reduce “adulterated criminal market” that provides minors with MDMA and lacks safety regulation.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really want MDMA available in convenience stores, right? We want to protect young people, we want to protect our children,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said he recommends a regulated dispensary system through which adults could obtain pure, legal MDMA.</p>\n<p>“We would reduce the criminal market and reduce access to minors,” Sferios said. “You would still have some adults diverge and buying it and giving it to minors, but you would limit the amount of adults, you limit that process.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-68110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Black South African activists Jamie Mithi and Khanyisa Pinini discussed their views on labeling Israel an apartheid state in an event hosted by Gauchos United for Israel on Tuesday in the Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>Mithi, originally from Zimbabwe, is an author and law student at University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg. He is an avid debater, ranked fourth globally and first in Africa in the World Universities Public Speaking Championship. Pinini, originally from Johannesburg, has been heavily involved with student leadership at University of Cape Town (UCT) and is a member of the United Nations Association of South Africa: UCT Chapter and has participated two times in national Model United Nations conferences.</p>\n<p>Mithi and Pinini both shared their personal experiences with apartheid in South Africa and how their own narratives informed their definitions of the term “apartheid.” Both said they used to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, but withdrew their support after visiting Israel. The two speakers said they have felt a loss of Black South African apartheid narrative due to the use of the term to label Israel when referring to conflict with Palestine.</p>\n<p>Mithi first proposed that a major difference between an apartheid state and the status of Israel is historical context. In the context of debate, he presented the claim that Israel is a colonial-settler state, then refuted this idea by stating there cannot be a colonial-settler state if said settlers already existed within an area.</p>\n<p>“It is a non sequitur for us to claim that people who have always had a presence in a particular area, are colonizers of the area if they’ve always been there,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>The second level of Mithi’s argument focused on the legislative structure of apartheid versus that of the state of Israel. He said apartheid law’s “four levels of existence,” which are based upon racial discrimination, are “just not the way it is” in Israel’s legal system.</p>\n<p>“In Israel, all Israeli citizens have the same rights,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>This difference in citizen rights is what he argues sets apartheid and the Israeli state apart.</p>\n<p>His third level of debate focused on the context of the area. He said conflicts in the surrounding areas of Israel are what “led to the conflicts in the West Bank.” This war-zone environment is another factor, according to Mithi, that sets true apartheid apart from the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“It would be complete false argumentation and academically insincere to say that’s apartheid,” Mithi said. “The reality is, what I’m talking about, the scenario of ‘peaceful neighbor,’ where I’m talking about a scenario where the neighbors aren’t seeing eye to eye, right?”</p>\n<p>In his closing statement, Mithi said when discussing Israel-Palestine conflict, neither side should vilify the other.</p>\n<p>“There is a problem in Israel [and] Palestine, and largely in the Middle East. And I don’t think that the tactic of demonizing the other side leads to the relevant solution,” Mithi said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68109\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68109\" data-attachment-id=\"68109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/activists-discuss-israel-apartheid-state-label/apartheid_by-spencer-brandt-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Apartheid_by Spencer Brandt-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68109\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Michelle May, a second-year biology major, said she was impressed by Mithi and Pinini’s expertise.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t come here expecting anything, I found it really interesting to hear [about the conflict] from a South African point of view, coming from a family that has experienced apartheid,” May said. “And they’re obviously really educated about both topics.”</p>\n<p>Event organizer Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, said the event exceeded her expectations.</p>\n<p>“It was really great to see the number of people that came out to an event like this.

promote healthy living for residents, becoming the second county in California to do so.</p>\n<p>The resolution will ensure residents have access to locally grown produce and provide healthier food options in schools, as well as education about living healthy lifestyles.</p>\n<p>First District County Supervisor Salud Carbajal is working with the County to maintain the new resolution and said he hopes the program will reach everyone who is interested in learning about a healthy lifestyle, no matter their current level of health.</p>\n<p>“I think we are targeting everyone in general,” Carbajal said. “There are disparities in health issues in our community with various groups and income levels, but I think that our goal is to approach the entire community with an understanding that certain communities need a little extra outreach and consideration.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said the resolution will help people understand ways to live healthy lives and hopes the program will develop into a community effort.</p>\n<p>“Once you make it a community-wide effort, it becomes part of our values in our community to exercise, to be conscious of having a healthier diet,” Carbajal said. “And to understand there are some basic things we can do to create wellness and health to prevent certain devastating, long-term medical conditions that only diminish our quality of life or result in huge costs of medical debts.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said implementing the principles of the resolution will be an effortful process.</p>\n<p>“We will come up with a strategic plan and identify some specific goals whether it be environmental or healthy foods or even employee wellness,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Trina Long, coordinator of the Nutritional Service Program with the Public Health Department and chair of Live Well Santa Barbra County Coalition, said although H.E.A.L. has collaborated with many entities, the Coalition is at the forefront of the program.</p>\n<p>“There are lots of different partners that have been and are continuing to work on different initiatives in our county that focus on healthy living and active eating,” Long said. “The Live Well Coalition is the backbone of that partnership. There are different organizations, agencies and government officials with an interest in nutrition, physical activity, environmental health and public healthy eating and active living.”</p>\n<p>According to Long, the Coalition takes community members’ opinions into consideration when making healthy lifestyle plans.</p>\n<p>“What we do is look at it as addressing it in a collective impact type of way,” Long said. “We have different goals and objectives but when we start talking down to the nitty-gritty, we realize that even though our county program is focused on healthy eating and active living, when we start talking with our partners and with community members, we hear about barriers that need to be addressed in order for us to be successful in getting people to eat healthier and get active.”</p>\n<p>Long said the Coalition will use community-based education and policy formation to promote H.E.A.L.’s message.</p>\n<p>“A group of our coalition partners that are interested in H.E.A.L. are working on getting the word out to private businesses and individuals that can make changes that would support a healthier environment and living for themselves,” Long said.</p>\n<p>Long said involvement from other local groups and businesses will be important to H.E.A.L.’s success.</p>\n<p>“We are planning different ways to get the word out about H.E.A.L., possibly a speakers bureau to cities who do not have a H.E.A.L. resolution yet,” Long said. “Also, reaching out to community clubs and organizations such as the Rotary Club to provide information about H.E.A.L. and offer ways that they could bring this back to their employer.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District County Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who collaborated with Carbajal to pass the resolution, said he believes it is something everyone in the County should support.</p>\n<p>“Who is going to oppose trying to get kids to eat healthy and be active? It’s one of those things everybody talks about but we need to have everyone tied in,” Lavagnino said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, the resolution aims to prompt individual County residents to make changes.</p>\n<p>“It must become a lifestyle change and not just a resolution that we’re passing,” Lavagnino said. “We need to get people’s awareness up so they can make healthier decisions in their life.”</p>\n<p>Third-year English major Olivia Kapheim said she will appreciate knowing there is a County-level effort to support healthy lifestyles among residents.</p>\n<p>“I keep up on my sleep and eat healthy meals and not just snacking throughout the day,” Kapheim said. “I think a healthy lifestyle is doable on your own, but it would be nice to have community support.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/","id":2552,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[2551,2550,2549],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":53,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
