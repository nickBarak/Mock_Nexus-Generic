The piano-like instrument is played with fists and feet, rather than fingers. The stronger the batons are pushed, the harder the clapper strikes the bell and thus the greater the volume produced, Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most important thing I want is for people to realize that it’s a musical instrument … [the hour chime] that part is automated but the music you hear is played by a real person,”  he said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89703\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89703\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89703\" data-attachment-id=\"89703\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Storke Bells_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89703\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon is the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai has been playing the instrument since his time at UC Berkeley, where he received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics and later obtained his master’s degree in mathematics at UC Los Angeles.

There are less than 700 carillons in the world, Arai explained, and less than 180 in North America. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a carillion instructor, Arai hosts concerts, plays on the weekends and continues teaching students, three at any given time, how to play. These students get to practice in the tower on the weekends as well as on the practice carillon in the basement of the music department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be a hard instrument… No other instrument uses similar motions, except the organ, to a small extent, with the foot pedals,” Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai’s next formal carillion performance will be for the official 50th anniversary concert for Storke Tower on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019 at 2 p.m.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be performing several works, including some commissioned specifically for the 50th anniversary of the carillon.

But now, at the end of her second year, she does not believe that the program was made for people like her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man,” Eseka said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her experience with the Honors Program underscores an issue that has loomed over the department’s staff for years — the program’s demographic fails to reflect the diversity of students that exists in UCSB’s student body as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2018-2019 school year, UCSB boasted one of the most diverse student bodies of any college in the nation, snagging 14th place in “Best Ethnic Diversity” among public national universities by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News &amp; World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019172/top-five\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advertised by the university at the time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the Honors Program told a different story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost half of the 1,713 students in the honors program in 2018-19 school year identified as white or Caucasian, despite white or Caucasian students making up only about 30% of the total student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicanx/Latinx and Black/African American populations in the Honors Program represented less than half of their respective proportions in the student body, according to numbers from UCSB’s Office of Budget &amp; Planning in the 2018-19 school year. Chicanx/Latinx students made up about 12% of the Honors Program compared to 29% of the student body; Black/African American students made up about two percent of the Honors Program compared to five percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-KN8eC\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of UCSB Undergraduates Campuswide vs. in the Honors Program, 2018-19\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KN8eC/3/\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of nearly 40 Black students in the program, Eseka doesn’t always see diversity at program activities, such as honor seminars, and she said the university could be doing more to support people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chance of me being the only Black person in that class is really high and sometimes maybe as an honors [student], you might get second looks, like ‘Are you in the right place?’ and you have to be like ‘Yeah, I am,’” Eseka said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Eseka, feeling comfortable in the Honors Program is key to recruiting and retaining people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Diversity is really necessary to encourage more people to come to the program and then to stay in the program, so you don’t feel lonely or feel left out or singled out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of the new honors students enrolling for the 2019-2020 school year, diversity statistics aren’t improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the incoming group of freshmen – the class of 2023 – invited to join the Honors Program, almost half of the students are white. Chicanx, Latinx and African American students collectively make up less than 10% of the honors-eligible students. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-eoOjm\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of Incoming UCSB Freshman Admitted to the Honors Program, Fall 2019\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eoOjm/6/\" height=\"458\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, is one person in the honors departments who has kept the issue of diversity on his radar. When he first started to look more closely at the honors department about three years ago, Stopple noted several concerns with the way the program had been functioning, particularly with how the program included and supported diverse student populations at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a high rate of attrition, of students not staying in the program. There was also a concern that the program didn’t represent the diversity of UCSB [because] it was not particularly diverse,” Stopple said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But three years since Stopple’s arrival, the diversity of students in the program still lags behind the diversity of the campus as a whole. Stopple said his office has worked in several ways to modify the program to support students of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those efforts is the collaborative Q&amp;A panel discussion put on in May 2019 by Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the honors department. Over a hundred first-year students who were on track to meet the honors requirements were invited to attend the information panel to hear from current EOP honors students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said the panel, which he started in 2017, has been effective in recruiting more diverse students to the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eseka spoke alongside Stella Delgado, a UCSB third-year history of public policy and anthropology double major, as panelists during the event. The two discussed EOP students’ concerns about the “intimidation” factor of the Honors Program. Some students felt the “elitist” reputation of the Honors Program was something that gave them reservations about applying, Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Delgado, the program’s lack of diversity points to “the different challenges students of color face on campus and the different challenges students from lower-income communities also face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a student of color and a low-income student, I’ve had to maintain having a job for most of my time at UCSB, which has taken away from academics,” Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can enter the program in two ways: by being invited into the Honors Program when admitted to the university or by applying to the program the summer after their freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising sophomores are required to adhere to a 3.5 GPA and 36 letter-graded units requirement to enter the program, Stopple said.  Students can apply for the program in July and are admitted so long as they meet the GPA and unit requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said GPA is a “crude” metric and that he “would prefer to do something different.” But for now, due to “limited resources,” the honors department cannot incorporate more criteria for their application process besides the “purely quantitative” measures currently in place, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple did, however, lower the GPA requirement for the honors program from 3.6 to 3.5 in June 2017 in order to include more students in the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that come with being in the Honors Program; one, Stopple said, is having priority enrollment, which allows honors students to be among the first to enroll in classes during pass times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other advantages that come with being in the Honors Program include access to special academic advising, extended library privileges and academic and community service opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise of one-on-one time with professors, building relationships for letters of recommendations and beefing up resumes with honors status draws many students to the program. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle McKee, a recent graduate of the Honors Program, said “it’s very hard to get one-on-one time with the professors and to really talk with and work with the professors” without having the advantages of the Honors Program.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She joined the Honors Program after her freshman year and said the perks benefitted her education at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The day-one pass time is a plus,” she said. “But I also just knew that there were a lot of great opportunities if you were involved in the Honors Program including these really cool honors seminars and I’ve just been able to take so many interesting classes that I wouldn’t have taken otherwise.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB honors student, Michael Stallworth, said his experience in the Honors Program helped him get settled into the university and allowed him to “work with other people who are like-minded and just want to… achieve as much as they can.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth noted that a diverse honors program would indicate a university that adequately supports students of color and students from unique backgrounds, something still in the works at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just shows that we have people from different communities who are able to be successful at UCSB and still be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered,” Stallworth said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the experience of each student in the Honors Program varies, many agree that increasing and supporting diverse populations in the program remains an important goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know how much more opportunities and advantages I get being in the Honors Program between volunteer opportunities, earlier pass times, separate advisors,” said Zeina Safadi, an honors fourth-year political science major. “And so it would be disheartening to think that it was only to a specific group of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Eseka said the root of the problem is in the way minority students perceive the Honors Program, and given the unique challenges they already face at UCSB, honors could be exactly what these students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You hear honors [and] you think ‘I’m not meant for this,’ not because you don’t have the credentials, but just because… historically, as a low-income first generation minority, you’ve…  had so many barriers that have prevented you from getting here faster or at the same pace as others.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Eseka, the Honors Program makes achieving her academic and career goals a little bit easier. The distinction of being in the Honors Program in college is an edge that she said she needs to accomplish her goals after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s one reason why I keep on going because I know I’m gonna hit so many barriers. It’s just gonna make it one less hoop.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

According to Stephany Romero, assistant director of UCSB Orientation Programs &amp; Parent Services, the change came about after she recognized the demand for the full program in Spanish and got to work recruiting department representatives for Spanish workshops.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero assembled the Orientation for Spanish-Speaking Parents Committee with colleagues from various departments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the College of Letters and Science, and began the task of translating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to translate a lot of the material that is already in our English orientation into Spanish and quickly find presenters from those offices to do those presentations,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quick turnaround necessary for the program, along with the task of translating, did not give the Orientation Programs office the opportunity for as much outreach to parents and students as they had hoped, Romero said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she believes the program was still a great success this summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Considering we didn’t advertise a lot, we got a pretty good turnout,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of those parents actually didn’t know there was a Spanish parent orientation program and would come hoping they would just be able to understand something off of the English one,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were so relieved when we approached them and let them know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina, a fourth-year sociology and comparative literature double major, enjoyed working directly with the Spanish-speaking parents for most of the two-day sessions, as she could personally relate to their questions and concerns for their new students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a [first-generation student] from immigrant parents, I was able to give them my experiences of what it’s like being a student in the university,” she said. “I think that really helped them feel more comfortable with their students coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the goals of parent orientation is to encourage students and parents to create an open line of communication about academics, Medina said. Giving Spanish-speaking parents this same opportunity is equally as important, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would give parents genuine stories of things I wish I would’ve been able to speak more to my parents about,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to college can be especially hard for first-generation students and their parents if they have no experience with universities, Medina emphasized. She said something as simple as giving Spanish-speaking parents a translated list of campus resources helps them feel more comfortable about the university their children are attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a lot of us don’t realize is the university is such a foreign space for people who haven’t experienced it, and it can seem very intimidating… I know now that if these parents have information, they’re able to support their students and be here for them, provide them with resources and answers and let them know they belong here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of the program is personal for Romero as well, who, as a first-generation alumna of UCSB, has a background similar to those of the students she helps with the Spanish parent orientations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to this school, and I was also [first-generation],” she said. “And I know that if my mom had known some of the information that we have provided to our parents now, my experience here would have been 100% different because I would have had the proper support.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero said this program will allow Spanish-speaking parents to support their students in ways that other parents have already had the opportunity to; parents now have knowledge of campus resources to be able to answer questions that students might have regarding academics because they had the opportunity to communicate with department representatives directly at orientation, according to Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it’s a major deal they get the same information the other parents are getting so that they’re as well informed,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina said she and her co-workers also received a lot of support from staff of the English-speaking program, who along with other UCSB staff were excited to see the Spanish events taking place and “would always hang around or peep into the presentation[s].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the translated material established and ready to go for future summers, the program aims to expand advertising efforts and add more department presentations to its schedule and possibly even work with the other UC campuses and their orientation programs, according to Romero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime I see a parent, I envision my mom and the happiness she would get to not only be given information, but to be seen as a normal human being, not just some foreign person,” Romero said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are present, they also need help and they are also parents trying to support their child.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Thirty six died and nearly one hundred were injured across the three mass shootings, which all happened within the span of a week.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gathering was organized over Facebook by Armbruster-Sandoval and Amanda Pinheiro, a graduate student in the UCSB Global Studies department, less than 24 hours earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcus Lopez, a local activist and Chumash native, opened the vigil with a blessing and performed a native healing song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees were invited to step forward and speak their minds. Most messages centered around community and a common humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that power is found in the community,” one attendee said. “We must stand together as a community.

Music and melodies… get into the heart space. And as that space can open up, we can tap into a field of love. And that is what we really need right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others reflected on their hope for future action to prevent such tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think hope is sometimes the only thing that we have to hold on to,” said one attendee. “But it is powerful. Because hope can lead to action. If we all put in our little piece of work, we can transform our communities, we can transform our state, we can transform our country. You each have a lot of power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see an awakening,” said Campobello. “People are less able to remain complacent and are being called to action because things have been so bad.

Yang, with Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “in addition to comprehensively reviewing the allegations contained in the lawsuit and UCPD responses, the University has engaged an outside agency to conduct a thorough, independent investigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brock </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">started</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB on April 29 following the departure of former Chief Dustin Olson, who is named in the lawsuits.

400;\">The policies, according to the lawsuit, include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2015 Interim Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence, implemented on 6/17/2015</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California PACAOS-Appendix-E: Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 1/1/2016</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, implemented on 1/1/2016 </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Interim Appendix E – Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH) Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 3/1/2019</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All local University of California campus procedures modeled after the aforementioned system-wide policies</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the UC Regents uses an investigation model that has been found unlawful in previous court cases, referencing the January 2019 case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the case, the court ruled that students accused of sexual misconduct in cases where the credibility of witness reports are central to the claim must be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses — either directly or indirectly and in person or through a method like videoconferencing, in front of a neutral judge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the UC’s investigation model, the responsibility for the investigation falls to “a single [Title IX investigator] who acted as police, prosecutor, jury, and judge without a live, in-person hearing before impartial adjudicators where the accused could question or cross-examine the complainant and witnesses,” the suit alleges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC changed its adjudication process in March 2019 after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling to comply with the live hearing requirement. On July 31, the UC unveiled a more comprehensive guide to the hearing process, one that is “fair, treats parties with respect and compassion, and results in just and reliable outcomes,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/student-adjudication-framework/interim-svhs-student-adjudication-framework-ppt.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July SVSH Student Investigation and Adjudication Framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s suit represents those who were disciplined under the policies before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s specific Title IX case began in February 2017, court documents say, when UCLA’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity received a report that Doe had allegedly sexually harassed and stalked another student on multiple occasions between September 2016 and February 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit says Doe cooperated with the school, “meeting with the Title IX investigator several times and providing documents to support his defense that the allegations against him were entirely false.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe alleges that he asked for access to the evidence collected by the investigator but had his requests denied by both the investigator and UCLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that while the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of either stalking or sexual harassment, the Title IX investigator concluded there was a “preponderance of evidence” that Doe had engaged in sexual harassment and stalking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCLA Student Conduct Officer then confirmed the Title IX investigator’s findings and suspended Doe for two years. Doe appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body found him responsible of sexual harassment but not stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe once again appealed the decision, arguing that “the finding was made in the absence of evidence supporting the elements of sexual harassment in the Policy and the application of a minimum one-year suspension for ‘other sexual contact’ in the absence of any contact whatsoever was improper.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His suspension was reduced to three months, but he was required to reapply to UCLA and “submit documentation of his ability to be a student ‘without engaging in any behavior that would violate university policy.’” He would also be placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of his time at UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second proposed class member in the lawsuit, John Doe2, was a graduate student at an unnamed UC campus in 2016 when he was notified in March that the campus’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity had been notified of research misconduct and stalking allegations against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was ordered to stay 100 yards from the graduate student he allegedly harassed, and he was restricted from his research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Doe’s case, Doe2 alleges that he cooperated with the investigation and provided evidence that proved the allegations against him false, and was also not allowed to see other evidence collected by the investigator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of stalking, computer hacking or that “any online accounts were compromised or hacked,” but Doe2 was found guilty of stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 says in the suit that there were 113 exhibits of evidence that were not provided to him and 40 unidentified witnesses who were not named, even though he repeatedly requested the evidence and the witness statements, including through the California Public Records Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was suspended for two years, but he appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body decided he was not responsible for violating the stalking and sexual violence policies, only the physical abuse policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 appealed the decision once again but had his appeal denied. He then filed a writ to “set aside the improper administrative finding that [he] is responsible for a violation of Conduct Policy 102.08 and the one-year suspension.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court ruled in Doe2’s favor, and the university started a new Title IX investigation in December 2018. Doe2 alleges there has been no action from the university since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC spokesperson Claire Doan said they had not been served with the lawsuit and had no comment at this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Alvarez, Title IX director at UCSB, said she believed the Title IX process offered students due process and declined to comment on the case specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Court has reversed three UC Santa Barbara Title IX decisions in the last year, noting a lack of due process in the Title IX process in each case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Donna D. Geck agreed with the student’s claim that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and ruled that the UC Regents failed to provide the student with a fair hearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Geck again called attention to the Title IX process, writing in the decision that in the university’s hearing, “Noticeably absent was even a semblance of due process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the accused does not receive a fair hearing, neither does the accuser,” Geck added in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucsb-student-exonerated-from-relationship-violence-charges-after-629-days/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Thomas P. Anderle found that the school predetermined the student’s guilt, thus violating the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</span></p>\n<p>The full lawsuit can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190802-Amended-Petition.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [8/9]: This article has been updated to include a link to the full lawsuit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

As many as 28 different types of light bulbs sold at the five major retailers allegedly contain patented technology, according to the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that from 2010 to 2019, researchers at UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) patented a series of four innovations that allowed LED lights to mimic the orange glow of Thomas Edison’s clear incandescent light bulbs without toxic filaments and at a fraction of the cost, according to court documents obtained from Levy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documents, all of which are duplicates save for minor changes, credit three full-time UCSB professors with inventing the patents: James “Jim” Speck, Steven DenBaars and Shuji Nakamura, who was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All are materials professors within the College of Engineering. DenBaars is also an electrical and computer engineering professor, while Nakamura is the solid state lighting and energy center co-director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakamura did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the alleged patent infringements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joseph “Joe” Incandela, vice chancellor for research at UCSB, said in a statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the unpaid royalties from the retailers in the lawsuit can be put back into “future research, education, and the development of new technologies.” Incandela is also a physics professor at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that the action taken by UC Santa Barbara will underline the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,” Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court complaints note that “substantially all” light fixtures allegedly produced using UCSB’s filament technology are manufactured in China. Target and Walmart had knowledge of patented technology on their shelves as early as December 2017, according to court complaints, when the two stores were sent a “notice of infringement” from the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The strategy has been to reach out directly to the retailers because the products are primarily made overseas, which makes it impractical and difficult for UC to pursue infringement,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, UCSB made efforts to form licensing agreements with retailers outside of court, Levy said, but was stiff-armed by retailers after unsuccessful attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Businesses, particularly certain industry sectors like these sorts of consumer products, tend to either ignore or just discount any outreach they have from a university about their need for a license,” Levy said. “They don’t think a university is actually going to enforce those patents, so they just ignore it and carry that risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in 2019, five years after patented products allegedly began saturating the market, UCSB is seeking litigation. The university was hesitant to sue, Levy said: “Litigation, especially of this scale, is a last resort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy noted that UCSB’s Office of Technology and Industry Alliances made “a lot of efforts to have business conversations with appropriate entities in the lighting industry,” but said they had no luck, and litigation became “necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instances when universities seek legal action over patent rights are rare, Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until this case, there really are very few examples of universities directly enforcing their patent rights against industry,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s decision to seek litigation comes on the backdrop of a much larger issue in which the threat of stolen knowledge is constantly looming, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a systemic problem … It’s important for academic institutions to have tools like this available to them to make sure their rights are respected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is successful in court, the money would be split three ways between Longford Capital — a litigation firm working with the university — SSLEEC researchers responsible for the patents and UCSB itself, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-30/uc-santa-barbara-sues-led-lightbulbs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

called for an increase in pay and employee benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming weeks, UPTE will have the opportunity to formally ratify both contracts, focusing on employee compensation, health benefits and retirement benefits, according to a </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the agreement, Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations for the UC, said the UC is “pleased” with the new agreements which will grant employees “competitive pay” and “excellent benefits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the press release, the tentative agreements entail a 20% “across the board” increase in pay for health care professionals, and a 22% increase in pay for research and technical professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new contracts, UPTE employees will receive the same health care rates as other employees and a “$25 cap on monthly premium increases on UC’s most popular HMO plans,” according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of retirement benefits, the press release states that new UC employees will be eligible for “the same pension benefits as current UPTE-represented employees” until 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care, research and technical professionals will also benefit from no retirement cuts, no “dangerous” pension drop out, overtime for over eight hours and double overtime after twelve hours, according to the </span><a href=\"http://www.upte.org/local/new/congrats-ta/\"><span

<em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Alcocer, associate vice president of the Budget Analysis and Planning office, led the discussion around the possibility of cohort-based tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Cohort-based tuition] could benefit students and institutions alike,” he said during the meeting, pointing out that the practice has “been adopted by a number of public universities in other states” but that it has never been done on “as large a scale as we are discussing today.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better implement the plan, Alcocer said the UC Office of The President (UCOP) reached out to universities that have implemented cohort-based tuition to learn what works and what doesn’t, stating that universities must have stable revenue streams from state funds, tuition and investments in order to reach their principle goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also pointed out that the tuition changes could be “pegged to the rate of inflation” so that the tuition would remain flat at “constant dollars,” meaning the purchasing power of the cost remains the same throughout each year, but the cash amount goes up with inflation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president of the UC Office of the Chief Financial Officer, said there are numerous decisions involved with the change, such as deciding whether the approach would be for both undergraduate and graduate students, whether the plan should include just base tuition or other fees as well and how long a cohort should be defined as, noting that many low-income students take longer to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When phasing in cohort-based tuition, the tuition increases would ideally be tied to inflation but would affect only a quarter of the students at the beginning, “so you might have to do a slightly higher increase in the beginning to make up for that lost revenue,” Brostrom said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling numerous protests over tuition hikes, Regent Sherry Lansing said that it was not necessarily the tuition hike that caused an outcry but rather inconsistency in the tuition hikes, referencing the</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_California_college_tuition_hike_protests\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2009 Occupy protests. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lansing stated that she has never seen the Regents want to increase tuition, but by not raising tuition, universities often have to cut programs and limit their growth in response to shortfalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems to me that this is a perfect time to discuss this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chair Cecilia Estolano explained that for the plan to be successful, the UC would need the California state legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to both be fully on board with the plan in addition to maintaining the UC’s goals. UC’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-2030-dashboard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goals for 2030</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are to award upwards of 1 million degrees, close the achievement gap and add 1,100 professor positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that having a steady revenue for the UC would be necessary to maintain the cohort-tuition approach. Estolano continued by noting that unexpected pitfalls in funding are a guarantee going forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know there will be a recession. We know there will be pressure, so we need to have some other mechanism to still achieve these goals,” Estolano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Regent Lark Park, the issue came down to, “How do we fund the university we want?” He said that if the Regents approach this model, they need to look deeply into where the UC’s money comes from before going forward with any plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been very clear from the conversation that we cannot look at this as a singular question but how it relates to other issues, raised with respect to what kind of university we want to build,” Regent Chair John Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In closing the discussion, Napolitano said that a working group has been formed to research the topic, consisting of Chair Perez, Regent Maria Anguiano, Student Regent Hayley Weddle and UC Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We obviously have a lot of work to do,” Napolitano said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) ⁠— a program that allows first-year UCSB students the chance to move in early and take one session of summer classes with the aim of easing them into UCSB ⁠— have historically lived in San Nicolas Hall, and in recent years, have stayed in that hall for their entire first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, 100 slots in San Miguel Hall, San Nicholas’ neighbor, will be open to FSSP students who are interested in moving into another residence hall during the school year. Those 100 students will live in San Miguel during the summer and move into one of the other six residence halls ⁠— Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Manzanita Village, Santa Catalina, San Rafael or Santa Cruz ⁠—  once Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change, said William Jankowski, associate director of UCSB’s Residential &amp; Community Living, was made so that students who wanted to live in other residence halls would still be able to participate in FSSP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jankowski explained that every year, his department receives requests from FSSP students to live in residence halls other than San Nicholas for the academic year, particularly from students wanting to room with individuals who are not in FSSP and who are living in other residence halls. Non-FSSP students typically move into different residence halls the week before Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, students have had to choose [between FSSP and their friends],” Jankowski said.  “We’re excited this year that we can allow students to move into a different residence hall after FSSP, and opening up FSSP to San Miguel allows us to do this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students in FSSP are typically known for remaining together in San Nicolas for the entire year, this change is not unprecedented, according to Gallucci. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the program first began in 2002 with 210 students, most students moved out of San Nicolas for the following fall quarter. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimate goal was to fill both San Nicolas and San Miguel with 800 to 1000 students for the summer, who would then move to different residence halls in the fall, he explained. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Gallucci said that “around six or seven years ago,” Housing &amp; Residential Services changed the program to keep students together in San Nicolas for the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They wanted to try a different system, thinking that perhaps living together for a whole year would consolidate those friendships,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the program has grown over the past 17 years, with a projected total of 540 students this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number on par with last year’s cohort of 540, which was about 10% of the class of 2022 ⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UCSB Summer Sessions office and Housing &amp; Residential Services have worked together closely to accommodate the program’s growing popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s slow going, because it’s hard to convince all the students that this is such a good program, because a lot of students think it’s academic boot camp,” Gallucci said. “They don’t realize how fun it can be as well.

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion. It’s not just my profession. If I wished, I could retire, but I’m not going to retire,” Kundu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as my family will allow, as long as these two departments will allow, as long as my physical abilities are good… I will continue to teach.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [7/28]: A previous version of this article said that Kundu was a full faculty member in the Department of Anthropology. Kundu works as a lecturer during summer sessions. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/","id":2002,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2001,2000,1999],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Admission Rate Drops to 29.7%","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-07-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-21-at-11.37.43-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-21-at-11.37.43-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Out of a pool of 176,695 applicants, 108,178 students were admitted as incoming freshmen across the nine UC campuses.
