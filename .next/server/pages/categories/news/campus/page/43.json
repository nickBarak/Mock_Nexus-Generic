Suck Black D*ck Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Racist,” was part of the 18 total Pride Week events throughout Apr. 10-18. Johari Hunt, the event host and a first-year chemistry major, discussed queer history, racism, sexualization of black bodies and the intersection of people of color, social media and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event began with a discussion about queer history and what the minority community within the LGBTQ community looked like throughout the 1900s, specifically “drag ball culture” and the houses in New York that acted as safe spaces and cultural havens for the LGBTQ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt went on to define racism, prejudice and how the “system of advantage based on race” allows society to understand various forms of oppression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Racism isn’t defined by someone saying the n-word, but its systematic and institutional,” he said in an interview. “It is whenever a black person says they’re afraid of police. It is being seen as a criminal before you’re even seen as a child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Racism] is … a system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals,” Hunt added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting racism and prejudice to the perceptions and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity within the LGBTQ community led to an engaged discussion at the event about the intersections of social media, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt’s final segment focused on HIV/AIDS history and the fact that HIV and AIDS transmission within the black community has been neglected in conversations about sex. This has led to a lack of visibility about the topic, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During audience discussion, audience members pointed out the history of United States Vice President Mike Pence and the LGBT community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an archived version of </span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http:/cybertext.net/pence/issues.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Vice President Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign addressed the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for </span><a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website stated that reauthorization of the act should be completed only after an audit to ensure that federal funding would not be given to organizations that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also stated that funding and resources “should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the World Health Organization, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and about 35 million people have died of HIV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, 1.1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76975\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76975\"

experiences, like being black and gay or living with HIV, that are not in a research paper or in an article, need to be talked about,” Hunt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said the hardest part of organizing the event was putting something so blatant into context. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he wanted the audience to start a conversation about what it means to be a minority group in the LGBT community and learn about different life experiences within the LGBT community that most people do not realize exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the process of creating the event, Hunt said he thought about issues that gay men face “all the time” and found that masculinity, and what it means to be masculine, is a critical concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then it went to being black as perceived,” Hunt said. “And then I reached the actual sexualization of black bodies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he felt the event presented his central points openly enough to promote and discuss as well as establish future conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wanted his audience to leave “not with answers, but with the willingness to look for them.”</span></p><div

Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of the bill began approximately seven years ago when the Internal Vice President of the Senate at the time was an ROTC cadet who wanted to resolve the registration concerns of other ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current A.S. President Austin Hechler, however, has been the first to take action since its original proposal, and Senators Alex Giolito and Riley Hobson have authored the most recent version.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giolito credited Hechler for the work he has done to revive the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent history, what brought this all together was Austin Hechler and his work with the ROTC program through talking with a number of different members of it whom he worked with for this project,” Giolito said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Hechler’s outreach to ROTC, Giolito and Hobson began to draft the bill. The bill outlines problems that have existed for UCSB students in the ROTC program, such as the challenge of attending morning classes after morning workouts, managing major classes and keeping up with ROTC requirements while balancing their schedules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bill has garnered support from a variety of individuals, including both current and former UCSB ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill includes a letter from current ROTC Cadet Austin Amato, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, to the Academic Senate. In the letter, Amato said he supports the potential results that priority registration could bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I had the opportunity to utilize priority registration, I would have been more competitive in ROTC, better prepared for classes and perhaps had the opportunity to further immerse myself into other activities and clubs around campus, such as the TMP [Technology Management Program] program,” he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, the interim co-dean of undergraduate education for the College of Letters &amp; Science, said he also supports this bill. He said that with prior registration, those enrolled in the ROTC program would have fewer quarters of academic advising since they will be able to better follow their pre-approved academic schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This will benefit the ROTC cadets, and by reducing workload in our understaffed office, indirectly benefit all Letters &amp; Science students,” Stopple said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Senate’s approval, the bill will now be evaluated by the Academic Senate. If it passes there, it will then go into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ROTC students are a respected portion of the student body and should certainly be rewarded by our school for their dedication and service to the ROTC program,” Hobson said. “I can’t think of any better way to do this than by making their schedules easier by allowing ROTC students to pick their classes with priority.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/","id":2405,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[2404,2403,2402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Passes Resolution to Rename A.S.

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday renaming A.S. Publications after David Miller, an A.S. print shop employee of five years who passed away last month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was passed to “commemorate his life and honor his service to the student body” by renaming the shop “David Miller A.S. Publications.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Publications is a partially subsidized low-cost printing business available to UC Santa Barbara students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller worked as assistant publications coordinator, organizing and designing course readers with professors, and helping students and professors design flyers and posters for campus organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by Ashley Selki, an off-campus senator and third-year economics major, and was seconded by Batsheva Stoll, an off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion praises Miller and says he “was a good man with a wonderful work ethic who was dedicated to supporting student endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she decided to author the resolution in order for people struggling in “these difficult times” to have a tangible way to honor his memory and for future students to appreciate the impact that his work had on helping students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she hopes students in the future who will never have been able to meet him will take the name of the print shop as a dedication to his hard work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a wonderful man David Miller was and how much we appreciate everything that he’s done for the association. He will be deeply missed,” Selki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Publications can be found in UCen Room 1531 near the A.S.

the effects of this increase, as 1,000 more students enrolled for the 2016-17 school year than the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>In March, the Chemistry Department faced challenges trying to accommodate upper division students in the 116BL course, a prerequisite needed to complete the major. Over 20 students were waitlisted, with no facility space to add another lab.</p>\n<p>Rachel Alvelais, a third-year chemistry major, had extensive concerns regarding whether she would be able to graduate on time.</p>\n<p>“For most of us juniors, at this point in time we start to think about graduate school applications, which are due at the middle or end of Fall Quarter,” Alvelais said. “If we have to stay an extra Fall Quarter, then that means that we can’t apply to graduate school next year and we would have to find something to do … for a whole 13 months while we already would have been in graduate school.”</p>\n<p>Taking a summer class, an option that has been offered by several departments, is a choice that does not appeal to students like Alvelais, who did not initially plan to take summer courses and have other internship or research obligations.</p>\n<p>Alvelais, however, said she feels that if she was not able to get into the lab course needed to graduate, she would have no choice but to take summer classes, despite the financial burden.</p>\n<p>The department added more students to each existing lab class, and Alvelais was able to take the class she needed to graduate and do research over the summer; however, her experience is indicative of a more widespread problem.</p>\n<p>Steven Buratto, chair of the Chemistry Department, said he is concerned about a lack of resources for the increasing number of enrolled students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California is great. You get a great education for a reasonable price, comparatively speaking,” Buratto said. “But we don‘t want to get so overcrowded that we can’t accommodate the students that we have.”</p>\n<p>The Chemistry and Biology Departments face issues with physical lab space, a lack of graduate students to work as teaching assistants and a lack of faculty.</p>\n<p>“We’ve reached our capacity, and so at some point throwing money at it doesn’t work,” said Stephen Poole, chair of the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department. “You need faculty to teach these students, you need graduate students to work as TAs, so money could help there; we could expand our graduate program.”</p>\n<p>These restrictions are not felt only within S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>Alison Brysk, the global studies department chair, said the department also faces similar space restrictions: Designated class sizes are quickly surpassing the physical capacity of lecture halls.</p>\n<p>Such restrictions make certain classes more competitive in terms of enrollment, which limits the ability of non-global studies majors to enroll in popular global studies courses.</p>\n<p>Though other UCs have begun offering classes during the evening, there are several challenges to doing this at UCSB. Poole said this is not a viable solution due to the staff needed to prepare labs and the fact that certain lecture halls, like Campbell Hall, are used for other purposes at night.</p>\n<p>Many departments also lack qualified TAs, which limits the departments’ abilities to provide further assistance for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“Graduate students are critical to both the teaching and research missions of our university,” Napolitano said in a statement. “They serve key roles in supporting the academic inquiry and discovery of our faculty, as well as the teaching load for our undergraduates.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, however, has not increased the number of graduate students sufficiently; according to campus profiles authored by the university’s Office of Budget and Planning, this year there were 73 less new graduate students than there were for the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>Larger class sizes are difficult for students to get into and in many cases can negatively affect students’ learning experiences.</p>\n<p>Jerry Chung, the education coordinator for the actuarial science department, said large class sizes hinder students’ ability to interact with each other and increase their own knowledge.</p>\n<p>“An unintended consequence of huge classes is that students in the actuarial science major find it increasingly difficult to network and learn from one another,” Chung said.</p>\n<p>To combat this issue, students in the department have created UCSB’s Actuarial Association, which hosts educational and social events to network with each other.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the effects of increased enrollment extend past the classroom.</p>\n<p>This March, Wyatt Licht, a fourth-year communication major, started a petition to stop bike impounding across campus. The petition alleged that there were not enough bike racks on campus for all students, a sentiment that 481 petition-signers agreed with.</p>\n<p>Student services such as Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) have also been affected.</p>\n<p>“It certainly affects the demand for our services; there’s more students on campus, which means there’s more students wanting or needing mental health services,” said C.A.P.S director Jeanne Stanford.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough space,” Stanford added. “So if we had more space then we would be able to hire more psychologists, and if we had more psychologists then we would be able to accommodate more students.”</p>\n<p>Between 10 to 15 percent of students use C.A.P.S., and with outreach programs, Stanford estimates that they are able to reach around 25 percent of the student population.</p>\n<p>She said that an increase in population density in a small space increases “irritability, frustration [and] anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Stanford also said increased enrollment extends past C.A.P.S. and “affects everything,” including longer wait times at the Office of Financial Aid and the Registrar.</p>\n<p>The increasing numbers also concern undergraduate housing. While the San Joaquin Residence Hall currently under construction will help mitigate the housing strain, a significant increase in freshmen could pose problems.</p>\n<p>“If there was a dramatic increase, then we would have to strategize about how to accommodate them,” said Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services. “We would probably have to look at how we distribute the spaces that we have.”</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, acting assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning, said that while we currently have enough space for students, more housing will have to be built in the future.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang told the Nexus in an interview Tuesday that the university wants to ensure that dorm rooms are no more than triples, and he said philanthropic support of campus housing is an option for the future.</p>\n<p>“Any philanthropic support of housing would lower the cost to students,” Haines said.</p>\n<p>Next year, there will be a small decrease in the number of freshmen admitted, but total undergraduate enrollment will still increase slightly due to an increased emphasis on admitting transfer students.</p>\n<p>According to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, UCSB has been steadily increasing enrollment according to the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), which has a cap on enrollment at 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>State pressures to increase student enrollment, however, have forced UCSB to grow at a rate much higher than the LRDP suggests.</p>\n<p>“The state has not been very cooperative,” Marshall said. “The state has not been giving us adequate resources.”</p>\n<p>As enrollment increases, so do the costs, including C.A.P.S., faculty and other services.</p>\n<p>“We need a long-term plan,” said Yang. “I and the deans and the budget planning team are addressing this problem.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-76914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The building, located between Broida Hall and the UCSB Library, has been plagued by dry rot, damage from insects and steel beam corrosion. <em>Jose Arturo Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After an inspection of the building by Van Sande Structural Consultants, campus building official Ed Schmittgen notified the university on Jan. 9 that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>Schmittgen said there was also not enough seismic bracing within the building.</p>\n<p>Seismic bracing “prevents a building from moving laterally during a seismic event,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p>Such problems could weaken the building’s structure and lead to earthquake vulnerability, he said. The university informed students that they needed to evacuate the building within 45 days.</p>\n<p>The building is over 40 years old and serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began during the week of Feb. 13 and concluded over Spring Break, the university has added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building. These structures make the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes.</p>\n<p>“We essentially have more assurance now that the building is structurally stable than prior to this effort,” Schmittgen said.</p>\n<p>The addition of the concrete pillars has decreased the seismic risk of the building and is one of the steps stabilizing the building. The building will need further adjustments to fix a rotting part of the floor and the foundation of the building, which has suffered water damage.</p>\n<p>The remaining reparations will take place over the summer so students can continue to use El Centro throughout Spring Quarter. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said the administration is working with a group of students from El Centro to plan out the details of the project.</p>\n<p>“The seismic stabilization had to happen right away in order to keep the building in use this year, but the other part of the renovation, we’re outlining the scope of the project right now,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, pressure from the student groups that use El Centro prompted the administration to reconsider its options for the building’s future. Associated Students Senate passed a bill on Jan. 18 urging the university to preserve the historical building.</p>\n<p>“What really made the difference was students saying, ‘We don’t want the building out of commission,’” Klawunn said. “So then Design and Construction went back to see if there is any solution to this that could keep the building in operation.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the new solution was not driven by finances or the cost of a demolition project but rather by “what makes the most sense.” She said the plan allows students to access the building for the duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/","id":2402,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2401,2400,2399],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Filmmakers Talk Rwandan Rape in Corwin","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Uncondemned.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Uncondemned.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Approximately 280 people were in attendance at Corwin Pavilion for the Monday evening screening and panel with the film’s producers and protagonists organized by the Associated Students (A.S.)

UC Santa Barbara is the first UC campus to host her.</p>\n<p>“Dear brothers and sisters,” she began, a phrase she repeated multiple times. “I am so proud to be here.”</p>\n<p>She expressed her “sadness and anger” at violent events that have occurred in Syria, especially those in her region, such as the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that she blamed on Assad’s tyrannical regime.</p>\n<p>She focused her lecture on tyranny and the Arab Spring, which she described as a “response to the decay of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Our revolution is not a fleeting whim, but needs that we have had for many years,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman organized student rallies in Sana’a, the largest city in Yemen and was imprisoned several times in 2011. In Yemen’s opposition movement, she is known as the “Iron Woman” and described going to prison as the “best moment of [her] life.”</p>\n<p>“They were stupid when they took me to the jail, because it made me very strong,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman’s incarceration led to Yemeni people rioting in the streets, calling for her release and repeating her chants, which engaged students in the revolution.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, expressing her disappointment with their relationships with Syria.</p>\n<p>When asked about her views of Obama, she said she “expected a lot from him, as a human,” but found herself disappointed.</p>\n<p>“I blame him on the bloodshed in Syria,” she said. “I believe that he could stop the bloodshed.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Karman said she respects him and believes he did great things within the U.S.</p>\n<p>Karman went on to criticize President Trump’s travel ban, which she called a violation of international human rights and “values as an American.”</p>\n<p>“Whoever brands Muslims with terror is not only lying and ignorant, he is directly and indirectly helping terrorism,” she said.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about how religion was used against her and other women who tried to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>“Dictators use religion to build walls between nations,” she said. “All of us should be against the bad religious people who translate religion in a bad way.”</p>\n<p>She urged the audience to take responsibility to protect their values, including “peace, love, coexistence and democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman spoke extensively about terrorism and said despotism and terrorism are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>According to Karman, the Western “catastrophic failure” in the Iraq War created conditions for the Islamic State (I.S.). She also said she believes Assad created I.S. to stop the peaceful Syrian revolution.</p>\n<p>“Silence has given Assad the permission to keep killing the Syrian people,” she said. “We don’t accept any choice between terrorism and despotism. The only choice we will make and we will win and we will struggle for is democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman did express hope for the future and said university students are a part of the generation “that will protect the world better than we are doing now.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t let anyone to steal your values,” she said to the students in the audience. “You are the creator of the future, my son, my daughter.

times before she finally reached South Korea after serving seven years in the North Korean People’s Army.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Liberty in North Korea (L.I.N.K.) chapter hosted the two North Korean defectors this Thursday to talk about human rights violations and their journeys in escaping a dictatorship.</p>\n<p>L.I.N.K. brought the defectors to campus through its partnership with Young North Korea, a South Korean nonprofit organization that focuses on awareness of North Korean human rights.</p>\n<p>According to Athena Wan, the club’s co-president and a third-year economics and accounting major, the UCSB L.I.N.K. chapter is dedicated to funding escape missions, helping North Korean refugees integrate into the world and creating a community around human rights activism.</p>\n<p>Kim said he was part of the <i>kochebi</i>, a group of orphaned children of the “hostile” or lower class. The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends. She was imprisoned and released again after her third attempt, but was frustrated with the political structure and finally escaped to South Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76763\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76763\" data-attachment-id=\"76763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/img_9093/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9093\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76763\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Elizabeth Hong</em></p></div>\n<p>Yang Mo, Young North Korea’s College Student Alliance external affairs representative, said he works with other organizations throughout South Korea to facilitate the integration of defectors into education and the workforce.</p>\n<p>Both defectors are now students at universities in South Korea.

Anderle, the judge who ruled that the student may return to school, said that the evidence in the case “suggests UCSB never made an effort to contact Jane Doe to corroborate the statements attributed to her.”</p>\n<p>John Doe’s suspension will remain lifted even if the university places charges against the freshman. The stay on the suspension will remain in effect “up to and including any final judgment in that case, after all appeals, if any,” according to Judge Anderle’s ruling.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that UCSB must also assist Doe by giving him full access to all programs and activities at UCSB with no restrictions, returning him to his assigned on-campus dorm room, allowing him to complete all classes, giving him priority enrollment and providing any assistance necessary from any of the university offices.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle said in his decision that the university took too long to investigate, failing to fulfill both the 60-calendar-day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60-business-day deadline agreed upon by the university.</p>\n<p>“The Court of Appeal found that the University’s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, appears unreasonable and arbitrary,” Judge Anderle said in the court ruling.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle ruled that the university had caused “irreparable harm” to the student by failing to conduct the investigation in a timely manner, leaving him suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p>“This Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly. The University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll in the any [sic] of the first three quarters of his freshman year,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “But instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.”</p>\n<p>According to Doe’s lawyer, Robert Ottilie, Doe moved into his on-campus dorm during Spring Break and said the university has been very helpful with the process of assimilating Doe to life in college.</p>\n<p>“They could not have been more helpful. The school has been responsive to the ruling,” Ottilie said.<br>\nUCSB spokeswoman Andrea Estrada said the university “will make every effort to ensure the student’s success” while they complete the adjudication process.</p>\n<p>“We respect the court’s rulings and have complied with the court’s order,” she said in an email.<br>\nOttilie said Doe is very happy with the decision because it now allows him to start his life, beginning with attending his “dream school.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he was not surprised by the judge’s ruling to remove Doe’s suspension, as he felt the law was clearly on his side.</p>\n<p>“It really wasn’t very much of a surprise. The law is very clear,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Doe has won his ruling to return to school, he still faces an ongoing investigation against him on behalf of the university, a lawsuit against that claim in court and several hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees that he must pay.</p>\n<p>According to the ruling, Doe has incurred over $100,000 in attorney’s fees and costs just through his filing in December of 2016. The ruling said he has “undoubtedly incurred substantially more in fees and costs since that time.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said Doe is unable to pay that amount of money and does not expect him to pay the expenses anytime soon. Ottilie himself has incurred $50,000 of out-of-pocket costs from representing Doe against the university.</p>\n<p>As for what Doe will decide to study now that he has started school this Spring Quarter, Ottilie said he does not know what particular major the first-year will choose while at UCSB. Ottilie said it would not surprise him if Doe went on to study law later on.</p>\n<p>Ottilie also said he will continue to investigate abuses of the particular code in the Regents’ laws that the university has used to keep Doe and students in similar situations from attending school.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said new information has come out that suggests the university withheld information during the judicial process, so he also plans to amend the lawsuit to include four UCSB staff members involved in Doe’s 200-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Included in the proposed amendment are Kristi Johnson, principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs; Sandra Vasquez, associate dean of judicial affairs; and Brian Quillen, also principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office.</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university has not yet seen any amended complaint.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76691\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76691\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/","id":2424,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2423,2422,2421],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Mourns Loss of ‘Selfless’ Grad Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=661%2C468&ssl=1","description":"Samuel “Sam” Boldissar died on March 25 while rock climbing in Joshua Tree.

He was always rock climbing, always.”</p>\n<p>Jordan Hughes was a housemate of Boldissar and met him in 2014 when they began graduate school at UCSB. He said Boldissar came from a “family of climbers.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar enjoyed rock climbing, backpacking and camping. He also loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, cooking and brewing his own beer.</p>\n<p>Hughes said Boldissar was “true to his own tastes” and interested in a variety of different things.</p>\n<p>“He spent his time on things he found intrinsically interesting,” Hughes said in an email. “He wasn’t in grad school for the degree. He did it because the problems he worked on were important and interesting to him.”</p>\n<p>A problem solver, Hughes said Boldissar once created a skunk trap in their backyard in Isla Vista. One night, he went to check on the trap and a skunk wandered into the house through the opened door.</p>\n<p>“Lots of yelling ensued and we miraculously avoided getting skunk spray in our house, but we did decide that the best defense was probably just to keep the door shut,” Hughes said in an email.</p>\n<p>Haley Snyder was Boldissar’s neighbor in Isla Vista and said “the best” she saw Boldissar was when they would sit in the living room “singing and playing drums.”</p>\n<p>“There’s not many people that you’re going to meet that were as genuine or as kind as Sam,” Snyder said.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate transfer student at UCSB, Boldissar lived with seven other Isla Vistans: Patrick Sheehan, Paul Mazzella, Mike Wood, Tyler Rowe, Shelby Hendricks, Lewis Durand and Erik Romelfanger.</p>\n<p>Sheehan said the group lived together on the 68-block of Sabado.</p>\n<p>Sheehan and Mazzella explained how they once wrote a song for Boldissar titled, “Sammy Come Home,” because he was always working on campus at the Chemistry lab.</p>\n<p>“We ended up singing [the song] for the rest of the year and it sort of resonates right now,” Mazzella said.</p>\n<p>“We’d play it for him all the time and he’d think it was funny,” Sheehan added. “And now Sam has passed away and we want Sammy to come home. We loved him so much and wanted him around so much that we wrote a song about it.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca described Boldissar as “selfless” and said he “really just wanted to help anyone in need.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca said she and Boldissar went to Big Bear with friends and he helped a group of people get their car out of a ditch on the icy road.</p>\n<p>“Sam just walked over without a second thought … to go help these people, and he just got on the bumper and started pushing as hard as he could,” she said. “He’s the reason the car got out of the ditch. He did things like that all the time.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca and Boldissar were together for six months and she said they enjoyed taking walks on the beach and introducing each other to the things they each liked to do.</p>\n<p>Boldissar took Rebecca to the Santa Barbara Rock Gym and went to musicals like “Beauty and the Beast” because Rebecca loves musicals.</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries described Boldissar as “brilliant” and always willing to help other students in the research group with their own projects.</p>\n<p>“He was very good but in a humble way,” de Vries said. “He was involved in every project in the lab and helped every other student in the group.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar worked on multiple projects in the research group, and his most recent projects are being compiled for publication.</p>\n<p>“It’s wonderful his name is going to be in publications and in scientific journals,” Rebecca said. “I’m glad people are going to see the hard work he did.”</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries said he wants Boldissar to be remembered “with a smile.”</p>\n<p>“He always had this smile and everybody in our group is touched by him,” de Vries said. “He’s been so influential … [and] he had no idea how smart he was. There was never any showing off. It was just that smile.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar’s funeral will be held on April 22 at 11 a.m. at Redondo Union High School.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/","id":2423,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2422,2421,2420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who supervises all of Associated Students, said, Miller was “certainly a beloved member of A.S.”</p>\n<p>Miller’s coworkers describe him as a dependable person who always got the job done. Marquez said Miller always followed through with his commitments.</p>\n<p>“One of my fondest memories of David is really being able to always be certain that whatever he committed to, he was going to have — he would follow through,” she said. “He was very, very true to his word.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she enjoyed visiting Miller in his office because he would have photographs of his family, and anyone who knew him would know he loved spending time with them. Miller had a wife and two young children.</p>\n<p>Marquez said Miller enjoyed working with students at A.S. and had previously worked at Grafikart, a photocopying business in what is now the A.S. Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Austin Hechler said he fondly remembers Miller as a person who got things done.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t just there to do his job, he was there to make sure that everyone excelled at their job as well,” Hechler said. “Whenever I came into A.S. Publications, he’d shake my hand with a firm handshake, always smiling, always laughing.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said he remembers working with Miller on his initiative to make college textbooks more affordable.</p>\n<p>“All-around, genuinely a good man. Someone you would hope to emulate if you were an incoming A.S. staffer,” Hechler said. “They should emulate him, how he talked to students, how he treated those people around them and really just his general attitude toward helping students with things.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. is considering honoring Miller by naming a scholarship or a part of the A.S. building after him.</p>\n<p>“I do know that there are talks within Senate to introduce a resolution or do something in his honor, so maybe name the Publications building after him or the room after him or maybe a scholarship after him, for whatever he was passionate about,” he said. “Definitely something that we could do within A.S. to solidify his memory and what he did and the service that he provided for all the student body.”</p>\n<p>Miller’s friends have set up a memorial fund on the crowdfunding site YouCaring. In lieu of flowers, the friends ask that people consider donating to the fund in support of Miller’s wife and two children.</p>\n<p>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) at caps.sa.ucsb.edu or (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/","id":2421,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2420,2419,2418],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inspiring Student, Role Model Passes at Age 25","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=635%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Ismael Hernandez transferred from SBCC and was prepared to graduate from UCSB in June with a degree in biology.

It was a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez had a “wakeup call” at the age of 17, she said, when his mother passed away around the same time he faced incarceration in juvenile hall. He attended his mother’s funeral in handcuffs, and he realized soon after that he needed to change his life for the sake of his three younger siblings.</p>\n<p>“He knew that if he continued on the path of delinquency or anything like that, it wouldn’t lead him to be a great role model for his siblings,” Rodriguez said. “At the end of the day, that’s what his mom wanted him to be; she wanted him to go to school and do great things.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez later graduated from a continuation high school and went on to enroll in Transitions, a program at SBCC which seeks to provide educational opportunities to individuals released from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>Noel Gomez, a Transitions program counselor, remembers Hernandez telling the class on the first day that he was going to graduate from SBCC with a degree in biological sciences, go on to UCSB and become a doctor.</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you how many times I hear that from a lot of students. Within a semester, students drop out or they don’t carry on with their goals. He actually went on and did it,” Gomez said.<br>\nFrom then on, everyone in the class started calling him “the doctor,” Gomez said. Hernandez valued hard work and would often study in the library for hours on end.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t understand why people would come to SBCC and not focus on school,” Gomez said. “He took that as an opportunity that a lot of people don’t have, and he wanted to use it.”</p>\n<p>After five years at SBCC, Hernandez became the first in his family to graduate from college. He applied and got accepted into his dream school, UCSB, where he continued his studies in biology.</p>\n<p>His classmate and close friend Kathy Lopez said he kept to his diligent study habits, which he had maintained at SBCC. He volunteered in the emergency room at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, and he had plans to go to nursing school after graduation.</p>\n<p>Lopez said she and Hernandez would often hang out together after their biology classes. She said he would always want to stop by Root 217 in the UCen so that he could get “that fish sandwich he always wanted.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said one of the fondest memories she has with Hernandez is when they were reflecting on graduation by the UCSB Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“We were walking over past the lagoon — it was a really nice day, actually, and the lagoon didn’t smell so bad either — and he just looked over at the lagoon and was like, ‘Kathy, we actually did this; we’re actually here and we’re actually graduating. We made it,’” she said, adding that the two of them paid a visit to Root 217 soon after.</p>\n<p>Hernandez worked as a cashier at a liquor store to support his education and family. His sister, Karinna Hernandez, said he often told customers that he would take care of them when he became a doctor.</p>\n<p>His sister also said he greatly valued his family and that he especially loved his nieces.</p>\n<p>“He used to love being with my kids,” she said. “Every time he saw them, he would always give them kisses, and he’d always hold my oldest daughter and tell her he could bless her. He would always kiss her hand and tell her it was his blessing.”</p>\n<p>Karinna Hernandez said her brother became a role model for the family. She said he often encouraged her to prioritize her education, helping her pick her classes at SBCC and advising her to sit at the front of her classes.</p>\n<p>“He was a caring person with a big heart,” she said. “His smile was something that I think nobody can forget. He was such a loving person.”</p>\n<p>Friends and family held a funeral service for Hernandez on March 16 at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Barbara. He was buried with his bachelor’s degree in biological sciences.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/","id":2422,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2421,2420,2419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Food Bank was founded in 2011 in response to rising tuition costs that left students in financial need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The food bank currently receives approximately 500 visits a day and 1,200 visits a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Mondays and Wednesdays, the food bank has fresh produce that it purchases from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank, but organizers mostly provide dry foods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said organizers hope to get fresh produce for all three days after the facility expansion. They plan to receive produce donations from Edible Campus, a student-run farm that is going to launch within the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expansion is happening at the same time that the UC Student Association picked student food and housing insecurities as their new initiative to focus on within the UC system. Hechler said 48 percent of students within the UCs identify as “food insecure.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our food bank is humbly tucked away in the UCen and no one really knows about it, but we serve about 1,200 students a week, and that’s unreal compared to others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler said he was the only one at the UC Council of Presidents who was able to say their campus had a successful food bank. He said UCSB is “way ahead” of other campuses in fighting student food insecurities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said that, aside from the food bank team, Hechler has “really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the whole food bank team got together to fight for the expansion, and she hopes to see it completed before she graduates in June.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully with the work that we’re doing, we can destigmatize the desire and need to get food aid when you need it,” Jones said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76597\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76597\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/","id":2394,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2393,2392,2391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detained Skateboarder Faces Resisting Arrest Charges","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County District Attorney filed the case of Erin Morgan, a fourth-year zoology major, with the Santa Barbara Superior Court on Monday, setting her court date for the morning of Mar. 27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD officers arrested Morgan on Feb. 27 after she allegedly attempted to flee from receiving a citation for illegally skateboarding through the Arbor. The video of Morgan’s detainment, which went viral on Facebook in the days following the arrest, shows two UCPD officers in the Arbor taking Morgan down to her knees and then down to the ground on her stomach.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF591SOtago?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCPD spokesperson Sgt. Rob Romero, the two UCPD officers instructed Morgan to stop skateboarding and to wait as they handed her a citation. Romero said she waited “for maybe close to half a minute” before grabbing her skateboard and riding in the opposite direction from which she originally came.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the officers yelled at her to stop, but she continued to go. According to Romero, an officer then ran after her, grabbed the back of her backpack and took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Romero, the officer tried to get her to place her hands behind her back, but instead she tried to stand up. He said when the second officer came to assist, they each grabbed one of her arms because she was trying to get up and then they “forcibly” took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking somebody to ground — if you ever played any type of sport or if you wrestled or anything like that — when you use force, it’s not pretty,” he said the day after the incident. “It’s not something we wish we have to use on people we arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 28, Morgan confirmed she tried to ride away from receiving her citation, but she said she did not expect the officers would use force to detain her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My biggest concern is just how quickly it came to that,” she said. “I didn’t think that just me skateboarding away would result in me getting thrown to the ground.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan also said she was booked in the county jail on the night of her arrest, and after paying a $2,500 bail, she returned home early the next day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday that she does not intend to challenge the charges of resisting arrest, but said she does intend to speak to a civil attorney about the forcible detainment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I walked away from him and that’s against the law. So I’m not going to try to fight that,” she said Tuesday. “He violated my civil rights. You can’t just throw someone to the ground for rolling away from a police officer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court records, authorities have charged Morgan for violating California Penal Code 148(a)(1). The law holds that a person who “willfully resists, delays or obstructs” a police officer shall receive a fine no greater than $1,000, a county jail sentence no longer than a year or both the fine and imprisonment.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76481\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76481\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/","id":2420,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2419,2418,2417],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":43,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
