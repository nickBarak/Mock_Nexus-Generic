After a year in office, he looks back on his term as filled with challenges,  accomplishments and advocacy.</p>\n<p>“I think that to be S.A.G., you have to have a very present voice. You have to be willing to be vocal and be present,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>The responsibilities of the student advocate general (S.A.G.) include overseeing the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) and its staff, educating the student body on students’ rights and promoting awareness of services offered by the office.</p>\n<p>OSA’s role on campus is to inform and assist students facing charges from UC Santa Barbara in issues relating to housing, academics, public interest and social conduct, essentially “serving as the campus public defender,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>S.A.G. is also required to act as a nonpartisan representative for all undergraduates on campus, according to the A.S. Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum, a fourth-year economics major, said his term was filled with both growth and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In leading new projects expanding the purview of the OSA as well as maintaining efficiency of the caseworkers, Tannenbaum said he had to balance the needs of individual students as well as those of the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum led projects including the polling analyst project, rewriting the legal code for positions in OSA and renovating the OSA website.</p>\n<p>OSA case workers work with students individually, guiding them through the university’s judicial process. This can include helping students organize their case documents, providing mediation and accompanying hearings, according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>He said one of the biggest projects during his term was the polling analyst project, which he claims stemmed from his commitment to nonpartisanship as well as his determination to innovate strategies for representing UCSB’s student body, he said.</p>\n<p>The project was initiated in Fall Quarter of 2017 and aims to shed light on marginalized or underrepresented voices at UCSB by polling the student body on their opinions and needs, according to Tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>The poll was intended to be included at the end of the ballet form for A.S. elections, but due to setbacks had to be postponed until a later time. The poll will be implemented before the end of the year, Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>“Starting a project from scratch is tough and I would say we were in new territory in how we wanted to implement this,” he said.</p>\n<p>He said it was important to collect substantive information about the priorities of students so he could bring it to the attention of the A.S. and continued to pursue this project despite obstacles that arose.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson, OSA chief of staff, worked closely with Tannenbaum during his term and attributed his successes in outreach as S.A.G. in part to his charismatic personality.</p>\n<p>Alex Funk, OSA external deputy chief, said Tannenbaum’s character played a role in the hiring process for OSA case workers.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t necessarily so focused on purely technically minded or technically sound people, what he was focused on was people that he could work with,” Funk said. “You’re not looking just at merit, you’re looking at like the more holistic view of a person and I thought that was really admirable.”</p>\n<p>During his term, Tannenbaum revamped the OSA website, which when he entered the position, had errors throughout its pages including incorrectly listing past a S.A.G. as current a current caseworker.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also spoke to transfer students in lectures about the role of the OSA in assisting students with issues like plagiarism.</p>\n<p>Instead of speaking about a focus point of judicial consequences, Tannenbaum instead spoke to students about the advocacy that OSA can provide when students have issues that bring them to the OSA office.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made some inroads in kind of strengthening relationships between our office and administration which is really vital to making sure we can best advocate for students,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>In Tannenbaum’s campaign platform, he estimated that the OSA office served approximately 20 cases per quarter. This year, Tannenbaum estimated that OSA served as many students this year as last year, and possibly more.</p>\n<p>Before coming into office Tannenbaum did not have previous experience in the OSA, but he said his time serving as a proxy during Senate meetings cultivated an appreciation he now holds for nonpartisan work and led him to the position in his final year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He also said he has found fulfillment in helping students find resolutions to the issues that bring them to OSA.</p>\n<p>“Our office provides a space and people who are there to say ‘you’re not alone. We have the institutional knowledge to help,’” Tannenbaum said. “It’s been a really amazing and gratifying experience to be able to be in that space … and try my best and try to enable others to help those in times of need.”</p>\n<p>As for advice for next year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, Tannenbaum said maintaining an active voice for all students and guiding them toward solutions should remain the focus throughout the term.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what our job is about… being there for students in times of need,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang to state his support for the union to the University of California Office of the President (UCOP).</p>\n<p>“I authored the resolution because I have high respect for our custodial/maintenance workers here on campus,” Gessesse said. “By cc’ing Chancellor Yang, we want direct action, a statement that shows his support for the workers on campus to the Regents, UCOP and other agencies written on that resolution. I believe it’s pertinent to this movement.”</p>\n<p>“This strike should not be overlooked,” she added.</p>\n<p>American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299’s three-day strike at UCSB began on Monday morning and ended Wednesday evening, going from approximately 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.</p>\n<p>More than 200 workers and student supporters <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/afscme-begins-strike-draws-over-200-supporters-at-ucsb/\">marched around campus</a> several times throughout the day, chanting and holding dozens of handmade signs.</p>\n<p>This is the largest strike in the history of the UC, according to an AFSCME press release on Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution was student-sponsored by Michael Kile, fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern.</p>\n<p>“With community comes empathy, and with empathy comes action,” Kile said during an A.S. Senate meeting Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The resolution references data from a report AFSCME 3299 released in mid-April, which states that black and Latinx employees are making starting wages that are 20 to 21 percent less than their white counterparts.</p>\n<p>AFSCME <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/union-votes-to-strike-following-final-impasse/\">voted to strike</a> following more than a year of negotiations with the UC. Currently the union represents over 24,000 workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“UC workers are going on strike to fight for their right for dignity and respect in the workplace in which negotiations for their right to sanctuary campuses, fair hiring practices, and an ending to contract practices that push womxn and people of color, especially into inescapable low wage jobs,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>UCOP released a statement Monday morning when the strike began, calling the strike “ill-advised” and “highly inappropriate.”</p>\n<p>“AFSCME leaders are demanding a nearly 20 percent pay raise over three years — twice what other UC employees have received. The university cannot justify to taxpayers such an excessive raise, no matter how much we appreciate our service workers,” UCOP’s press release states.</p>\n<p>“A disruptive demonstration will change neither UC’s economic situation nor the university’s position on AFSCME’s unreasonable demands,” the press release reads.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday night, the university has not sent out a statement addressing the end of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The A.S.

This allows for flexibility among both students and staff schedules, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain free counseling for students, long-term counseling is not offered at UCSB, according to Honegger. Students who desire long-term counseling are typically referred to clinicians within the community that can provide more in-depth support.</p>\n<p>“Some students who have a greater need [for more frequent counseling] are seen for longer; it depends on their financial resources and their level of need and what other alternative services are available out there,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>“Some universities like Stanford … offer long term therapy. [However] the moment you want longer term services, you [are] converted to utilizing your insurance,” he added.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. currently has one psychologist for every 967 students and is aiming to expand to have one psychologist for every 750 students, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.’ desire] is to hire more clinicians and hopefully with that we’ll be able to serve more people and more efficiently serve them,” he said.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] believes very strongly that mental health resources should be available to all students … [because of this] it’s hard to have long term therapy options,” he said.</p>\n<p>A future in which long-term counseling is offered at UCSB is a possibility, Honegger said. However, that would require C.A.P.S. to have a “bigger budget, a bigger building, and … more clinicians.”</p>\n<p>Honneger said he believes most students are satisfied with the current short-term model C.A.P.S. follows.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, students just want help getting through a rough time and don’t necessarily want the norm to be long term, extensive, and in-depth therapy,” he said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. concentrates on assisting students seeking help from professionals in building self-confidence, reducing stress and solving problems among other things, according to <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">C.A.P.S.’ website</a>.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] serves a pretty large percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>In the future, C.A.P.S. hopes to hire a social worker or a family therapist to do initial assessments of the students prior to providing counseling or psychological services.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. is open Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students can also contact the office directly at (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared

Clemente Villages and the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. Between 20 to 25 rapes were reported from 2015 to 2017, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The most frequent location of sexual offense — which the report defined differently from sexual assault — is the UC Santa Barbara Library. Eight reports of sexual offenses occured at the UCSB Library, followed by six reports in the Santa Catalina residence hall.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) defines rape as any type of vaginal, anal or oral penetration without consent of the survivor. Sexual offense includes fondling, incest, statutory rape, indecent exposure, peeping and more.</p>\n<p>The report includes UCPD data recorded between 2015 to 2017 and a compilation of articles referring to sexual assault, “hookup culture” and attitudes concerning sexual encounters within Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara and the greater UC system from 2013 to 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB students had included a sexual assault report card among a list of demands they presented last May to school administrators. In March, the CSD officially began preparing the report.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) made several records requests to UCPD and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for detailed information regarding sexual assault and misconduct cases. The information includes the specific location of the incidents that took place.</p>\n<p>IVFP denied the CSD’s request on the grounds that the information requested is confidential.</p>\n<p>However, the CSD’s legal counsel confirmed that sexual assault reports in the area are public information and the IVFP does not have proper grounds to withhold the information, according to CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud.</p>\n<p>The information, however, lacks critical details, such as the time the incidents occurred, more specific locations and more detailed classifications of the type of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The board also voted to send a letter to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office outlining the goals of the report and requesting more information.</p>\n<p>Matan Bostick, CSD public policy intern and author of the report, coded over 30 news articles into categories that best represent the phrases mentioned within each article.</p>\n<p>The category with the highest frequency among articles was “Issue[s] with UC process,” which refers to any problems survivors might have with the UC’s process of reporting sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The next most frequently cited categories were “Bad Results” and “Delays in Response Procedure.” These categories refer to any perceived injustice on the survivor’s behalf and a lack of appropriate and timely responses by police departments or university systems, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bostick used the data from UCPD to organize the information into graphs comparing variables such as location, type of sexual crime, frequency per month and the number of cases forwarded to the District Attorney’s (DA) office.</p>\n<p>UCPD distinguishes data relating to sexual violence between two categories: “sexual assault” and “sexual offense.”</p>\n<p>The data in the report shows that the number of reported sexual assaults increased by over 50 percent from 2015 to 2017. In each year, however, the majority of cases reported to UCPD were not forwarded to the DA’s office.</p>\n<p>Bostick said the shortage of cases forwarded to the DA’s office could be caused by a number of reasons, including a survivor’s choice to not press charges.</p>\n<p>The events “are just the tip of the iceberg, especially in regards to sexual offenses which were reported less frequently than sexual assaults,” Bostick said.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

U-mail accounts will still be accessible through the “U-Mail Web Access” link found on the UCSB U-mail website, according to Amstutz.</p>\n<p>In addition to current email addresses, UCSBNetID@umail.ucsb.edu, students will also have the option of using a new domain name, UCSBNetID@ucsb.edu.</p>\n<p>The CIO recommends that students frequently check their emails and pay attention to any emails detailing the transition of their account.</p>\n<p>“The best thing you can do to prepare is to watch your email and actually read them because you will get an email that lets you know exactly what day [the email server] is swapping for you … That’s all students need to do,” Amstutz said.</p>\n<p>The CIO is working on completing the transition of emails for the Student Affairs division, Kantrim said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. This will complete the migration for the entire UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Approximately 12,377 out of 15,222 email accounts of UCSB staff and faculty have been fully transitioned to Google as of March 2018, according to Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 study done by Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T), the university found 65 percent of students with Office 365 U-mail accounts were forwarding their emails to other servers. Of those forwarding, 64 percent of emails were being sent to Gmail.</p>\n<p>Students had proposed switching to Gmail when the university first switched from a local email server to Office 365 in 2012. However, the Google platform at the time was difficult to manage and was not as developed as it is today, according to Joe Sabado, SIS&amp;T executive director.</p>\n<p>The transition to the Google server will allow students, faculty and staff to be on the same platform and easily share documents, calendars and improve overall collaboration, Sabado said.</p>\n<p>Although Gmail provides multi-factor authentication, email phishing and other malware will not see a significant change, according to Sam Horowitz, CIO chief information security officer.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, a mailbox is a mailbox,” Horowitz said in an email. “People still need to be careful with email.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: James Kantrim is the Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) service delivery manager, not the Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T) director of strategic architecture and platform integration services as previously stated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/","id":2256,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2255,2254,2253],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

<em>Courtesy of “The Laura Flanders Show”</em></p></div>\n<p>“The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.”</p>\n<p>Those were some of the opening lines of Malcolm X’s speech at the funeral of Ronald Stokes in 1962.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 56 years to 2018, Kimberlé Crenshaw would argue X’s statements still ring true.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, April 25, attendees at Campbell Hall heard the words of Crenshaw, who popularized the concept of “intersectionality” nearly three decades ago. The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

previously planned lecture about the industrial revolution for an informational presentation by Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) along with a lecture about sexual assault throughout history.</p>\n<p>“I would have not brought it up if it were not a problem on campus today,” he said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>Spickard said he felt he was teaching within the boundaries of his qualifications as a history professor because sexual assault is a topic that is present throughout history.</p>\n<p>In previous courses, Spickard has taught a “mini-lecture” on sexual assault, but he said due to the continued sexual violence on campuses, he decided to give a full lecture. This is the first time he dedicated a full lecture time slot to the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Within the nationwide college undergraduate student body, approximately “23.1 percent of females and 5.4 percent of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a>.</p>\n<p>Before Spickard began Thursday’s lecture, he told students they were permitted to leave if they were uncomfortable with the sensitive material. About a dozen women and six men left.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Spickard included examples of perpetrators of sexual violence throughout history, a study of the degree of repentance within rapists’ language and a testimony by a victim.</p>\n<p>Spickard discussed historical sexual assault perpetrators such as the Roman Army in Rome, Kitty Schmidt’s brothel in Germany and Boko Haram in Nigeria. Each presentation slide showed an image of the victims.</p>\n<p>Before he read a victim’s testimony, Spickard warned the class about the subject matter. As he read, some students left in tears.</p>\n<p>“This lecture was hard because I knew I was saying something that would make some people in class uncomfortable because they had a terrible experience,” Spickard said. “I wanted to be as careful as I could be not to add to that.”</p>\n<p>He said he had a conversation with a student who expressed that men are not the only perpetrators of sexual violence. Spickard explained that he focused on men because it is more common for men to be perpetrators.</p>\n<p>According to a 2010 survey on sexual violence by the Center for Disease Control, female rape victims reported that 98 percent of perpetrators of sexual violence were male.</p>\n<p>Approximately 93 percent of male rape victims reported only male perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Spickard said he wanted to educate his students about sexual assault and how it is a part of many people’s lives, but also to confront possible perpetrators with a message they have been ignoring.</p>\n<p>“When I look out the doors of I.V. Theatre, I am reminded of where I am and what happens outside those doors,” he said. “If I’m in this community and a hurtful thing like this keeps happening, then I need to stand on the side of doing something about it.”</p>\n<p>“It is just not okay,” he said repeatedly. “It has to stop.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the May 3, 2018 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/","id":2833,"author":{"id":85,"name":"Vivianna Shields"},"related":[2832,2831,2830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Party Upsets Campus United’s Stronghold on A.S.","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7149.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7149.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Campus United remains dominant in the A.S.

Across the previous two years, Campus United (CU) had won seven of the eight available partisan executive seats.</p>\n<p>Campus United remains dominant in the A.S. Senate, after students elected 14 Campus United candidates and 10 from IVP.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Election Board, 8,233 undergraduate students, or 39.7 percent, voted in the election. This is the highest voter turnout since 2014.</p>\n<p>Students voted against the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NewCen renovation project</a> with an 81.69 percent no vote. The project had drawn widespread controversy across A.S. and on social media, largely due to the project’s costs.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited and thrilled that the students had the opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue,” said Hieu Le, current A.S. president and one of the project’s primary supporters. “We need to listen to what the students have to say in terms of supporting a different funding model for it, and that’s something that I stand by.”</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel was elected as the next A.S president and is the lone executive candidate elected from CU.</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, the Isla Vista Party’s candidate for president, said he is undeterred by the loss.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as tough a loss as I think a lot of people think it was,” he said. “People really showed up for us. We had a lot of votes in every category; I’m super proud of all the effort everyone’s put in. It was never about me, and it never will be about me.”</p>\n<p>Dumlao also said he will continue to make change on campus and said he believes the election has encouraged more students from all backgrounds to get involved at the university.</p>\n<p>“For all the unrepresented students out there, for all the queer students, for all the brown students, for all the Pacific Islanders, there’s a spot for you out there,” he said. “Last quarter, the quarter before that, every quarter I’ve been here, I always think I don’t belong here at UCSB. And this race has really shown me that we do belong here.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho with IVP won the internal vice president position against CU’s Anthony Pimentel by 636 raw votes. Ho is currently an on-campus senator in A.S. senate. Ho and Pimentel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico of CU and off-campus senator lost to IVP’s Jeike Meijer by nearly 600 raw votes for external vice president of local affairs. Meijer has said she will be the first Native American to serve as a UCSB A.S. executive. Dycaico and Meijer declined to comment.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Mayela Morales won the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) position against Madeline Loudon of CU. Both candidates declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson lost the vote for student advocate general (S.A.G.) against Grecia Martinez. Ettleson told the Nexus she was not “afraid of any candidate winning” because she believes everyone is competent and qualified.</p>\n<p>“I’m ecstatic about the whole executive slate because every single one is going to do such amazing things. I’m obviously disappointed; I think Grecia will be a great student advocate general,” Ettleson said.</p>\n<p>“I am relieved, ecstatic — it’s been a very long two weeks,” Martinez said after the win. She said she was excited to work with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum, to analyze statistics behind the election results to see where the students fall on campus issues.</p>\n<p>At a somber post-election meeting, CU party leaders urged those who fell short of elected seats to remain hopeful and active.</p>\n<p>“When I look at all of you here, as a fourth-year exec, you know what I see? I see the future of this fucking campus!” Kristin Hsu, the current EVPSA, told the party. “This is not Associated Students United, this is Campus United!”</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in there — fuck that!” she added.</p>\n<p>Kopel thanked the CU staffers for their help in her victory and echoed Hsu in telling the party to not give up their fight.</p>\n<p>“Campus United needs to stay united,” she said. “No matter what happens in there, we are the people who are best for this campus … We will come back again, and we will sweep again and again and again, no matter how long it takes.”</p>\n<p>A photo story from the night can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/in-photos-a-s-elections-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence, Sanya Kamidi and Jose Ochoa contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Hsu said “Associated Students United,” not “Soviet Students Union” as previously reported.

id=\"caption-attachment-82740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April. <em>Courtesy of Roberto Young</em></p></div>\n<p>John de Los Angeles, communications director for the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, said the union “exhausted” the bargaining process and the public employee relations board, which oversees labor disputes, declared the situation is “at a final impasse.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s 9,000 UC Service workers and 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers plan to strike from May 7 to May 9, according to a press release sent out Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>“It just doesn’t appear that we’re going to be reaching an agreement any time soon,” de Los Angeles said. “Strike is a measure of last resort.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s first local chapter within the UC system was created at UC Berkeley in 1948. Today, the union represents approximately 24,000 UC workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>The bargaining team, an elected body chosen to represent the workers, has the sole authority to call for a strike. The union’s bargaining team has met with the UC labor relations team nearly once every month for a year, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April.</p>\n<p>The release also asked speakers invited to UC graduation events to support union workers by “boycotting university engagements until the labor dispute is solved.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME conducted the voting over two days at locations across the UC’s 10 campuses, five medical centers and research laboratories among others, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>A small group of UC Santa Barbara students held a protest in front of De La Guerra dining commons on April 16 in support of the workers. AFSCME and other union workers within the UC have also previously held several protests on the UCSB campus, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/court-case-could-bring-financial-strain-to-public-sector-unions/\">most recently</a> on Feb. 15.</p>\n<p>The protests and subsequent vote to strike come following a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/39pjpl3gf26b93t/A3299_PioneeringInequality_WhitePaperNEW_Web_lo-res.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> analyzing demographics of workers across the UC campuses written and released by AFSCME in early April.</p>\n<p>The report stated non-white employees, specifically those in African-American and Latinx communities, are “often hired into lower-paying titles,” while white people are “hired into higher-paying titles.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the report stated male workers were given a higher average hourly starting pay rate than female workers.</p>\n<p>The average hourly starting pay rate for a white male patient care worker was $32.53 while for the same job, an African-American female was giving an average starting hourly pay of $24.97, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report also stated UC’s African-American workforce has shrunk by 37 percent since 1996.</p>\n<p>“A Black female patient care worker would need to work for 14 years to reach the starting pay of a white man,” the report states. “A Latina patient care worker would reach the starting wage of a white man after working for 13 years, and a Latina service worker would catch up to a white man’s starting wage after four years.”</p>\n<p>The report took data from UC employment records, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“They’re all coming in [for] starting positions, and women of color are just being paid less,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC has not yet released a public statement in response to the vote or the report, but de Los Angeles said the UC placed conditions in its union contracts “which is why our workers are so upset today.”</p>\n<p>Those conditions include raising the retirement age, raising healthcare rates and holding wages constant.</p>\n<p>“We strongly disagreed with AFSCME’s decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community,” said Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, in an email. “What the union demanded was a 6 percent annual wage increase, which we think is unfair to other UC employees – both represented and non-represented. This is twice what other UC employees have received.”</p>\n<p>Doan said that UCOP has decided to increase AFSCME employees’ wages by two percent for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“UC presented AFSCME leaders with what we believe to be a competitive final settlement proposal that included multi-year wage increases (3 percent annual for four years) along with excellent health and retirement benefits,” she said. “They chose to reject it without conducting vote among their members.”</p>\n<p>The workers’ healthcare premiums will be “brought in line” with the rest of UC’s represented and non-represented employees and the retirement benefits of current employees will remain unchanged while new workers will be offered a choice between a tradition pension or a 401(k)-style plan, according to Doan.</p>\n<p>The raises were stalled for more than a year due to “protracted negotiations,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Update: This article was updated to include information about the union’s upcoming strike. </i></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from the UC labor relations team. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
