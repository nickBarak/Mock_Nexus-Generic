Senators listen to funding requests from student organizations. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met yesterday in the State Street Room in the University Center to hear funds requests from eight student organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund one organization, table two requests indefinitely, recommend one organization to seek funding from senate and not fund four requests. They started the meeting with $12,009 in the culture weeks and graduation fund, $3,196 in the senate unallocated fund, and zero dollars in all other funds including the sports teams, OSL and Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP) funds.</p>\n<p>The Committee indefinitely tabled decisions on the Geography Club, which requested $260, and the Pacific Island Student Association, which requested $5228, because their representatives were not present.</p>\n<p>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion y Revolucion (M.U.J.E.R.), an advocacy group for Chicana and Latina students, requested $3,006.60 for the food and venue for their annual MUJERcitas conference, which has brought in around 150 high school girls each of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Committee chairman and third-year history of public policy Jimmy Villarreal said the committee had to deny M.U.J.E.R. of all funding, because their request would come out of SIOP.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cycling Team president Richard Lo requested $1,000 from Finance Board to offset the cost of airfare to road nationals, as the team has been unable to get funding from other sources.</p>\n<p>“We are looking to send four men and three women to road nationals in May,” Lo said. “We have already looked at rec sports and other external funding, but we haven’t gotten any.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said the committee had no money to grant the team.</p>\n<p>“We are zeroed out of our sports funds, but we will discuss if we can find any other source,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>The Film Studio requested $500 for purchasing food, a red carpet and rental of I.V. Theater for their upcoming annual festival.</p>\n<p>“We are currently organizing our fifth annual Santa Barbara Digital Film Festival,” the representative said. “The event is open to the entire campus. Anyone can submit.”</p>\n<p>The committee motioned to deny the Studio all requested funds and suggest they take their request to senate.</p>\n<p>The Pink Research Link, which encourages UCSB students to take interest in breast cancer research, requested $75 to help recruit new members using flyers.</p>\n<p>“It is already a small club, and it is mostly made up of the officers, which are either graduating or studying abroad next year,” the representative said. “We are really looking to recruit new students, because recently we have made a lot of progress in what we have been able to do for breast cancer awareness.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied the club’s request, but committee advisor Cindy Lopez suggested they request the $250 startup, which they would be guaranteed to receive if they meet the basic criteria.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Café (JLC) requested $280 for food and drinks for their quarterly potluck and karaoke party, which is historically their biggest event, but the committee denied their request.</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, the committee’s shrinking budget restricted all of their decisions.</p>\n<p>“We are getting toward the end of the year, so we’re low on funds now,” Villarreal said. “We allocated them to all the different student groups and we’ve had a lot of nice events.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

and lack of adequate punishment of perpetrators. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students gathered for a sit-in outside the Student Resource Building on Monday in protest of the university’s alleged mistreatment of sexual assault survivors and lenient punishment of perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, a second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major, organized the event in response to the alleged mishandling of her case by the Office of Judicial Affairs when she reported she had been sexually assaulted. Melgoza claims she was repeatedly silenced and mistreated by Judicial Affairs staff, with her assailant receiving a suspension for two academic quarters and set to return to UCSB this upcoming fall quarter to continue his studies.</p>\n<p>Amidst protesters’ loud chanting, Melgoza said she was discouraged by Judicial Affairs when she reported she was sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“I was raped in my dorm on January 18, 2014,” Melgoza said. “I ended up sitting down with a Judicial Affairs officer and unfortunately she discouraged me greatly. She said there was not enough evidence — that it might be a long and arduous process, implying that I would never win.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Melgoza, universities across the country are failing to properly address reports of sexual assault and provide support to survivors.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t stay silent because it’s such a huge problem,” Melgoza said. “Universities across the nation are protesting this because people are angry that such a horrible violent crime is not being treated seriously. If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime.”</p>\n<p>The university has released a statement on the matter, refusing to comment on the individual case but affirming the services available for students experiencing sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In order to protect the privacy of individuals, and to encourage future reporting of cases, we do not discuss details of individual cases. The University provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through CARE, our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The university also affirmed its adherence to UC policy and state and federal law.</p>\n<p>“We have a thorough student conduct process that we recently strengthened by moving sexual assault investigations to our Title IX office in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail.”</p>\n<p>Protesters called for UCSB administration and the UC system to restructure sexual assault policies and sanctions to allow for harsher repercussions for sexual assaulters and improved support for survivors. With these changes, protesters hope to eliminate the culture of silence surrounding the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, third-year feminist studies and English double major and co-chair of Take Back the Night, a student committee working with sexual assault survivors and advocates for the prevention of sexual assault, said the current sexual assault policies limit the university’s ability to properly discipline sexual assault perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“The only things the university can do are suspensions, expulsions and bans from campus — none of which they do very well,” Kauffman said. “I’ve personally never heard of anyone getting expelled for sexual assault. The maximum consequence for people who are found guilty of sexual assault is a two quarter suspension.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62371\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62371\" data-attachment-id=\"62371\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/students-protest-alleged-mistreatment/sit-in-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428935647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TBTN Sit In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62371\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Kauffman, staffers of the university’s existing support system for survivors are not properly trained and should be more accommodating to those who have been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“There is just consistent mishandling — the people who work in these spaces like the Judicial Affairs Office are obviously aren’t trained on how to talk or work with survivors,” said Kauffman. “When you’re going through a process that takes over a year and you’re constantly asked things that trigger you to think about something painful, that’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>According to Tanya Cortez, a friend of Melgoza and second-year math major, when Melgoza went to pursue the case, Judicial Affairs allegedly reported no longer having evidence of the case.</p>\n<p>“Her perpetrator left for personal reasons and when he came back, that’s when she felt very uncomfortable,” Cortez said. “She went again to pursue it … and they had like no records of their case. She had already reported [the crime] in spring, and they had no idea where this case was.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Marlene Alcantar was among the line of students holding giant signs to protest the mistreatment of survivors and said change needs to be implemented across all UC campuses regarding sexual assault policy.</p>\n<p>“I’m here to support Alejandra but also any other survivor that the system has not given justice to,” Alcantar said. “I wish the system was not so lax.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said every survivor goes through different experiences and must do what is comfortable for them to move past their experience.</p>\n<p>“Finding a way to empower yourself is the best way to make this happen; for example, I just released myself to social media,” Melgoza said. “At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. I want to make sure that these policies are enforced so I can keep moving on with my life and reach my goals.”</p>\n<p>[Update: A previous version of this article state the university did not return requests for comment.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five professors from various university departments spoke about recent developments in their research and other ideas at the third annual UCSB TEDx talk on Saturday in Embarcadero Hall in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Technology, Entertainment, Design, or TED, is a nonprofit organization aimed at spreading general knowledge about the world and new ideas through a series of conferences. The organization hosts a main event every year in Vancouver, Canada, but also promotes independently organized events on a local scale called TEDx. This year’s TEDxUCSB is titled “Unveiling the New: In the Pursuit of the Next” and was organized by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (RCSA).</p>\n<p>Featured presenters included chemical engineering professor Frank Doyle, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education lecturer Jason Duque Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff. Two pre-recorded TED talks by British journalist Matt Ridley and neuroscience professor at Baylor College of Medicine David M. Eagleman were also played at the event.</p>\n<p>Second-year zoology major and TEDx Event Organizer Edward Trout said TEDx conferences are valuable because the talks expose students to a slew of new ideas.</p>\n<p>“TEDx breaks through the brilliant shroud that surrounds all this knowledge and allows us all to see it, allows us to think about it, allows us to spread it around,” Trout said. “‘Ideas worth spreading,’ that’s the TED motto.”</p>\n<p>The attendee application required potential audience members to submit their own idea worth spreading, and answers were projected onto a screen as audience members entered Embarcadero Hall. The submissions ranged from the colonization of other planets to healthcare reform and the emotional struggle of the research process.</p>\n<p>Rios, the first presenter, spoke about the need to reassess current education strategies in order to effectively teach millennial students. According to Rios, this generation is considered by some authors and scholars to be the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic” generation yet, an idea he said he disagrees with.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Rios said the key to educating a globally connected millennial generation is to modify current strategies of education to be more emotional, citing studies that found millennials are more focused on personal connections and making an impact on society, rather than earning more money at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>Doyle spoke next and discussed his 20 years of research in control engineering, including the creation of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery in patients with Type 1 diabetes based on a concept called feedback control.</p>\n<p>“If I were to break down feedback control into a very simple definition, it’s these three words: ‘sense and respond,’” Doyle said.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, insulin pumps and glucose sensors are currently available to help diabetes patients, but only focus on either the sense or respond parts of the equation.</p>\n<p>“What’s missing is that conjunction in the middle, the ‘and,’” Doyle said. “So our research has been all about that little three-letter word, the conjunction ‘and,’ making these two pieces better, responding to glucose measurements, squirting the insulin in just such a way that we can optimize those blood sugars.”</p>\n<p>Doyle said the pancreas’s control of blood sugar levels is an example of a negative feedback loop, producing hormone insulin when blood sugar levels are high, in order stabilize blood glucose levels and glucagon when blood sugar levels drop in order to raise them. The pancreas produces insulin to mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of high blood sugar including organ damage, a process that fails to occur in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Doyle also said using a control algorithm in a chip or tablet connected to the sensing and responding technology allowed his research group to create a device to monitor and secrete insulin to stabilize the patient’s blood sugar levels to be in a healthy range, closing the feedback loop broken by diabetes, and thus treating a disease that currently affects millions.</p>\n<p>“The improper secretion of insulin leads to diabetes, which is a worldwide problem,” Doyle said. “It probably touches many of you in the audience, unfortunately. Friends, family members, neighbors — close to 400 million people in the world suffer from diabetes, and about half of them aren’t even diagnosed.”</p>\n<p>Varun Battu, a second-year biochemistry major, said he found Doyle’s talk fascinating because it applied biochemistry principles to technology.</p>\n<p>“It’s biochem — it’s literally what I like, and he’s applying it to a real world situation,” Battu said. “It’s really innovative and state-of-the-art — the top of his field.”</p>\n<p>Franklin’s talk focused on the growing, education-based gap between economic classes and how computer science, an increasingly important field, can help close this gap. Franklin said she believes computer science can be used to combat inequality by integrating it into fourth-through-sixth-grade curriculums, exposing underprivileged children to computing early in life.</p>\n<p>“All of these children would see that everyone can do it,” Franklin said. “There is nothing special about being in computing. Anyone can be in computer science.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she and a team of computer scientists created a summer camp called Animal Tlatoque, which combined educational workshops on culture, art and computing and, according to surveys, successfully heightened children’s interest in computer science.</p>\n<p>“By integrating computer science into an engaging, interdisciplinary camp we could really get students to get excited about it,” Franklin said.</p>\n<p>Professor Emeritus of sociology Thomas Scheff discussed the importance of expressing negative emotions in mental health.</p>\n<p>“Emotions are very confusing because we have a whole culture in the West which makes fun of emotions and ignores them and says they’re not important,” Scheff said. “When they do happen, they’re a pest.”</p>\n<p>Scheff said English’s inaccurate words for expressing emotions complicate the study of emotions.</p>\n<p>“It’s a field that is harassed, especially in English, by the ambiguity and circumstantial grasp of emotion terms,” Scheff said. “Pride can be a good thing. You should be proud your children accomplished so much, but it can also be the seventh deadly sin.”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, each emotion has a different signal of resolution — a different way the hormones produced by the emotion are metabolized by the body — and this signal is the healthiest way to deal with emotions.</p>\n<p>“When you’re talking about grief — if you lose someone that’s close to you, your body prepares to sob with tears … if that is delayed, you feel grief … fear, grief, shame, anger are not negative when they’re not obstructed,” Scheff said. “They go through your body — they’re something you need to do, just like breathing.”</p>\n<p>Duque spoke about reformulating common complaints about the educational system and trying to make the educational community understand that the current system shrinks students’ worlds by encouraging them to become competitive and answer-focused learners.</p>\n<p>“I think we mostly have things we can agree on when we think about school. School works for some kids and doesn’t for others,” Duque said. “We’ve got a collection of complaints about schooling but … then what?”</p>\n<p>Duque said he built a new set of complaints when he examined a kindergarten class in a dual immersion Spanish-English school designed to give underrepresented children a better chance to succeed academically. According to Duque, the students initially sought out other students to learn with, but the openness had decreased by January of the school year.</p>\n<p>“It begins to look like the children have learned that the world is not only theirs to explore, but that other people are either competitors for a place to declare what they know or they’re people who already possess knowledge,” Duque said. “Other people are threats and at least part of the time, other people are to be feared.”</p>\n<p>According to Duque, students’ passion for learning can only be encouraged by drastically changing how the students are formally taught.</p>\n<p>“Be outrageous in your refusal to do things the same old way because, let me tell you, we keep doing things the same old way; kids are going to keep learning the same old thing,” Duque said. “And that same old thing they’re learning is, from where I stand, a tragedy.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics math major and volunteer for the TEDx event Dixon Bourne said the event taught him to be more courageous.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to be less cautious,” said Bourne. “Just try things and not be afraid to fail. That’s probably one of the biggest things I learned.”</p>\n<p>Eric Seeberger, a second-year mechanical engineering major and TEDx attendee, said his “idea worth sharing” is about the increasing importance of finding sustainable energy solutions.</p>\n<p>“I think that the most important technology we should be researching is becoming energy independent,” Seeberger said. “Solar power is important and in the far future, nuclear fusion would probably be the best way to sustain that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major, Event Coordinator and Speaker Liaison Mary Alice Callaghan said she was amazed by the wealth of opportunities and ideas available to students in everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I took away from this conference, even more so than last year, was that there are just so many great minds and great opportunities on this campus — these great talks came from professors on our campus,” Callaghan said, “You think of TEDx as this really cool, once-a-year event that you come to experience these ideas, but they’re really out there all the time if you just go looking for them.”</p>\n<p>According to Trout, the TEDx model is important because it shares cutting edge ideas while fostering a sense of community.</p>\n<p>“TEDx embodies a mission that is important to me and important to all of us,” Trout said. “Not only is it presented to the community, TEDx is made by the community. Speakers of the sciences, arts and humanities — they all come together and present their ideas to you. They unveil the new and they allow all of us to pursue what’s next.”</p>\n<p>Trout said this year’s TEDx is especially important to him because TEDx 2014 was the last time he would see high school friend Chris Martinez, member of last year’s TEDx crew and victim of last May’s shooting.</p>\n<p>“When he [Martinez] found out we were putting on the TEDx event, he was so excited to be a part of it, to be part of what it was, part of what this is,” said Trout. “This TEDx is important to me personally now because it involves him. However, I would rather celebrate his life and what he did by showing you all awesome things rather than mourn him for too long.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While the festival’s date in India changes from year to year and took place on March 6 this year, Indus held the event on April 12 due to scheduling conflicts with other events last quarter. This year’s Holi event sold the most colored powder and attracted the largest crowd since Indus began hosting the event in 2013.</p>\n<p>Indus Representative and first-year chemistry major Yash Pal said Holi holds great significance in traditional Indian culture and brings together people from different social classes.</p>\n<p>“It’s meant to bring everybody together, so in India it would be like to celebrate the end of winter, the beginning of spring harvest time, so it’s a happy time,” Pal said. “In India there’s the caste system with lots of divisions, but when people play Holi you’re just supposed to all be wearing the same stuff, nobody knows what division you’re in — you all just get colorful like the same way.”</p>\n<p>According to Pal, UCSB Indus’ Holi event has similar meaning to the traditional celebrations taking place in India.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together,” Pal said. “This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together.”</p>\n<p>Indus Treasurer and third-year economics and mathematics double major Nitin Seelim said not only has the event drawn bigger crowds over the years, there has also been an increase in diversity among the students who attend.</p>\n<p>“It used to be South Asians specifically, but now we are getting more diversity,” Seelim said. “We started selling Holi powder last year and it was first conducted on this campus two years ago. Last year, we had about 1,000 people, now we have over 2,000 people, each year our turnout is much greater, and [we make] more money selling Holi powder which we use to help conduct other events.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together. This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together. – Indus Freshman Representative Yash</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seelim said he believes the Holi event was unique because it was hosted on the beach, making for a more aesthetically pleasing backdrop and easier cleanup.</p>\n<p>“In India it’s usually done on the streets or alleys where people just throw powder at each other. Not the best scene to look at,” Seelim said. “But beside the beach on campus, it’s very nice and much easier to clean up because the beach cleans it up. It happens once a year, a safe party kind of thing, but you get to learn more about the culture of India — how some events happen — and it attracts more people to our club.”</p>\n<p>According to Roshan Roy, Indus social chair and third-year biopsychology major, Holi is a way for the university community to learn more about Indian culture and add more variety to the UCSB social scene.</p>\n<p>“It adds a lot of diversity to our campus and enriches the culture so that we’re not a campus about partying and drinking,” Roy said. “It’s about learning about different cultures and overall just enriching our overall education.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Vinay Gupta said he has attended Holi every year since enrolling at the university when Indus began hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“Holi is growing in a lot of universities,” Gupta said. “It’s kind of becoming like a trend when it originally started as an Indian holiday, mainly because it’s a lot of fun. Everyone’s covered in color so you can’t tell who’s who, so it can make a statement about equality and race.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Jonah Calio said Holi exceeded his expectations and that he plans on attending next year.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it to be as big as it was. It was way more awesome,” Calio said. “I didn’t think I would get this colorful either. I just liked seeing people you know and hitting them with color.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Rachel Fulton said she was also surprised by the event’s turnout.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of people, and it was really fun,” Fulton said. “I didn’t think there was going to be as many people and as fun as it was. It was a good community experience. I really like the whole culture aspect of it, too. Everybody was friends, it doesn’t matter what you were doing; powder was everywhere.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

York City, where they won the Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row<em>. Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Model United Nations (MUN) won an Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row while representing Kuwait and Luxembourg at the National Model U.N. conference in New York last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The 22 members of UCSB MUN spent a little over one academic quarter preparing for the conference, at which they were split into pairs to represent a specific country, sit on various committees with different aims and write up legislation to combat various issues. A majority of the team represented Kuwait, and one pair represented Luxembourg in the Security Council. Over 150 schools and nearly 3,000 people attended the event, which took place from March 29 to April 2.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science and economics double major Jesse Lin said pairs worked together and used current events and the political history of their country to debate and write legislation to resolve present-day issues.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we try to come up with a resolution to solve these problems that the U.N. is facing currently in each of these committees,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and MUN delegate Benjamin Pu, the Outstanding Delegation award is only given to the top ten percent of participating schools.</p>\n<p>“This is our second year in a row winning it so we’re now established as a good model U.N. school,” Pu said. “If you win once at nationals it might be a fluke, but when you win twice in a row it’s definitely a powerhouse school.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Zeina Rousan said leadership skills shown by individuals on the team greatly contributed to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>“Almost every single person on the team was able to lead a working group; that’s probably why we ended up winning outstanding,” Rousan said. “We each practiced so much, knew so much information about these topics and were trained to be good diplomats that we were able to take all these people competing with us and have them want to work with us and have us lead in writing these resolutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, receiving outstanding delegation was a great accomplishment for the team and reflected the team’s hard work despite the large number of new members.</p>\n<p>“This year with a bigger team it’s really hard to manage, but everyone really tried,” Lin said. “Everyone worked really hard and researched a lot. There was a lot of outside research that they needed to do, and we ended up doing really well even though we had a lot of first-years who hadn’t done this before.”</p>\n<p>According to Pu, many of the members of the team also received individual recognition at the conference.</p>\n<p>“A couple of us took home position paper awards, and a couple of us took home delegate awards for doing the best in committee as well,” Pu said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Paul Krausse said visiting the United Nations headquarters was a memorable experience.</p>\n<p>“As a fourth-year but just a first-year in Model U.N., I felt somewhat intimidated by it but it was really great; we got to go to the U.N. headquarters in New York and that was an incredible experience, walking into Grand Hall was unbelievable,” Krausse said. “For anyone who was in Model U.N. it’s kind of like going to the holy grail of the U.N. That was such an incredible experience.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, a big part of the conference involved networking with people from all over the world and having their legislations recognized.</p>\n<p>“You get to meet a lot of new people in these conferences. You’re not only working together — you’re making friends,” Lin said. “At the end of the day you get to see your work posted on the website, and it makes you feel like you’ve really done something to mitigate these problems.”</p>\n<p>Krausse said faculty advisor for UCSB MUN Galen Stocking contributed greatly to the team, and recently moved to a new position at the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. after working with MUN for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“Galen’s contributions to the UCSB Model U.N. team are unbelievable, and I don’t know where UCSB Model U.N. would be without him,” Krausse said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/","id":2810,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2809,2808,2807],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Resolution Passes to A.S.

Senate, by a secret vote of six-to-one, a resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Israel-Palestine region.</p>\n<p>The one dissenting vote, made public shortly after the vote was taken, came from off-campus Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh. The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), urges the UC Board of Regents to withdraw its investments from companies selling arms and weapons to the Israeli government for or by the Israeli military on the grounds that such companies profit off of the military occupation of Palestinian-controlled territories, and that such investments are contrary to the obligation of the UC to promote equality and human rights for all.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row a divestment resolution related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been brought before the Senate, with prior iterations of the bill defeated in the past two years. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution at their weekly meeting next Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the idea of tabling the resolution came in light of Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, which takes place next Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>“While this resolution has been moved to committee and is expected to go out to the student senate, there are those who bring forward the idea that there is a Jewish holiday next week that would require it to be pushed another week,” Goodman said. “There is no one who is not Jewish who can tell me or the Jewish community that our holiday … is a reason not to bring this forward.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said he urged action on the resolution in order to allow the Senate to move forward on to other issues and also opposed further postponing a vote on the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Actually, it’s really patronizing for someone to have proposed that there are Jewish reasons, … that they, out their sensitivity for me and my community, would not want to bring it up,” Goodman said. “So I urge you to pass this out of committee so the Senate can deal with it and the campus can go on to dealing with this and other issues.”</p>\n<p>SJP member Nia, who requested to not have her full name disclosed, said she supported tabling the resolution for an additional week in light of Yom HaShoah.</p>\n<p>“It’s SJP’s mission to work against all forms of oppression, so we feel it’s really important to recognize that and honor that day for all Jewish students, and just let them know that we stand in solidarity … and recognize that and push it back another week so that it’s not at a time when a lot of people are sensitive,” Nia said.</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she found it “patronizing” and “offensive” to push the resolution vote back another week.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the week after week four, April 23rd, is Yom Hazikaron [Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism], so if you are doing your Jewish holiday searching you didn’t do an amazing job because … you’d have to wait ’til week five if that’s your logic,” Elyasi said. “Also to say that you are standing in solidarity with Jewish students when Jewish students feel attacked by a resolution that you’re bringing up to me is just a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said she was concerned about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement’s insistence upon the “Right of Return” for the 700,000 Palestinian refugees that are said to have been forcibly removed or evacuated from the territory that now constitutes the political boundaries of Israel.</p>\n<p>“If the Palestinians who no longer live in Israel were to return to Israel that would mean Israelis would be a minority, so Israel would cease to exist in its current state,” Moreh said. “To my understanding, that would mean the end of Israel.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur defended the passage of the resolution and said allowing Palestinian refugees return would not threaten Israeli sovereignty.</p>\n<p>“We at SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) absolutely stand by the Right of Return,” Kaur said. “We believe the people that were kicked out of their homeland have the right to return. However, I do challenge the notion that that would destroy the state of Israel altogether.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said she believes in the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that one people’s self-determination has to mean the end of another’s,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he advocated for the ability of students from both the Jewish and Palestinian community to make an effort to listen to empathize with one another.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been able to have real dialogue between both the Jewish community and the Palestinian community,” Abdalmalik said. “I highly encourage all of you, no matter how much you personally believe in your cause, to reach out across the aisle and to have open conversation that starts with unification between the two sides.”</p>\n<p>According to Abdalmalik, after engaging in discussion about divestment with students from both sides of the issue, he was able to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“I asked a lot of the folks in the Jewish community if you believe that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination — and every one of you said yes,” Abdalmalik said. “And I asked the folks on the other side of the aisle if they believe the Jewish people have the right to self-determination — and they said yes. That, in it of itself, is such a good start to seeing how we can form a resolution that promotes both people’s rights to self-determination.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/","id":2815,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[2814,2813,2812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brooks Discusses Death, Careers at Campbell","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Op-ed columnist, best-selling author highlights significance of important human traits and virtues beyond résumé appeal","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Op-ed columnist, best-selling author highlights significance of important human traits and virtues beyond résumé appeal</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_62219\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62219\" data-attachment-id=\"62219\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/brooks_hari-patel-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Brooks_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428524088\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brooks_Hari Patel-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Brooks_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Brooks_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62219\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Brooks_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=500%2C395\" alt=\"Brooks lectured at Campbell Hall on the status of virtue within our society, drawing a comparison between virtues important on a résumé versus those one might consider when writing a eulogy.

Brooks has been featured on ”PBS News Hour” and “All Things Considered” on NPR and has written several best-selling books.</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, two sets of virtue exist: “résumé virtues,” which he characterizes as qualities people bring to their jobs, and “eulogy virtues,” which Brooks said are characteristics people value in a deceased person.</p>\n<p>“Most people today are clear on how to have a good career, but not really clear on how to have a good eulogy,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>Brooks went on to say résumé virtues and eulogy virtues are in tension with each other, causing individuals who pursue good résumés to lose their ability to have a good eulogy.</p>\n<p>“[If you pursue résumé virtue] you turn into a shroud animal. You lack inner depth. You forget how to speak with a moral vocabulary. You live as an unconscious organism not really attached to the highest ideals, and you settle for a moral mediocrity,” Brooks said. “You’re not deserving of the eulogy you want, which only comes from an unfakeable virtue.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, people can overcome “moral mediocrity” by first confronting themselves and weighing their values on morals that he alleged have become less common in today’s culture.</p>\n<p>“To have that inner happiness, or even approach it, you have to step outside the ‘big me’ culture and you have to step back into a different moral collage, which used to be more common than now and which is based on a profound honesty about yourself,” Brooks said. “Character is built over the course of this confrontation with yourself.”</p>\n<p>Brooks also said stepping toward “inner happiness” comes from receiving help from others, rather than searching for self-help.</p>\n<p>“Character is not inside — no one is really strong enough to defeat selfishness or defeat self-obsession,” Brooks said. “We all need help from outside.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, pursuing virtue by self-confrontation and help from others makes it possible to escape the stresses and conflicts of a life of moral mediocrity.<br>\n“It is possible to go from scattered life to a really good life,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Leslie Medina said she was surprised that Brooks spoke on virtue, despite his reputation as a prominent political pundit.<br>\n“I feel like his talk was a little wishy-washy,” Medina said. “I wasn’t expecting what it came out to be.”</p>\n<p>Medina said she was glad she was able to attend Brooks’ lecture because he made profound points on the moral structure of modern culture.</p>\n<p>“I’m still glad I went because he had a lot of important things to say about society,” Medina said. “It left me with a lot to think about.”</p>\n<p>Second-year earth science major Ryan Kelleher said he particularly enjoyed when Brooks explored his characterization of eulogy virtue in today’s society.</p>\n<p>“I think he’s right in saying that people today just aren’t all that moral,” Kelleher said. “Virtue is something that everyone, especially college students, needs to keep in mind.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

engineering, computer science, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE), and sociology departments, will be held this Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m. in Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association and themed “Unveiling the New: In Pursuit of the Next,”  this weekend’s event will feature lectures by chemical engineering Professor Frank Doyle , GGSE lecturer Jason Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff.  Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) is a non-profit organization hosting conferences across the globe. TEDx events are local iterations of TED conferences independently organized by community members.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, he will be speaking on the development of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery for people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I’ve watched many TED and TEDx lectures over the years and it is humbling and exciting to be asked to give one,” Doyle said in an email. “[I hope to] bring attention to some of the exciting frontiers of research that are happening here at UCSB – especially on medical problems despite the fact that we do not have a medical school.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she will be discussing the digital divide in the United States — referring to inequalities in access to information and communication technology in different parts of the world — as well as the importance of integrating computer science in elementary school curriculum.</p>\n<p>“The last generation needed to be competent users of computers to succeed professionally, but the innovators of the next generation will need to … understand how to harness the power of computers to create revolutionary products,” Franklin said in an email. “My work has the goal of understanding how to integrate computing into elementary school so that all students, regardless of background, have the opportunity to participate in this revolution.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he plans to speak on reassessing how the Millennial generation, referring to individuals born between the 1980s and mid-2000s, are taught in American schools with an emphasis on teacher effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in the education system, we have to teach to the heart and not just to the mind,” Rios said. “That’s effective teaching — to teach with affection rather than focus on being effective as a teacher. Since this generation is more emotion-based, shouldn’t we teach through emotions?”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, his talk will focus the fundamental emotion of shame as well as the importance of not hiding emotions.</p>\n<p>“There’s no such thing as a negative emotion. They’re like breathing — they cause trouble only when they’re obstructed,” Scheff said. “It’s not a good idea to hide shame, or any emotion for that matter. You need to work through it.”</p>\n<p>Raley said his talk will discuss the importance of reshaping future discussions on education.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that kids are learning too little — it’s just that they’re learning too much of the wrong thing,” Raley said. “I would love for us to have much more thoughtful conversations about education. I think that the kind of conversations we have … [are] pretty conventional most of the time — the same problems, the same ideas.”</p>\n<p>Third-year zoology major and UCSB TEDx event organizer Edward Trout said he hopes the event will expose students to important ideas otherwise less accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the idea is finding what’s new, or what maybe even is old and dispersing it to a wider audience,” Trout said. “Scientists, academics — we study things and we make these papers and circulate them among ourselves and they never get out to the public. What’s the point? If all these ideas never leave the ivory tower, nothing’s going to change.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

his involvement in the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and the organization of social protests that led up to it in 3824 Ellison Hall today at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>The lecture, entitled “The Inside Story of the Egypt Revolution,” will be hosted by the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center Research Focus Group and sponsored by the Center for Middle East Studies and the Department of Political Science. Shehata is currently the Vice Chairman and Programs Director of the Sadat Association for Development and Social Welfare, and specializes in research on youth mobilization through social media, Al-Qaeda ideology and conflict lines between Christianity and Islam.</p>\n<p>Political Science professor Cynthia Kaplan said she met Shehata in Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall and at that time invited him to speak. Shehata holds a first-hand account of what it was like to be on the ground during the Egyptian protests during 2011, according to Kaplan.</p>\n<p>“He is a rather remarkable informant on those events and consequences,” Kaplan said. “It is a wonderful opportunity to hear a perspective from below from someone who was a participant.”</p>\n<p>According to a brief biography written by Shehata for the lecture, he is currently working on human rights issues in Egypt, including “peaceful demonstrations, freedom of opinion, expression and information, and housing rights.”</p>\n<p>Kaplan said aspects of Shehata’s lecture that will be particularly appealing to student audiences involve his extensive involvement in youth mobilization during the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He was essential in organizing youth participation during the events of the Egyptian Revolution and still is,” Kaplan said. “So this idea of social mobilization is very interesting for those who are interested in social movements in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaplan, Shehata participated in key negotiations between activists and members of the military and can offer additional unique perspectives to conventional academic studies on the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He took part in roundtables with elites and military members, so his perspective is rather refreshing in that he provides insights that a more academic, distanced study cannot,” Kaplan said.</p>\n<p>First-year communications major Ruben Rodriguez said he is interested in the fall of governments and ruling elites, and looks forward to attending the talk.</p>\n<p>“A lot of governments recently have been overthrown through civil protest, so it’ll be interesting to see [Shehata’s] account of protests in Cairo during 2011,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics and accounting major Nicholas Lynch, his Middle Eastern Studies class this past Fall Quarter peaked his interest in the Egyptian Revolution.</p>\n<p>“The Middle East is still in flux and it would be interesting to not only hear his accounts of the revolution in 2011, but also hear what he has to say about the future state of many other countries in turmoil,” Lynch said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/","id":2813,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2812,2811,2810],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Committee to Erect I.V.

The committee discussed specific details of the various event and art installation ideas, and members said they hope to see their plans come to fruition in the weeks surrounding the May 23 tragedy’s anniversary.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy opened the meeting by restating the special committee’s objective to plan an event that reflects the student body and I.V. community’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I really want this to be something community-generated, something that feels organic and that the community would want to see happen,” Guthy said. “It shouldn’t be something that’s official or that we need to do just because we should. It’s whatever’s right for us.”</p>\n<p>Guthy told the committee that A.S. would help with a candlelight vigil on May 23 which she said will be similar to the vigil A.S. hosted in the days following last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students is interested in helping to facilitate a memorial walk/candlelight vigil like we did last year,” Guthy said. “That is one of the events that I personally would like to attend and see as a member of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the Surf Club will likely help with a memorial paddle-out similar to last year’s, which would take place sometime during the week after the anniversary.</p>\n<p>“We’ve spoken with Surf Club, who hosted that last year, and they’ve expressed interest in hosting another one,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board Commissioner and fourth-year global studies major Benjamin Simons said the board would be able to provide logistical support for the May 23 vigil.</p>\n<p>“We would like to help really put on the vigil,” Simon said. “We will be providing our sound system like we did last time and security like we did last time.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould encouraged A.S. to end the walk at Perfect Park, because IVRPD will be dedicating a memorial garden there on May 16.</p>\n<p>“We could have a stage or speakers at the end to incorporate the memorial garden,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Spatial Studies Professor in the art department Professor Kim Yasuda said there will likely be an art installation in Perfect Park if A.S. and the art department can gather funds to commission Bamboo DNA Founder Gerard Minakawa, who has designed structures for music festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, to create something for the anniversary memorial.</p>\n<p>“[He] is very interested in contributing his artistic ability … to do something appropriate that would be an illuminated structure,” Yasuda said. “Our goal is that it would be the start of a structure or even a sculpture in that park and that it becomes kind of a centerpiece.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said members of the art department are collaborating on a concept of a blue LED-lit pathway from campus to I.V. that would line the silent walk portion of the May 23 vigil and create a “collective force.”</p>\n<p>“I think a concept that would be really powerful would be if we started to light things in May and then people, businesses, community members started contributing to this blue light,” Yasuda said. “Then, by the 23rd, it’s kind of an experiment in how people build solidarity.”</p>\n<p>The art department is exploring ways to allow individual students to place the LED lights, so students who cannot or choose not to participate in the vigil can express support for the remembrance events, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to get all stakeholders contributing something together,” said Yasuda. “If we started in May, it could accumulate by social media.”</p>\n<p>Education and Outreach Coordinator at UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program and alumnus Marjan Riazi said the C.A.P.S. clinical staff will make themselves available at the vigil to support students in need of their services.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the clinical staff would be happy to be there as emergency first responders for people who are triggered,” Riazi said.</p>\n<p>Guthy said the committee is still making decisions on how they will use university emails and social media to publicize the events once plans are finalized.<br>\n“We want to get the information out — at least about the dates — sooner rather than later,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Associated Students External Affairs Committee will consider this campus’s divestment resolution at its 6 p.m. meeting today after tabling the proposal at its meeting last week.</p>\n<p>Second-year music major and SJP member Daniel Moltke said the wall was built in order to spark discussion among the campus community about the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and Gaza as well as to inform interested students on the current divestment resolution.</p>\n<p>“We want them to know there is this divestment campaign happening these weeks and that the vote will hopefully be happening Wednesday,” Moltke said. “Our main objective is to spread awareness and let people know that there’s something we can do about it and something we can do about it right now.”</p>\n<p>Third-year history major and SJP member Aaron Reveles said the wall travels to different campuses each spring quarter or semester in order to educate UC students statewide about the UC’s financial holdings in corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, which all allegedly profit from Israeli government policies in the Palestine/Israel region.</p>\n<p>“This is a communal wall that travels to different campuses,” Reveles said. “We drove down to the last school it was at, which was Pitzer College in [Pomona], with a U-Haul truck we rented out. A group of us worked hard and put it together.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, the UC divestment campaign regarding Palestine/Israel reflects a similar past UC resolution calling on an end to apartheid in South Africa.</p>\n<p>“There’s people that were big in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, who mentioned specifically the UC’s divesting was a significant part in the turnaround of their movement,” Moltke said. “So we hope that by getting all of the UC’s on the same page, we can get the regents to stop funding these corporations that perpetuate violence and oppression.”</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum said while he believes the wall facilitates political discussion, its messages do not represent multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I’m so happy I’m on a campus like UCSB that facilitates free speech,” Tannenbaum said. “I think that it’s great this wall is up and that it’s starting political discourse. But I really wish … that there had been some form of collaboration, or this wall had shown two sides of the story … I believe it really, really does not.”</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also said the campaigns associated with the wall represent an “affront” to Jewish self-determination.</p>\n<p>“On this board it says Zionism equals racism … the general definition of Zionism is the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people free from persecution with the right of self-determination,” Tannenbaum said. “Saying that idea is racism — the existence of a Jewish state is racism — personally affronts my belief in the idea that I can have a place as a Jew where I am free from persecution.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, despite the presence of the wall, Palestinian students often feel victimized and afraid to voice their opinions at public forums due to potentially consequential future circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There are Palestinians who are afraid to speak at these public meetings because someone pro-Israel can record them and send it to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” Moltke said.</p>\n<p>Moltke said SJP student groups across the UC feel compelled to display the wall and spark discussion among students because of the challenges Palestinians face expressing free speech abroad.</p>\n<p>“The Israeli government won’t let you into Palestine if you’re pro-divestment or anti-Israel. There are no airports in Palestine so you have to go through Israel and if students speak out,” Moltke said, “they may never get to see their families in Palestine. So it’s up to us to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Hannah Ellenhorn however said she does not agree with the wall and its illustrations supporting divestment, and believes that the resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Palestine/Israel area is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“At the core of the conflict is a refusal for Arab populations to recognize the right of Jewish self-determination in Judea and Samaria,” Ellenhorn said. “The recent move for college campuses to boycott Jewish-owned businesses based in Israel is nothing more than blatant Jew-hatred masked in a degenerate view of social justice.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year computer engineering major Nader Khalil, however, United States’ corporations should cut funding to companies profiting from human rights violations everywhere in the world, no matter who the perpetrators or victims are.</p>\n<p>“Human rights on all scales are important,” Khalil said. “I see the West Bank Settlements as an issue. There is hate from both sides. A practical solution would be to cut American funding of these Israeli settlements and other war crimes that were committed on Gaza. Have a fair trial for the crimes that happen and move from there.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Tannenbaum stating “Zionism equals racism…the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people.” Tannenbaum actually defined Zionism as the belief in a nation for the Jewish people.

After a screening of S02E06, “You Also Have a Pizza,” the director, film and media studies faculty member Allison Anders, held a Q&amp;A session ending with a reception in the lobby. The event was co-sponsored by the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and the Department of Film and Media Studies and Davidson Library’s “UCSB Reads,” which chose Kerman’s memoir as this year’s campus-wide reading selection.</p>\n<p>When film and media studies faculty member Cynthia Felando asked Anders how she began watching the show, Anders said “OITNB” is one of the few shows she has “binge watched.”</p>\n<p>“I watched everything and I thought it was a really brilliant pilot, and of course I loved the fact that there was so many women in one show. It was amazing to me,” Anders said. “I love it that Piper was so well equipped for prison — it was just like the greatest thing to me that all of her sort of yuppified, kind of hipster stuff was not going to fly in prison. But yet it also became how she coped.”</p>\n<p>Anders said race, class and age are balanced in the series, and that the characters’ shared situation equalizes their different backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“That is the genius of Jenji Kohan, who created the show,” Anders said. “Whether it is a guard or inmate, there is a humanity there. There is a heart under that, there is a person who is struggling, and I thought that was just amazing with these characters — all of the characters, really.”</p>\n<p>Responding to an audience member’s question, Anders said she is an active feminist in the midst of the film industry’s gradual acceptance of women in the business.</p>\n<p>“I do feel like it is getting better,” Anders said. “It gets better in small increments each year. It is remarkable how far behind the industry is, and I do not understand why.”</p>\n<p>Felando said Anders, who has directed films such as “Gas Food Lodging” (1992) and “Mi Vida Loca” (1993), and episodes of “Sex in the City”, “The L Word” and “The Mentalist,” has had a full and fulfilling career.</p>\n<p>“Film and episodic television, and now streaming with Netflix,” Felando said. “It is like the gamut.”</p>\n<p>Assistant University Librarian for Outreach and Academic Collaboration Rebecca Metzger said UCSB Reads has brought people together with its screening of “OITNB”.</p>\n<p>“UCSB Reads is meant to bring the UCSB and Santa Barbara communities together to read and discuss a common book,” Metzger said in an email. “While the UCSB Library plans and hosts most of the programming, we encourage others on campus and in the community to organize their own events around the book, too.”</p>\n<p>Campus groups such as the Literature Club and the Queer Book Club have read OITNB, and the Associated Students campaign Invest in Graduation Not Incarceration, Transform Education (I.G.N.I.T.E.) hosted events focusing on the book, according to Metzger.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had faculty from the Department of Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology talking about local rehabilitation programs for inmates, and faculty from the Theater &amp; Dance Department talking about empowering incarcerated youth through theater and faculty from English and the Writing Program talking about the drama of prison narratives,” Metzger said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Reads had a speaker from the university Office of Judicial Affairs talk about how the restorative justice process is applied on campus to students who violate university policy.</p>\n<p>“That discussion was attended by many students in the Teacher Education Program on campus who wanted to know how to apply restorative justice to the K-12 setting,” Metzer said.</p>\n<p>Through UCSB Reads, Metzger said restorative justice issues have been brought to a local level and made meaningful for students in their work and research.</p>\n<p>“You only have to stop by the lobby of the UCSB Library to view our exhibition of photographs of girls in the juvenile justice system by Art Professor Richard Ross and read the comment book to understand the impact of these issues to our students and community,” Metzger said in an email. “There are students here who have been in juvenile facilities, or whose parents or other family members have been in or are in prison.”</p>\n<p>The last UCSB Reads event on Orange is the New Black will be Wednesday, April 15 at 8 p.m. when Orange is the New Black author Piper Kerman will deliver a free, public talk titled “The Real Story Behind ‘Orange Is the New Black’” at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The meeting also addressed the success of this year’s Deltopia festivities and the continuing security of I.V. in future years with regard to the festival.</p>\n<p>The reputation and presence of Greek organizations on campus was also discussed, with an emphasis on looking toward greater unity between Greek organizations and the university for future events.</p>\n<p>The senators heard from representatives from C.A.P.S about the organization’s future plans and needs. Assistant Clinical Director of C.A.P.S Turi Honegger said a new wellness center is going to open in I.V. in 2015.</p>\n<p>“I have seven offices that are going into Isla Vista,” Honegger said. “It’s going to be above the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic. Four of those offices are going to be dedicated to full-time psychologists. That will be available for all students and any I.V. resident can get a consultation.”</p>\n<p>According to Honegger, the C.A.P.S program is very popular with a significant portion of the student body, bringing in nearly 25 students for initial mental health assessments on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>“That’s over one hundred a week, and over the course of a quarter that’s over five percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S Student Mental Health peer Janice Ong said the mental health peer program could use more space.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing as best we can to provide mental health services to students, but expansion can be done in this situation,” Ong said. “For example, as of now we don’t have a dedicated space for students to come in to talk, usually when drop-ins happen we try our best and maybe a clinician can give up their office for twenty minutes for us to use.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy introduced the Senate to the Dear Governor Brown campaign which starts Friday and aims to educate students regarding the “financial irresponsibility within the UC system stemming from Governor Brown’s plans for higher education.” The campaign mainly focuses on his plans for expediting graduation and expanding online education.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the irresponsible use of information by the governor’s office is “disconcerting” to the A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“The governor’s office has desired to increase summer sessions as a way to expedite graduation rates,” Guthy said. “But they weren’t aware that Pell grants and other aids don’t cover summer sessions. And summer sessions are usually more expensive because they are paid by units.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said she is concerned about the lack of a long-range budget planning for the UC system which is aggravated by Brown’s endeavor to make budget allocations on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>“They acknowledged that they did not have long term vision when they were planning the budget,” Guthy said. “When you’re conceding that you don’t have long term vision when you’re funding a major institution like University of California, it’s seriously problematic.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the governor is cutting funds from the wrong places, and she disagrees with the suggested changes.</p>\n<p>“The governor is being insistent on trimming the fat of the UC,” Guthy said. “Unfortunately, it seems like the ‘fat’ he is trying to trim is the student resources and services that we get. I would characterize it as trying to industrialize the student experience. Moving it [education] online and making it faster doesn’t make it better.”</p>\n<p>Guthy discussed the halted plans for redesigning the A.S. main entrance, saying A.S. would seek funding from alternative sources for the proposed new entrance from campus to the A.S. main office due to its predicted cost amounting to $10,000 as opposed to the projected $5,000.</p>\n<p>“My plan is to go to the UCen Governance Board and talk with them about potentially contributing to the design and funding, if that’s something we’re still interested in pursuing,” Guthy said, “because there is a renovation fund for the UCen, so I’m curious to see if they would be willing to contribute to that project.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk spoke to the Senate about Deltopia’s success and the upcoming planning for next year’s event to ensure continued success of the event. Schunk said he is currently recruiting participants from the Office of Student Life in order to get involvement from a diverse pool of students.</p>\n<p>“This coming week we are going to be having what I am calling ‘Del-scussion,’” Schunk said. “It’s going to be an opportunity for everyone to get together and have a dialogue about what they liked about this Deltopia and what they really didn’t like.”</p>\n<p>Schunk discussed updates on district boundary bill AB 3, saying consensus had been reached on taxation powers. Schunk also said funding was coming from the Fund for Santa Barbara, The Santa Barbara Foundation, Santa Barbara County, the university and Assemblymember Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>“Were still working on deciding on board structure and actual boundaries of the district,” said Schunk. “The issue is not so much where is the money coming from anymore. It’s who’s the financial host going to be.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also discussed a tentative plan for Greek organizations within I.V., suggesting a series of Greek workshops centered around educating Greek life on their responsibility to the campus and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Part of the goal there is to empower Greek students and make them feel as if they can be stewards of this community,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>The senators also voiced different opinions on whether UCSB Extension students who do not pay A.S. fees should be able to attend student-only events like Extravaganza.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said extension students should be allowed to attend with additional fees.</p>\n<p>“They could be allowed to attend, but they would have to pay,” Lau said. “So for example, The Warm-Up was five dollars for us, but Extension students would pay way more than that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology and feminist study double major Daisy Fernandez said allowing extension students into campus events could open the door for too many non-affiliated students.</p>\n<p>“Program Board does not like this idea at all because this opens the door to other people, like SBCC students or members of the public saying, ‘Hey they get to buy tickets, why don’t we get to buy tickets?’” Fernandez said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/senate-talks-c-a-p-s-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/senate-talks-c-a-p-s-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/senate-talks-c-a-p-s-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/senate-talks-c-a-p-s-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/senate-talks-c-a-p-s-more/","id":2847,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2846,2845,2844],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Author Lectures on Social Pressure of Technology","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3152-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3152-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"Writer and fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia Matthew B.

Crawford gave a lecture on modern technology and the mind Tuesday night in Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, Crawford’s talk, “The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction,” discussed a phenomenon called the “crisis of attention,” which explores the distractive capabilities of modern day technology and reliance on social media for purposes of comfort and confidence. Crawford’s goal is to convince individuals, particularly youth, to be more aware of their surroundings and less consumed by technological distractions such as television and cellular devices.</p>\n<p>According to Crawford, societal pressures exist that encourage people to stay up-to-date with trends and popular entertainment as opposed to such topics such as classic literature. Crawford said engrossment with modern technology has been “normalized.”</p>\n<p>“I’d be sitting down on my comfortable couch about to read Plato and rediscover my love for complex philosophy,” Crawford said. “I would read a few pages, realize that my favorite TV show is on, so I switch on the TV and now I’m not a societal freak and can talk to some people about it. If I just read Plato and tried to talk to someone about the next day, they’d think I was a bit of a freak.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said ‘”distractibility” is facilitated by technology and provides a colorful, attractive world as opposed to a dull world without the distractions.</p>\n<p>“The more we delve into these distractions, whether it be Facebook or Candy Crush or whatnot, we start to view the normal world as more bland and tasteless,” Crawford said. “It doesn’t offer the same amount of fun and entertainment that your marshmallow treat phone application has. So then we get hungry for it, and we go running back to our phones.”</p>\n<p>Crawford also said self-esteem and sense of worth is tied to the attention users of social media get on social media sites.</p>\n<p>“To be distracted is to be entertained and awed by all these fake experiences,” Crawford said. “Our self-dignity depends on social media which then creates a fragile self, which makes us dependent on constructed experiences to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>Goleta resident Michael Jung said as a teacher he often encountered students who were unable to detach themselves from technology and relied on phone applications to solve problems.</p>\n<p>“I taught high school [trigonometry] and I just couldn’t believe how many kids would just sit and play on their phones if I left them alone,” Jung said. “One girl even asked why we need to learn math if there’s ‘an app for that.’ To be educated, that’s why!”</p>\n<p>Jung also said he found it refreshing to see young people take interest in activities and experiences other than technology.</p>\n<p>“When I see people actually take an interest in other things — traditional art, music, dancing — I feel better,” Jung said. “I know technology hasn’t consumed every part of their life.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Margaret Rhiner said she believes youth need to be reminded to enjoy their physical environment and interact with people around them.</p>\n<p>“They don’t realize it anymore, or maybe they’re just numb to their surroundings,” Rhiner said. “I go to the beach and I’m baffled to see all these kids on their phones instead of admiring the water or playing in the sand. Young people don’t talk to people anymore and they’re all obsessed about the next big invention.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said students should take advantage of campus and its surrounding scenery while they still have the opportunity.</p>\n<p>“If you’re a UCSB student, you’re living on the edge of the Pacific Ocean,” Crawford said. “You will never, ever, live anyplace like this again. I mean, unless you’re a billionaire or something. I think of a 20-year-old walking on the beach with his head stuck in Facebook and it just breaks my heart. Live a little. It’s worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Hall.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Navy Sea, Air, Land Teams (SEAL) soldier and best-selling author Eric Greitens spoke at Campbell Hall on Thursday night on his recently released book<em> Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em>, a compilation of 23 letters between Greitens and a former SEAL comrade who was struggling with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p>Greitens, who was awarded the United States Armed Forces Bronze Star and listed on <em>Fortune</em> magazine’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders in 2014 and<em> Time</em> magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2013, spoke to a crowd of approximately 250 students, faculty, community members and Arts &amp; Lectures donors. Greitens is also a Rhodes Scholar, a White House Fellow and founder and CEO of The Mission Continues, a non-profit organization which challenges veterans to serve and lead in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lecture, Greitens focused on how to grow from personal experiences, stating that growth is necessary to move on from past hardship.</p>\n<p>“You cannot bounce back from hardship. You can only move through it,” Greitens said. “No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering. Yet from pain can come wisdom; from fear can come courage; and from suffering can come strength — if we have the value of resilience.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through – Eric Greitens</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greitens also discussed the importance of meeting obstacles in order to progress in life and said that, as Navy SEALS, he and his colleagues understood the word “frontline” to mean “the place where we met the enemy,” but frontline is not just a “military term.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, you have a frontline in your life now,” Greitans said. “Everyone has a place where they encounter fear, where they struggle, suffer, and face hardship. … It is on the frontline of our lives that we earn wisdom, create joy, forge friendships, discover happiness, find love and do purposeful work.”</p>\n<p>According to Greitens, the most important factor in dealing with hardship is figuring out to work through life’s challenges.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a place in life where they have to deal with hardship and challenge and pain and difficulty fear,” Greitens said. “But it’s often our ability to navigate those places — of hardship and difficulty — that grow essential to our ability to live life in a purpose, productive and meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Greitens said he believes resilience is a way of working through hardship rather than returning to a state of being prior to experiencing hardship.</p>\n<p>“When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through,” Greitens said. “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences. They find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives. In time, people can confront great calamity with great spirit and can create great strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major at Golden West College in Huntington Beach Nick Wolfe said he traveled to Goleta, CA., from Anaheim to hear Greitens speak.</p>\n<p>“I’m a fan of his work,” Wolfe said. “I’ve read his past book <em>The Heart and The Fis</em>t and I’ve acquired his other book, which is pretty similar.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience. But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. – Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolfe said he was considering joining the military before he sustained a personal injury, but still enjoys learning about Greitens’ military career.</p>\n<p>“I’ve read the book already and some of the things he did say were verbatim,” Wolfe said. “But he did hit a lot of the more important topics harder on the head as he felt necessary and it was nice to hear it in his voice for the first time. That was awesome. I have respect for humanity and life in general and the way he approaches and sees it is really fascinating. Really, it’s respectable.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Herman Li said he attended Greitens’ lecture because of his prior training experience with the United States Marine Corps. According to Li, the lecture was more successful and influenced him more than previous, similar events he has attended.</p>\n<p>“I just thought his advice on getting through pain and suffering was really good … to build resilience,” Li said. “I wasn’t expecting this many people because I went to an event a few weeks ago where a marine was speaking and there was only like ten people.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Patrick Mossman said he attended the lecture to learn more about the military.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in joining Army ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] here and I just decided to come because I thought it would be interesting hearing from someone, especially a Navy SEAL,” Mossman said. “He had a lot of interesting things to say. I definitely learned some things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin said hearing Greitens speak was as an impactful learning experience.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience,” Franklin said. “But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. I liked his ideas of growing from what we have experienced. He said something like, ‘What happens to us becomes a part of us’ and that really resonated with me.”</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, Greiten’s idea of “segmenting,” or breaking work assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks, was helpful.</p>\n<p>“That’s helpful in everyday life,” Franklin said. “As students, and a lot of us with jobs, we have busy lives that can seem overwhelming. So I’ll be using this segmenting advice in my life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/","id":2841,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2840,2839,2838],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":68,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
