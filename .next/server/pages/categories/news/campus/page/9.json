He shared their annual report with me and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to do this.’ And that’s been my goal from when I started here,” Olowude said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Olowude said C.A.P.S. has been organizing its data — gathered in Excel sheets —  and consolidating it with other universities in the UC system, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of work [in the] unification of our data to make sure that what I’m calling something, someone on another campus is also calling it [the same thing],” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterns revealed in the data collected will allow C.A.P.S. to pinpoint the cause of any dips in the number of visits, Olowude said. The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families. Well, when they’re here, they don’t have to and it’s confidential,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these students in particular, C.A.P.S. created the position of assistant director of Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion. The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing. I’m very proud of the staff that we’ve been able to compile that work here. And I’m very humbled by and honored by the respect and the support our students have given us,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the January 16, 2018 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

released during the demonstration. </span>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were put together from over 1,000 survey responses from a Google form the organization first released during the demonstration, according to Alana Ulloa, historian of Intersectional Feminists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ulloa said in October that the organization “really want[ed] to make sure these demands are representative of what the student collective wants.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization plans to present the demands to the university and “see what they try to implement with that,” but Ulloa and President Kyremina Youssef added that they hope to work closely with specific administrators like Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead. The two admininstrators have primarily been the ones communicating with students regarding incidents of sexual violence in the community.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the eight demands released on Monday includes formally requesting a statement of acknowledgement “from Sigma Pi and other fraternities involved in recent sexual violence and misconduct apologizing to survivors, acknowledging the perpetuation of rape culture, and denouncing the actions of removed members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a Sigma Pi member had been removed from the fraternity after the fraternity president learned of sexual assault allegations against the member involving two separate women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with one of the women, who said she reported the sexual assault to Sigma Pi’s president after she learned that the same fraternity member had allegedly sexually assaulted another woman later the same night, Oct. 3. The woman said at the time that she did not file a report with the university or local police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in October, another person reported to the university that they had been raped in a bedroom at the Sigma Pi house. On Oct. 28, UCSB sent out a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the report, but the warning did not clarify if the suspect in the case was a member of fraternity or not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB chapter of Sigma Pi has yet to publicly comment on the allegations of sexual assault made against former or current members or reports of sexual assault that have occurred on fraternity property. The national office of Sigma Pi said in October that they had </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/sigma-pi-operations-suspended-by-national-executive-office-while-ucsb-investigates-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suspended operations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the UCSB chapter while the university and local law enforcement investigated the allegations, but they did not respond to follow up questions at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus reached out on Monday regarding the status of the chapter’s suspension, the national office did not respond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to keeping fraternities accountable, Intersectional Feminists is demanding that, moving forward, fraternity leaders be designated as mandatory reporters “of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX.” Mandatory reporters, otherwise known as “</span><a href=\"https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix/sexual.harassment.and.sexual.violence/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible employees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” are “required to notify the Title IX office if a student brings information about, or an employee becomes aware of, a possible incident of sexual violence or sexual harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also demands that any fraternity accused of sexual misconduct be suspended while it is investigated, and that communication with the student body regarding reports of sexual misconduct at a fraternity or a fraternity’s suspension must be “immediate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two other demands on the list address the university’s communication after incidents of sexual violence. The university </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was criticized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the fall for its slow response to the October reports, after which university officials held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meeting to address students’ concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One demand would require the university to also keep UCSB staff and faculty in the loop through emails from the university regarding the actions it is taking to address sexual violence. Youssef said that one of the responses the survey had received was from a staff member who was receiving timely warnings regarding incidents of sexual violence, but didn’t receive any follow-up communication from the university that students were receiving, such as </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/webview/c5to3e/6d9fb6f180a39341b8837e9b18119fec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Klawunn and Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another demand calls for a “transparent” Clery Student Right To Know daily log and for a University of California Police Department (UCPD) crime map. While the UCPD currently maintains a daily log of “crimes that have been reported to the University of California Police Department” and a map, Youssef said the organization would like to see more consistently updated versions of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization is also demanding that </span><a href=\"http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/overview/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus climate surveys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which survey “faculty and other academic appointees, students, staff, trainees, and post-doctoral scholars about their experiences and perceptions of campus or workplace climate,” be conducted on a more consistent basis and include questions regarding sexual violence that occurred on- or off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC conducted its first system-wide campus climate study between fall 2012 and spring 2013; UCSB was found to have the highest reported rate of “‘unwanted sexual contact’ while at UCSB within the last five years,” the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2014/04/01/ucsb-students-happy-but-sexual-misconduct-concerns-exist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to more frequent surveys, Intersectional Feminists wants “relevant student entities or groups” to be able to “review, edit and contribute to the drafting process” of the surveys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once conducted, the results must be widely shared and publicized to the student body, the organization said. Jonathan Abboud, the Associated Students President in 2014, criticized the university for not widely publicizing the survey results in an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/survey-reveals-campus-comfort-level/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Nexus after they were first released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several of the demands are also centered around safety and assisting survivors; the organization is demanding that the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) office has its funding increased to be able to put on more workshops and to hire two “institutionalized” prevention education coordinators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current prevention education coordinator is funded by a grant that C.A.R.E. received in fall 2018, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway. Ulloa said the goal of this demand was to build upon the work the current prevention education coordinator is doing and make the position permanent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final demand on the list calls for “mandatory faculty research on perpetrators, not just survivors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that demand also came from a UCSB staffer, who is currently conducting research on survivors of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to kind of shift the focus to perpetrators, and why are they doing that,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That demand is specifically is shifting towards acknowledging rape culture,” Ulloa added. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The board includes an undergraduate and graduate representative from each UC campus, except UC San Francisco, which only has graduate students and thus only a graduate student representative. The board is tasked with meeting regularly to advise the system-wide office on Title IX policy changes and to provide student input on the office’s decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of publication, the system-wide Title IX Office and UC Office of the President Media Relations staff did not respond with information about whether the graduate position remains vacant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Reynolds noted that the timing of her appointment is particularly important in light of recent sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795293000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRkktG4x3EpTr6IfWY69YOkBQAow\">allegations</a> against fraternity members during Fall Quarter of 2019 and the subsequent campus <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795295000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsZSIXhGlRx0Nt7lrhQJT9fY0bRA\">response</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, we’re at a very heightened time with regard to discourse around sexual assault and sexual harrassment [at UCSB] … so I think it’s really important that we use that discourse not just to bring awareness to these things and to talk about them, but also to provide tangible change that can prevent future instances,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, especially because I know of a lot of personal stories of students who have or have not gone to [the] Title IX [office] because they feel that the Title IX system is very backlogged, and it can just be extremely frightening to go to Title IX as it is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Reynolds served as the policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) and currently serves as its director, bringing the experience to her role as the undergraduate representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the first projects I had was when the Department of Education released their proposed changes to the federal Title IX document, and my job was to read over that hundred-page legal document and condense it,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes to Federal Title IX policy were first proposed in November 2018 by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and would </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">req</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uire “presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process” and a live cross-examination of survivors among other changes, according to the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xXna0hJncvtIYtY4cFhcSfOIUg\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live cross-examination during the judicial process of a Title IX investigation would mean that survivors would be in the same room as potential perpetrators, allowing cross-examination through the potential perpetrators’ lawyer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It [is] very invasive and potentially retraumatizing, I remember that was one that I specifically had a problem with,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Reynolds, it was important this year more than ever that UCSB had representation on the student advisory board, because she expects the Department of Education to make a decision about whether or not to implement the proposed federal Title IX changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Title IX Student Advisory Board was first <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7uvwSiRXwKb9VOKubgI5ZjjybBw\">created</a> in November 2017 under the first system-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty. In January 2018, Mariah Tanaka and Jennifer Selvidge were appointed as the undergraduate and graduate representatives to the board, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summer 2018, Tanaka resigned, leaving the undergraduate position open and Selvidge as the only UCSB representative on the board. She later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">resigned</a> in November 2018 following a disagreement between her and system-wide Title IX leadership over comments made to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) over proposed policy changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since November 2018, UCSB has had no representation on the board. That December, GSA voted to boycott the board over the treatment of Selvidge and the lack of power in appointing its own candidate, since the system-wide office has final say over appointees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board has continued to operate over the past year without any UCSB representation. All UC representatives on the board ended their yearlong terms in the beginning of the 2019-20 academic year, so the Title IX office has had to work over Fall Quarter 2019 to not only fill long-lasting UCSB vacancies, but also new vacancies created at all of the other UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Reynolds, it is vital that all UC campuses are represented in decision-making, not only regarding Title IX but in all UC policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are the ones that are paying for these services and the people that are paid by the UC system, we’re paying for them,” Reynolds said. “So it’s important that we know exactly what that money is being used for, and that it’s a very transparent process and it’s not under some sort of blanket or that people don’t know what’s going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full board will meet for the first time on Jan. 17 at UCOP’s office in Oakland. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

That’s just my environment,” he said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But neither of those things happened. Through perseverance and mentorship, he reshaped his destiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios, 42, is now a professor in the sociology department at UC Santa Barbara and the subject of a new documentary called “The Pushouts,” which traces through 25 years of his life and his work with a youth center in Watts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Rios studies underprivileged youth with upbringings similar to his own. Akin to finding a cure for a disease, Rios said “there is no silver bullet” in solving the problem of underprivileged youth and social disparities. But after 15 years of research, he said he has noticed a pattern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need a Yoda in life, right?” Rios said. “You want to have someone to turn to when you’re having a rough time and you want someone to turn to when you need an answer to a question that’s difficult to answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But for many of us, we might not have that Yoda.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a long time, Rios himself didn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one day, while sitting in a high school computer science class, his teacher, Flora Russ, extended him an offer he had never been given before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Russ] would always say to me when she saw me at school, ‘Victor, you might not be ready right now, but when you’re ready, I’ll be here for you,’” Rios said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was having a really tough time, when I hit rock bottom and my best friend had been killed and I was looking for that opportunity, I talked to her,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russ told him that she’d be glad to help, but he had to put in the work to make it happen. At the end of high school, Rios graduated on time and went on to receive his bachelor’s degree at California State University, East Bay and later attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios said Russ was different because “she cared for the whole person.” She enabled him to consistently spend time in school instead of on the streets and would “even go to my house and look for me and ask how I was doing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His personal experience with Russ cemented his belief in the importance of using guidance as a key for success. Along with empathy, which Rios described as “step one” to supporting students, the role of a teacher and education system should not only tell students how to succeed but also show them, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios finds that the education system has a habit of pushing students aside that can’t keep up, leaving them stuck where they are. Instead, Rios believes that every student should have the power to control their education without the threat of being told “you’re not ready. You’re no longer part of this career trajectory.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This style of education is otherwise known as mastery learning, according to Rios, in which students are encouraged and supported in their studies by using tools and resources provided to them to achieve their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastery learning contrasts traditional classes, Rios said, where “the first thing you hear from a professor is, ‘Welcome everyone. Half of you are going to fail this class,’” leading to student drop out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But using the label “dropout” puts blame in the wrong place, according to Rios. Instead, he uses the term “pushout” to better address the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we label a kid a dropout, it puts all the blame on them, ignoring whatever issues the student may have,” Rios told NBC. “Pushout is a better term, because it forces schools and educators to think about who they are failing, and what they can do about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If educators encouraged more than discouraged, Rios believes students would experience a system that supports them at their lowest and lends a hand when they’ve been knocked down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example is in the classroom, where Rios said students’ academic outcomes are increased when teachers hone in on the emotional side of their students, which can take as little as five minutes per class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education really has to be, from kindergarten all the way to college, an experience where you feel as a student that someone’s got your back. That someone is feeling what you’re going through and respecting what you’re going through,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a professor, Rios does just that and supports students in the same manner he said Russ supported him: with acceptance and empathy. When students approach him for help, Rios acknowledges that he’s not a “mental health expert,” but as a mentor, will always do what he can. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have a college student come to you and say, ‘I’m feeling a little broken inside,’ and kind of brush it off — you can’t do that,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of [my] best therapeutic moments have not been with mental health experts, professionals or therapists. My best mental health moments have been with my mentors, with my Yodas and with my guides.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, Rios, alongside a handful of other professors, began hosting “midnight office hours” in Isla Vista to offer students an outlet for support. The idea came out of empathy, according to Rios — he and his colleagues wanted to support students at a time when emotions were at a high and hope was at a low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students would get a kick out of it because some of them would show up drunk with tequila bottles in their hand. They’d call me by my last name … and we just sat there, a group of professors, and talked to students,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of them, though, you could tell they were lonely. They were roaming the streets of Isla Vista on their own, sober. But [they] just needed someone to talk to,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger level, Rios would like to see society move away from some of its “punitive” qualities and opt for more compassionate methods, such as restorative justice and giving students second chances. In turn, Rios envisions a society where people are more empathetic to one another’s struggles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his own life experiences in mind, Rios said he is dedicated to helping others go about their lives in a way that makes them feel supported — and never alone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My noble purpose is to help those that are suffering and struggling to find a way out, and then have them go and help others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we build a more compassionate world.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-91925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling was the first female chancellor in the entire UC system. </span><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to serving as the chancellor from 1987 to 1994, Uehling was chancellor of the University of Missouri, Columbia and worked at various universities around the country, including Roger Williams College, Illinois State University and the University of Oklahoma, according to a campus memo sent out by Chancellor Henry T. Yang on Jan. 7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As UC Santa Barbara’s fourth Chancellor, she provided steady and able leadership at a time of both economic challenges and rapid growth,” Yang said in the memo. “She emphasized diversity and academic excellence, and is credited with the development of the campus’s first 15-year Long Range Development Plan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus flag was lowered to half-staff on Jan. 8 to honor her memory, Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling was the first female chancellor in the entire UC system. Steven Elzer ‘88, who was the news editor of the Daily Nexus when Uehling was inaugurated, recounted the excitement that came along with her inauguration, but also the turmoil that encompassed the campus at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were very excited about [the first female chancellor]. She was an extraordinary leader,” Elzer said. “There was a lot of politics on the campus at that time. There were a lot of different factions that were divisive. It was a very raucous time in the history of the campus for sure. And she did everything she could to try to unify the deep divides that were rumbling over campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a previous Nexus article from 1986, Uehling’s predecessor — Chancellor Robert Huttenback — resigned following misuse of state funds to improve his home, including a hefty $104,000 renovation to his kitchen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Laurence Iannaccone, the chair of the Academic Senate in 1994, she was instrumental in the construction of many buildings on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She came to a campus that was building poor and program rich. A significant building program has been one of her major contributions to UCSB,” Iannaccone wrote when Uehling announced her retirement, according to the memo sent out by Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we are still short of adequate space, Chancellor Uehling will leave behind a solid plan for our long-term physical development — a plan that will carry the campus into the 21st Century. Another noteworthy mark of the Uehling era here at UCSB is the expansion of the School of Engineering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling also managed to restore trust in the Office of the Chancellor, following a tumultuous time of corruption during Huttenback’s term, Elzer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She put a lot of herself and a lot of effort into rebuilding the campus’ image and the stolen integrity in the Office of the Chancellor in a time that needed that,” Elzer added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had the best interest of the campus at heart and understood her unique role at the time in the history of the campus and then doing everything she could to do it right.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 10, 2:13 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Chancellor Henry T.

But in a new deal with Hawaii County, made on Dec. 26, protestors have instead agreed to move aside and unblock the access road, Hawaii News Now reported. The protestors will still remain at the site.</p>\n<p>Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said in a letter to protesters that “there will be no attempt to deliver construction equipment to Maunakea anytime soon.” Additionally, he added that “State and County agencies and law enforcement agencies will agree to stand down… there will be no attempt to remove [the] protector’s encampment.”</p>\n<p>The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians who claim it is desecrating Mauna Kea, believed to be one of the most sacred areas in all of Hawaii, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p>\n<p>The decision to halt construction came from the TMT International Observatory LLC (TMT) over safety concerns for workers and protestors, according to a statement from Gordon Squires, vice president for external relations for TMT.</p>\n<p>“The state and Hawaii County have not demonstrated that they are able to provide safe, sustained access to Maunakea for everyone,” Squire said. In the past six months alone, the Hawaiian Government has spent over $15 million on law enforcement for the site, the Star Advisor reported.</p>\n<p>Squire also noted that the organization is taking opposition to its project into account.</p>\n<p>“We are sensitive to the ongoing struggles of indigenous populations around the world, and we will continue to support conversations around TMT and the larger issues for which it has become a flashpoint,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Yang currently chairs the Thirty Meter Telescope’s board of governors, and his involvement faced backlash over the summer from students who opposed the project.</p>\n<p>In September, the UC Student Association (UCSA), which is comprised of every UC student government, wrote a letter opposing the telescope and the UC’s involvement in the project.</p>\n<p>In December, UCSB’s Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and the American Indian Student Association (AISA) brought Native Hawaiian protestors to campus to discuss their opposition to the project and urge students to support their cause.</p>\n<p>Despite the announcement about pausing TMT’s construction, Hawaiian elders and protest leaders said they were skeptical about TMT’s decision to pause construction after initially being given a deadline to vacate the area, according to the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>“[Governor Ige] making an obtuse statement that TMT has announced that they’re not coming for a while just doesn’t hold any water for us,” Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, a protest leader, told the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>Daevionne Beasley, the EVPSA of UCSB’s Associated Students, called the new announcements a “ploy” to remove protestors from Mauna Kea and clear the area for construction to resume.</p>\n<p>“When I had first heard [TMT was] halting the construction, I thought it was a good idea,” Beasley said, who has previously spoken to Yang about his involvement with TMT and is a co-signer of the UCSA letter.</p>\n<p>But combined with the fact that protesters have to move their tents to the side of the access road, Beasley believes “the government is trying to push [protesters] out so that [TMT is] able to go in and resume construction whenever they see fit.”</p>\n<p>Beasley also believes the protesters’ biggest point of contention with TMT — its location on historically sacred land — can be remedied by breaking ground in a new location that doesn’t impose on “someone else’s indigeneous land.”</p>\n<p>“The only solution in my head is to pause all development on the telescope until science is able to advance where [TMT doesn’t] have to build a telescope in an area where it would affect indigenous people,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Plans are in place to have a grand opening in January with students, staff and faculty to celebrate the new space, according to Katie Maynard, sustainability coordinator for the UCSB Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising center offers the assistance of Peer Advisors on Food Security and CalFresh Advocates; the advisors and advocates are peer mentors who “can advise students on resources related to food security, housing security, and other programs to help students in meeting their basic needs,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff at the center can also help students apply for the CalFresh Program, a federally funded program designed to help low-income individuals “add to their budget to put healthy and nutritious food on the table,” according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full list of stores where CalFresh benefits are accepted, including the Arbor and most grocery stores, can be found on the Food Security and CalFresh Advocates </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/calfresh\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said the center and its staff are funded through two sources: the State General Fund and  a subcontract from </span><a href=\"https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/higher-ed-subcontractors.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSU Chico</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps support UCSB’s CalFresh program. However, the funding for the center’s physical space comes from UCSB’s Department of Geography, according to Gary Lawrence, director for University Center and Events Center administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said he was first contacted about the vacant space by Melissa Fontaine, the geography department’s food security coordinator, on July 3, Maynard and Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services and member of the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Their goal] fit with the AS Food Bank and their mission to address the food security issues of UCSB students,” Lawrence said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease agreement was signed on Sept. 23 and extends through June 20, 2020; the Department of Department agreed to pay $3 per square foot, for a total of $1230 per month for 410 square feet. When the private office in the space – </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently occupied</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE) – becomes available, the space will increase by 80 square feet, increasing the cost to $1470 per month, according to Lawrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location offers a lot of student traffic, along with “close proximity” to other student services already in the UCen such as the Associated Students Food Bank and the Community Housing Office, Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This location allows us to co-locate our services in a central place that is easy for students to access,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

which gives students an understanding behind the processes important to the climate system. <em>Nexus file photo </em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Patty Murray, the undergraduate advisor for the geography department, approximately five or six students switch into the geography major every quarter. The new emphasis fills a gap in the major, according to Murray, so geography students interested in oceanography now can focus on the physical aspects of marine science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was no major on campus that focused on [that],” said Timothy DeVries, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, who helped to create the new emphasis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ocean plays a huge role in the Earth’s climate systems, so understanding ocean science is crucial for understanding the causes and effects of climate change,” DeVries added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new emphasis focuses on the fundamental aspects of the way the ocean works, which gives students an understanding behind the processes important to the climate system, according to DeVries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murray said that many students across several departments had expressed interest in the emphasis after taking a popular physical oceanography class that UCSB offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just for that one class, physical oceanography, the interest is there from many students in many different departments who are looking for that particular course knowledge,” Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ll have students come from other majors and say, ‘I wish I had discovered this major earlier.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new emphasis requires one upper-division class in physical oceanography, three classes focusing on oceanography and marine systems and three classes focused on climate and earth system science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lower-division requirements are the same as for the regular geography bachelor of science, which includes classes such as physics, chemistry, math and lower-division geography courses, according to DeVries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for this emphasis to be recognized, it had to go through an extensive approval process, beginning with the creation of a new major sheet, Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our upper-division classes for this degree emphasis were redesigned specifically to encompass oceanography, climate and earth systems, geographical techniques and statistical analysis. And all of those areas had to be defined specifically with the applicable courses on the new major sheet. So that was done departmentally,” Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the department created the degree emphasis, faculty in both the geography department and external departments such as marine biology and earth science took a vote to approve it, Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After emphasis was approved by both the geography department chairs and department faculty, it was submitted to the College of Letters and Science, who looked over the major to see if it met the college’s standards for major sheets and majors, Murray said. Afterward, it went to final approval with the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, in all, we probably spent about a year preparing with all the approval processes that we had to go through and then we were first able to offer this fall of 2019,” Murray said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murray hopes that the new emphasis will attract a wide variety of students. “We’re sort of shouting it from the rooftops,” Murray said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/","id":3346,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[3345,3344,3343],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | UCSB Rallies in Solidarity with UCSC Graduate Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-12-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UCSC-Strike_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UCSC-Strike_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSC graduate students are striking indefinitely until the university agrees to a Cost of Living Adjustment of an additional $1,412 a month.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Friday, UC Santa Barbara students gathered in front of Cheadle Hall to rally in solidarity with UC Santa Cruz graduate students, who are <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/ucsc-workers-withholding-final-grades-during-strike/2193182/\">striking indefinitely</a> until the university agrees to a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) of an additional $1,412 a month.</p>\n<p>The rally was organized by UCSB’s Graduate Student Association, which called upon UCSC to “immediately pay the Cost of Living Adjustment” in a Facebook event for the UCSB rally.</p>\n<p>“Many of us at UC Santa Barbara share the experience of being paid poverty wages for our academic labor in the face of exorbitant, ever-skyrocketing rent, and thus also struggle to make ends meet,” the description of the Facebook event stated.</p>\n<p>Dozens of UCSB students also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaJ4ODy8Hnb_8GWkmXThZfyAheURzT_ekbvuGLTfGGsfuU6A/viewform\">signed a petition</a> in support of the UCSC strike.

The backlash mainly took shape in the form of student-created petitions that circulated earlier this summer, asking Yang to step down from his role as chair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the speakers, Hawaiian activist Laulani Teale, emphasized that the crux of the conflict between Native Hawaiians and TMT is a matter of consent, as the developers of TMT are operating on land where many people native to it were not given the chance to approve the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation continued, Pisciotta moved on to address a common accusation the protestors faced, that by standing against TMT, Native Hawaiian protestors are also standing against science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nobody’s against science,” Pisciotta said. “The science was asking us, ‘What is our alternative [to building TMT]?’ But that question doesn’t belong to us. It actually belongs [to those working on the telescope].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How can you build something 18 stories high, [with a] stadium-size footprint and not frustrate the endangered species and the land and the water of Mauna Kea? So the question now becomes ‘How does science innovate to find a better solution that doesn’t do that?”’ she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July, dozens of Hawaiian elders were arrested for obstructing Mauna Kea’s only access road, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/mauna-kea-protest.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including Liko Martin, the “Bard of Aloha ‘Aina,” who attended Tuesday’s town hall. Martin spoke, sang and played guitar to the town hall’s attendees, performing several songs in which he wrote about Hawaii’s occupation by the U.S. government and the proposed development of TMT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin compared his time in the Hawaiian courthouse after he was arrested for protesting to being on an “auction block,” with a frenzy of lawyers vying to represent the elders as they entered the courthouse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was 33 of us [arrested]. The night before we went in there … I got the feeling [that] tomorrow we’re going to be on the auction block,” Martin said. “That’s exactly how it came down. All these attorneys are running around like, ‘We’ll take this one!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was like throwing my fishing hook in [the courthouse]. I didn’t even have to put any bait on it,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 13 other telescopes on Mauna Kea, but none as expensive as TMT, which is estimated to cost over a billion dollars, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times Reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; $300 million of the funding will be provided by the UC and Caltech, partially funded through a $200 million donation from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gordon+and+betty+moore+foundation+tmt&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS791US791&amp;oq=gor&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4j69i60l2.1253j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foundation’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees are not used as part of TMT’s funding, according to Claire Doan, UC Office of the President spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If completed, TMT will provide images 12 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/thirty-meter-telescope-will-be-most-powerful-eye-sky\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction on the telescope, however, won’t be complete until at least 2030, assuming construction begins in 2020, Teale said.

in the area between Goleta and Santa Barbara. Evacuated residents were directed to the Goleta Valley Community Center at 5679 Hollister Ave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classes for the remainder of the week were cancelled at 10:44 a.m. on Tuesday in an email sent by Chancellor Yang, but the fire “poses no threat to our campus,” with no evacuations planned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday at 11:00 a.m., local officials held a press conference at Earl Warren Showgrounds to provide an update on the status of the Cave Fire. According to Harris, the Cave Fire is burning “under some of the toughest firefighting conditions anywhere in the world,” a product of an intense dry season and low humidity index. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Fire Unit Chief Scotty Jalpert noted that the firefighting resources used to combat the Cave Fire have come “from Monterrey to San Bernardino.” Despite the prediction of rain in the coming days, “it’s not over yet,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santa Barbara County Battalion Chief Anthony Stornetta, operations to “box in” the fire began this morning, when multiple fixed wing aircraft were deployed to suppress the fire and form a perimeter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown noted that over 5,400 people have been evacuated as a result of the Cave Fire and will likely remain evacuated through today. According to a tweet sent out by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office at 11:44 a.m. on Tuesday, evacuation orders “for the areas West of Patterson to Fairview and North of Cathedral Oaks” have been lifted but all others remain in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caltrans </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaltransD5/status/1199344012768890881\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday that Highway 154 remains closed, and that drivers should expect increased traffic on Highway 101, particularly due to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students still on campus and in Isla Vista reported seeing ash on the ground and the air smelling smoky, recalling memories of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/in-photos-ucsb-students-bike-through-ash-prepare-for-finals-amid-socal-fires/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when air quality was deemed “unhealthy” during dead week in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourair.org/todays-air-quality/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">air quality</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is considered “good” in Santa Barbara and “moderate” in Goleta, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District issued an </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OurAirSBC/status/1199372164639539200/photo/1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">air quality warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the county on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m., writing that smoke and ash from the fire were affecting the local air quality and that “conditions may continue over the next several days.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The warning cautioned residents — particularly people with heart or lung disease, older adults, pregnant women and children — from spending time outdoors, and recommended wearing N95 masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct Relief, a global humanitarian organization based in Santa Barbara, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DirectRelief/status/1199354963673014272\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it would have N95 masks available to the public at its headquarters at 6100 Wallace Becknell Road between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday.

Pardall Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County spokesperson Gina DePinto announced early Tuesday morning that the county had declared a local emergency earlier in the night in response to the Cave Fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors ratified the proclamation at an emergency meeting Tuesday morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declaring an emergency will allow the county to “utilize all the resources necessary to respond to the damage caused by the local emergency” as well as “receive any needed funding through the California Disaster Assistance Act,” the local emergency declaration, signed by the director of emergency services, states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted California access to federal funds early Tuesday morning in order to aid firefighting efforts after the state submitted a request for a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fire Management Assistance Grant, the agency said in a </span><a href=\"http://fema.gov/news-release/2019/11/26/fema-fire-management-assistance-granted-cave-fire\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the time of the request, the fire threatened 15,000 homes in the unincorporated areas of Santa Barbara County, with a population of 85,000,” the press release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fire also threatened 10 businesses, a county fire communication center, power transmission lines, and Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FEMA Region IX regional administrator decided that the fire “threatened such destruction as would constitute a major disaster,” according to the release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The grant provides federal funding for up to 75% of “eligible” firefighting costs, which includes “expenses for field camps, equipment use, materials, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities attributed to fighting the fire,” the release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s local emergency declaration also asks that California Governor Gavin Newson declare a “state of emergency” because of the Cave Fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cave Fire is causing conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within Santa Barbara County,” DePinto said in a press release, adding that the fire is “advancing toward majority population areas in the cities of Santa Barbara and Goleta, and unincorporated areas of the county.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These conditions are beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment and facilities of the combined forces of the county’s Operational Area to combat. Additional resources have been ordered from out of the area, which have been arriving all evening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the fire is “threatening” Southern California Edison’s main transmission lines, which south Santa Barbara County depends on to receive power, and that some in the county have already been experiencing “periodic” power outages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista and the UCSB campus were not affected by power outages, although several students reported seeing lights flickering both in Isla Vista and on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 6:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, Santa Barbara City College </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SantaBarbaraCC/status/1199333502136676356\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it was canceling all classes for Tuesday and Wednesday and closed all of its campuses “out of an abundance of caution” because of the Cave Fire. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will be updated. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Life website. <em>Courtesy of Shoreline Website</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), facilitated the initial change from paper information to OrgSync and now from OrgSync to Shoreline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he first started working at UC Santa Barbara in 2007, “the department was all paper — registration was on paper, financial transactions were paper, nothing but paper,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a simple online event-planning form that we used that we actually had to do in person with every single organization creating an event, but it was developed in the ‘90s, so the functionality was really limited,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL then recognized a need for “a 21st-century system for student engagement” to digitize its process, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When OSL first began to pursue digitized options, OrgSync was one of three software choices reviewed by OSL. As time went on, OrgSync was no longer properly serving the evolving needs of students from feedback the OSL had received, Ashlock said. Student organizations had trouble navigating the website and were not able to create their own sites, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSL began to look at different software options and found a program called CampusGroups, also known as Shoreline, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a student-engagement platform that doesn’t just serve the OSL, but it also serves departments in Student Affairs and across the campus and therefore is an engagement platform for every student,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from OrgSync to Shoreline had its fair share of problems, such as delays in shifting the information of organizations to the new platform, Ashlock said. The data renewal process took place last spring through a Google Form where current organizations could sign up and update their contact information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unfortunately, we lost information for about 10 organizations,” Ashlock said. “We had reached out to them on multiple occasions to invite them to complete full registration in Shoreline and up to nearly 400 organizations have. We did mention that we did contact those organizations and say, ‘You have this much time to save your website data from OrgSync, but you will lose it otherwise.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said another issue limited the number of graduate students listed, but the problem has since been fixed and graduate students are now included in the database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the faculty and staff are being loaded onto the platform this week as well, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL is also working toward using Shoreline to create a more functional check-in system for when a group hosts an event. Ashlock estimates that this new feature will be ready at the end of the quarter when OSL is finished with data integration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new check-in system will offer five different ways to sign into an event, depending on the event organizer, who can enable whichever option they choose, according to Ashlock. Students will be able to check in with a QR code provided through the Shoreline app or they can scan a QR code posted at the event; alternatively, they can scan, swipe or tap their Access Card for entry, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a lot of versatility and all of those options can exist side by side,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone with an Access Card is going to be able to check-in and keep a log of events that they’ve attended.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shoreline website is currently available online for students, and an app is in development, which will provide access to student groups and student resources, such as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho On-Line Data (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.O.L.D.), GauchoSpace and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Accounts Receivable Collections (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BARC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s basically an instant messaging platform that merges student engagement and student resources,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we developed this app, we’re looking to create, even if it’s not just a single app, a more seamless environment where students can really go and get all the information they need in an efficient way.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article <span class=\"__in\">appeared</span> on page 5 of the Nov. 21, 2019 <span class=\"__in\">print</span> <span class=\"__in\">edition</span> of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/orgsync-switches-to-shoreline-allowing-student-organizations-more-functionality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/orgsync-switches-to-shoreline-allowing-student-organizations-more-functionality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/orgsync-switches-to-shoreline-allowing-student-organizations-more-functionality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/orgsync-switches-to-shoreline-allowing-student-organizations-more-functionality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/orgsync-switches-to-shoreline-allowing-student-organizations-more-functionality/","id":3333,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[3332,3331,3330],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":9,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
