Internal Vice President Angela Lau discussed the Student Health Board’s plan to reduce financial aid for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance.</p>\n<p>“What they want to do is reduce financial aid packages for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance. Currently around 50 percent of students waive Gaucho health insurance,” said Lau. “However they don’t account for the fact that currently, to be a student at UCSB you are required to have health insurance.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, the Student Health Board’s new plan will financially hurt students, many of whom struggle to pay for tuition and school expenses already.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really make sense to reduce financial aid for not having Gaucho Health Insurance when you’re making every student have it,” Lau said, “Essentially that means that they’re penalizing students for not using the Gaucho Health Insurance brand by reducing their financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting Senator Zach Goulhiane of the UCen Governance Board reported that changes are being made to the campus mail system so that first-year students living in the Santa Catalina dorms will have to collect their mail at the UCen post office.</p>\n<p>“They’re planning on spending $93,000 to re-do pretty much all the P.O. boxes for the freshmen so all the FT mailboxes, all the University-owned mailboxes will be moved here [the UCen],” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>According to Goulhaine, the move is directed to increase foot traffic around UCen businesses and to simplify mail distribution.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get more traffic into the UCen so that more people will go around the bookstore and whatnot buying stuff here,” Goulhiane said, “And that way they centralize all the mail because now apparently it takes them a while to send it out.”</p>\n<p>Also during meeting, A.S. Recycling Program member Sam Breyfogle outlined the organization’s proposal to update recycling bin signs to reflect a new comingled recycling program that aims to provide specific instructions for waste management. The proposal is seeking funds from The Green Initiative Fund, a student-supported fund that funds eco-friendly projects on campus.</p>\n<p>“They [bins] were installed about 20 years ago. They currently say ‘newspapers, aluminum, plastic,’ and ‘glass’ as well as ‘trash,’” Breyfogle said. “We’d like to get signs that say ‘comingled recycling’ and underneath that a sign that lists out what can be recycled.”</p>\n<p>Breyfogle also said the organization wants to upgrade the BigBelly trashcans on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to buy new bins for the interiors of the berthas,” Breyfogle said, “Many of the bins have holes bit through by rodents causing them to leak and make a complete mess of the interior.”</p>\n<p>After further discussion surrounding Gaucho Health Insurance, the Senate heard from A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli about updates surrounding the iClicker rental program.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli explained that the goal is to make iClickers free for students to rent, but there will be a suggested $5 donation upon returning the iClicker to keep the program sustainable.</p>\n<p>“Based off our research, students are highly inclined if not really ecstatic to provide up to $5 to the association for providing such a service if it meant that that money was going to go to expanding such a service,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli addressed the specific concern of the $7 re-registration fee for students on used iClickers and suggested that donations generated from the $5 program could reduce the fee. Khazaieli also suggested potentially “striking a deal” with iClicker to get reduced rates.</p>\n<p>A.S. will be holding a finance meeting on Monday to “secure funding for the program,” according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<p>“If revenues are generated from the iClicker program … that money can go towards subsidizing this,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with senators passing two resolutions in support of a tuition hike op-ed and a BigBelly label and bin upgrade.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the February 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Photographs published in his earlier book<em> Juvenile in Justice</em> have been on exhibit nationwide and used as a tool for advocates for juvenile justice system reform. Images from his new book are currently on display on the first floor of the library.</p>\n<p>Ross, who previously worked as a photographer for <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> and the<em> New York Times</em>, said he wants his exhibits and books to spark change in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a judge; I’m not a probation officer. I’m an artist; I’m a human being,” Ross said. “I decided with my work I’m going to use art as a weapon.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids. – Art professor and photographer Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Ross, one of the underlying issues within the juvenile justice system is that “as a society, we bully kids.”</p>\n<p>“If you bully someone who is a person of color, you might get some pushback, you might be sued,” Ross said. “Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while there have been improvements made in the system since the publication of <em>Juvenile in Justice</em> three years ago, the situation for incarcerated girls has worsened.</p>\n<p>“The population of girls increases in relation to boys and girls have unique problems,” Ross said. “That’s why I published the book on girls to focus exactly on what’s going on with them.”</p>\n<p>Ross shared dozens of examples of his images, including one comparison between a detention cell in El Paso, Texas to one at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>“This holds the worst terrorist in the world. This holds a ten-year-old,” Ross said. “What’s the difference between the two? Who has the window? The terrorist, not the kid. I start presenting images like this to state and federal authorities . . . I start creating a bit of a buzz.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60470\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60470\" data-attachment-id=\"60470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984185\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60470\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=335%2C223\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"335\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Ross said the plan to eliminate the use of solitary confinement at the Rikers Island complex, an institution he described as “nefarious,” is a move in the right direction, but that he will believe in substantial change “when he sees it.”</p>\n<p>“For four years I’ve been trying to get into Rikers and I’ve been told by the head of detention . . . by [Mayor] Bloomberg, by [Mayor] De Blasio, by judges, ‘You’ll never get into Rikers in this lifetime,’” Ross said. “New York State and North Carolina are the two states that default and have kids automatically tried or looked at as adults. It’s a terrible system and I hope Rikers gets better.”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, while solitary confinement is an issue of national importance, it also pervades the local justice system in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The state is supposed to act as the parent when the parent can’t,” Ross said. “But these are the closets that we put kids in. They’re under the guise of administrative segregation, time-out rooms and desensitization rooms. In Santa Barbara, I interviewed a kid that was in there for three weeks.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while visiting a detention center in Monterey Park, Calif., he came to understand that the large percentage of incarcerated youths are victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“I asked the director what percentage of girls had been sexually abused when they come here,” Ross said. “He said ‘What percentage? Every one of them. All 88 girls in our custody have been sexually abused’ and then he said ‘and most of the boys.’ They’re all victims of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Jessica Sparks, an assistant with the Davidson Library Outreach Department and a third-year English and Renaissance studies major, said she was shocked by the sheer number of incarcerated youth that Ross’s project has revealed have been abused.</p>\n<p>“I thought it wasn’t that many, but hearing it was all of them it brings a whole new level of depth to the pictures downstairs,” Sparks said.</p>\n<p>According to Ross, many children in the juvenile justice system are suffering the consequences of their parents’ poor decisions.</p>\n<p>“A girl that was doing 35 years — she murdered somebody,” Ross said. “She was high on meth. Her mother gave her meth when she was seven. This girl has already served about ten years . . . she was sentenced at 14 and is going to serve until she’s 34.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community. These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result. – Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ross said one director of a detention center shared with him the difficulty of protecting transgender youth within the system.</p>\n<p>“Often they are thrown out of their family and have to respond with survival — sex to eat, to sleep, to live,” Ross said. “The director said [of a male to female transgender youth] ‘If I put her in with the girls, she’ll be hurt. If I put her in with the boys, she’ll be killed. I keep her in isolation, I know it’s against federal law . . . But she is not going to be killed on my watch.’”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, African American and Latino youths are at a higher risk of being tried as adults.</p>\n<p>“Latino youth are four time more likely to receive an adult sentence for the same crime as white children,” Ross said. “African American youth are nine times more likely.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and communication double major Alexis Lin, who took an art class with Ross last Spring quarter, said it is a glaring issue that the majority of the incarcerated are of color.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of youth get stereotyped into certain categories and that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Ross said he often thought of the difference between his own children’s upbringing and that of incarcerated youth while visiting detention centers.</p>\n<p>“Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community,” Ross said. “These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Hector Sanchez Castaneda said he also thought of his family when he learned about the living conditions of incarcerated youth in America.</p>\n<p>“When I saw the pictures downstairs, on the first floor of the library, when I saw the little girl — she’s my sister’s age, eight-years-old,” Sanchez-Castaneda said. “It broke my heart to see a little girl like that with no family whatsoever to support her.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60469\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60469\" data-attachment-id=\"60469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1065%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1065,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984014\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60469\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-682x1024.jpg?resize=270%2C405\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?w=1065&amp;ssl=1 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art professor and photographer Richard Ross. <i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to Ross, communities are better off when detention centers are closed and resources are invested elsewhere in the community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been closing down a lot of these mass incarceration institutes, especially for kids,” Ross said. “We’ve turned a corner and crime hasn’t gone up . . . the data proves that the more you release kids and give resources to the community, the better the outcomes for kids and communities remain safe.”</p>\n<p>Ross said there are still significant changes that need to be made in the juvenile justice system and hopes his photos will play a part in communicating the need for reform.</p>\n<p>“What’s the common visual vocabulary: that if somebody sees a picture, you think about it,” Ross said. “I want to create that.

<em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two professors from McGill University and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies gave keynote lectures at the Mosher Alumni House to celebrate the opening of the Confucius Institute on campus yesterday.</p>\n<p>The first lecture, “Globalizing Regions: the Spread of Southeast Chinese Daoist Ritual Traditions to Southeast Asia,” was given by East Asian Studies Professor Kenneth Dean of McGill University. Immediately following Dean, Professor of Trade &amp; Economic Diplomacy at the Middlebury Institute and Institute for Trade and Commercial Diplomacy President Robert Rogowsky gave a lecture entitled, “U.S.-China Trade Policy: Productive Collaboration or Managed Rivalry?” Religious studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang began the meeting by giving a summary about what the opening of the Confucius Institute means for the university.</p>\n<p>“We will emphasis academics and research more than most Confucius institutes,” Yang said, “We still will be in the business of educating the public, promoting China studies, strengthening understanding of Chinese history, culture, society, religion, philosophy, literature, economics, and politics.”</p>\n<p>During the lecture Dean discussed the background of Southeast Asia’s cultural history presented his findings from his long-term ethnographic studies focused on Southeast China. According to Dean, ethnic communities with distinct dialects provide cultural benefits to its surrounding region.</p>\n<p>“The dialect communities provide a lot of strength and resources for communities,” Dean said.</p>\n<p>Afterward Rogowsky gave a lecture on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, highlighting economic issues brought about by China’s rapid industrialization.</p>\n<p>“The growth of the middle class in China and in particular Asia is huge,” Rogowsky said. “It’s good but is also somewhat problematic. Problematic in the sense that people in the middle class eat a lot more than people who are poor … so it increases the demand for food tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Vice Director of Confucius Institute Professor Lijuan Zhang ended the meeting with closing statements about the opening of the Confucius Institute and the value of its research.</p>\n<p>“[There is] lots of debate on Chinese issues but there is one consensus that I think everyone would agree,” Zhang said, “that it’s worth the research about China.”</p>\n<p>Second-year religious studies graduate student Sarah Veeck said she was interested in Dean’s analysis on the changes in the Putian plain over the last hundred years.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of depth. There also with the transnational connections continuing to impact local religion in China,” Veeck said. “I would be interested in dong long-term ethnographic study on a community that does rely on local temple associations to provide assistance for education, infrastructure projects, funerals for people who can’t afford them.”</p>\n<p>Yang said Dean offered a historical perspective of Fujian that maintained a locally-oriented account of its regional impact throughout Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>“Professor Rogowsky’s talk had a very powerful global perspective that really serves the global studies academic community here on campus,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the two keynote speeches illustrated the Confucius Institute’s as well as China’s “globally important” role on campus and in the world.</p>\n<p>“It’s a dynamically changing society.” Yang said. “All these global transnational problems, you need China on board. You need to engage with China. Just because you don’t agree on a few things doesn’t mean you cannot include China because China is a dynamic society. It can help the rest of the world a great deal.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60483\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60483\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/","id":2906,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2905,2904,2903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The direct remainder of around $600 was allocated toward attending sporting events other than the USA Nationals in Anaheim, which they are still competing in.</p>\n<p>According to Cheer co-Captain Nick Gorton-Bufano, the team reallocated funds to the Ontario trip due to injuries sustained by team members that prevented them from attending the Atlanta competition.</p>\n<p>“We lost six people to injury and personal family matters, so we could not go, so we would like to take the money that we would have used for hotels and put it towards a competition on March 7,” said Gorton-Bufano.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60442\" style=\"width: 374px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60442\" data-attachment-id=\"60442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-entertains-funding-requests/finance-board_will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=3475%2C2306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3475,2306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422899329\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60442\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=364%2C241\" alt=\"Will Tran/Daily Nexus\" width=\"364\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>EAP received $250; the Cotillion Dance Club received $1,175 to fund three dancing events at the Hub; the Film Studio received $750 for catering and snacks for an event on Feb. 20 in Pollock Theater and the Iranian Graduate Student Association received $1,300 for food for their New Year’s celebration, typically held on March 21.</p>\n<p>According to a speaker for the Iranian Graduate Student Association, the club had to change their event due to the week falling on the same dates as finals week leading into spring break.</p>\n<p>“We are also offering a culture show which includes dancing and like different traditional music performances also from our culture, so that is where our other money is going.

Representatives from the university, Shandong University, the City of Santa Barbara and the Consulate General of the Peoples Republic of China in Los Angeles were all present at the ceremony. The Institute is funded by the Office of Hanban, located in Beijing, China, with UCSB matching funds.</p>\n<p>Religious Studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang said she began the process of starting the Confucius Institute in 2010.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy to see that everything is finally in place,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the Confucius Institute would aid graduate students and faculty whose research involves Chinese Studies.</p>\n<p>“Our Confucius Institute will place a special emphasis not only on language teaching, but on research,” Yang said. “We will put a lot of the Confucius Institute’s energies and funds into promoting China Studies on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, more than half of the university’s international students come from China, and the new Confucius Institute will facilitate interaction between Chinese and American students.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to increase the synergy between International Students Studying at UCSB and our own students who have an interest in China,” Yang said. “We will try to hold social activities and scholarly lectures where we bring these two constituencies together.”</p>\n<p>Yang said collaboration between countries like China and the United States is necessary in order to take on global issues such as climate change, terrorism and economic inequality.</p>\n<p>“We have so many global problems that no country can solve,” said Yang. “We all have to come together and deal with our differences — graciously, politely, but persistently — and at the same time try to make stronger bridges so that we can understand each other better and ultimately work together to address these global issues.”</p>\n<p>Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Jian Liu said the Confucius Institute will teach students Chinese languages in order to facilitate communication between China and the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Language is a bridge connecting different countries and peoples,” Liu said. “Confucius Institute has become this for promoting the beautiful Chinese language.”</p>\n<p>Yang also spoke at the ceremony and said the Confucius Institute illustrates the university’s dedication to a global education.</p>\n<p>“Today as we watch the Confucius Institute on campus, we are creating another opportunity for UC Santa Barbara to facilitate cultural exchange, expand our commitment to global education, and extend new learning and research options to our students,” Yang said. “We feel very, very honored to be able to sign this agreement with Shandong University.”</p>\n<p>Chairman of the University Council for Shandong University Shouxin Li said the Confucius Institute on campus is distinct from others in the U.S. due to its academic collaboration with Shandong University in China.</p>\n<p>“Although there are many Confucius Institutes located around the United States, I can assure you that the University of California, Santa Barbara Confucius Institute is unique because it is established through the cooperation between UCSB and Shandong University — a University near the hometown of Confucius,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said he takes pride in the university’s strengths “in Chinese Language, history, living art, culture and society.”</p>\n<p>“We really hope in partnership with Hanban and our distinguished colleagues at Shandong University to build on these strengths and advance study, education and research in these areas for many years to come,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor pro tempore Gregg Hart said Santa Barbara has honored its Spanish history and is happy to see that it is now focusing on the knowledge of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to say that we’ve come to a place where we’re going to respect both historical traditions,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Matt Share, who is in his second year of studying Chinese, said he hopes the Confucius Institute will mean more Chinese language classes will be offered at the university.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the intro Chinese language courses are offered in a one-year sequence, so if you want to take Chinese and you’re at a certain level, but you miss that course because of a course conflict, you have to wait a whole year,” said Share.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chinese international student majoring in economics Xiaoke Ma performed at the ceremony on a Hulusi, a traditional instrument of the Yunnan province in southern China. She said the Confucius Institute would give her the opportunity to share her culture the campus community.</p>\n<p>“I could let my foreign friends know what the Confucius Institute is and I could show them some of my music, like what I did today,” Ma said. “The way I speak, the way I think — it’s really different from what you guys [American students] think.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Dean of the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University and editor-in-chief of China’s <em>Journal of Literature, History and Philosophy</em>, Professor Xuedian Wang said the institute is representative of “a great opportunity to make a commitment” to cultural enrichment.</p>\n<p>“I believe there is huge potential for our inter-cooperation,” Wang said, “So let’s work together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/","id":2903,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2902,2901,2900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hackathon Draws Participants, Sponsors From Across State","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hundreds of students from across the state participated in SB Hacks’ first annual UCSB Hackathon on Sunday to showcase projects they worked on throughout the weekend and to compete for prizes Th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60365\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60365\" data-attachment-id=\"60365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-5.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Students work for countless hours designing and creating projects.

During the workshops, programmers of all levels also had an opportunity to write online versions of the best-selling mobile game Flappy Bird.</p>\n<p>The event also featured special amenities for participants including free meals, Nerf gun competitions, meditation sessions and formal video game tournaments for console games such as Super Smash Bros and Halo.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60364\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60364\" data-attachment-id=\"60364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Several video game tournaments were held in a tent just outside the Corwin Pavilion.

He also introduced his program Cydia, an alternative to the Apple app store, and focused on its ability to customize devices with specific features not available in Apple’s app store.</p>\n<p>“Not everything is an app that could go in the app store in the first place … Cydia instead is about extensions and modifications,” Freeman said, “Cydia is a place where you can get custom looks for your phone, you can go and get new features … you can also make modifications inside of apps.”</p>\n<p>Third-year computer science major Andrew Dutcher said his team created a smartphone app allowing music from different playlists or tracks to start playing once you enter a designated geographical area.</p>\n<p>“You have a map on an Android phone, you make a circle, step into the circle in the real, physical world and music will play from one playlist,” Dutcher said. “Step out of the circle and music will play from another playlist. Step back in, it will play from the first playlist again.”</p>\n<p>According to Dutcher, the application his team created was inspired by video game programming.</p>\n<p>“The impetus for this problem is a 3D programmer in videogames. If you go from area A to area B, there will be a pop up and the music changes,” Dutcher said. “So you have theme music for areas. This is obviously useful to have music for different areas or for self-guided tours.

If we had more time, we’d be able to graph it and you’d see some oscillations that would reflect the rate of oxygen consumption in your blood.”</p>\n<p>West College electrical engineering major Robin Morales, one of Anderson’s teammates, and said he hopes the device can be made smaller, more portable and more practical for everyday use.</p>\n<p>“We did this so you can take it with you,” Morales said. “You don’t need to be in a hospital room or have a huge clunky device at home. … It interfaces with a computer; you can enjoy your hike and see how you did instead of constantly checking. …The components will get smaller and cheaper and then can get integrated with smart phones or even fitness watches.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the team’s project transcended winning a prize and that their creation and development of the app was what team members were most proud of.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t finished the software yet, so you know, we might win something,” Anderson said. “But we didn’t come here to win, we came here to learn something.”</p>\n<p>UCLA computer science major Dee Chen said his team created a portable paper piano that allows users a more affordable and accessible alternative to learning and playing the piano.</p>\n<p>“It’s sensing capacitants. Your body acts as a natural capacitant. So when you touch it, it sends a signal and we can measure that signal and then can play a sound off of that. It’s sort of like the touch screen on an iPhone,” Chen said. “There’s different notes, which activate from pressing your finger on the wires.”</p>\n<p>According to Chen, the piano costs less than $30 and will allow individuals who are unable to afford pianos to learn and play at an affordable price.</p>\n<p>“The second part of this is that let’s say you want some piano lessons without actually paying the price for them,” Chen said. “Well, if you press this one wire, it will send a signal to a computer to a different piano. So you could essentially teach someone how to play piano with only two of these paper pianos — you don’t need a real one.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60369\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60369\" data-attachment-id=\"60369\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Live music accompanied the hackathon as students wait and rest.

administrators announced Wednesday that UCSB has been named a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) due to the campus’ 25 percent Latino student population.</p>\n<p>Due to the recent recognition, the university will now compete for more funding for support services, faculty development and scientific equipment from the Department of Education. Total enrollment for the Latino student population count includes both full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students currently at the university.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics major Irlanda Martinez said it’s more common for community colleges and state schools to become HSI’s due to public schools’ tendency to be affordable.</p>\n<p>“Given the socio-economic factors most Latinas and Latinos face in the United States, a significant part of our community follows the community college route like me or attends a Cal State due to the more affordable prices of education there,” Martinez said. “Because of this, it is common for community colleges and Cal States to become HSI’s.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the university’s population has been rising, this year surpassing the 25 percent minimum to qualify for the HSI title.</p>\n<p>“Just this year, the Latina/o attendance at UCSB rose to approximately 27 percent, which automatically defined it as an HSI,” Martinez said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, this “automatic definition” is only for HACU and any additional funding would have to come from the Department of Education based on the percentage of students who receive financial assistance and an Educational and General Expenditures Requirement based on per capita expenditures.</p>\n<p>“Both of these requirements were not met by UCSB because we have students who are very well-off, and the averages are thrown off,” Martinez said in an email. “UCSB is in the process of waiving those requirements, which is likely to happen because it is somewhat rare for an institution at the level of UCSB to become defined as an HSI through the Department of Education.”</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of HACU John Moder said the Latino-serving organization was formed in response to the underrepresentation of Hispanics in academics.</p>\n<p>“We were founded by a group of colleges and universities that had large numbers of Hispanic students and realized that there was no organization that spoke for that institution,” Moder said. “So in 1986, that group created the first definition of a Hispanic serving based on enrollment.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger. – Professor of Chicana/o Studies Gerardo Aldana</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Moder, if the university accepts the title of HSI, it will have to increase its overall student involvement.</p>\n<p>“It is going to result in better services, better teaching … for all the students that are there,” Moder said, “So although we talked about it being a Hispanic Serving Institution, I don’t think you can really be Hispanic serving without also kind of upping your game for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Professor of Chicana/o Studies and Anthropology and Associate Dean of College of Creative Studies Gerardo Aldana said the recognition will allow more resources to be allocated to education and leadership skills development on campus.</p>\n<p>“HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger,” Aldana said. “To me, that is a very important message, especially as the demographics of California shift and the need for a diverse educated workforce and leadership increases.”</p>\n<p>According to Aldana, the Department of Chicana/o Studies is part of the university’s commitment to diversity reflected in the HSI status.</p>\n<p>“Our population of Chicana/o and Latina/o students has consistently increased across campus at the same time that our scholarship and academic rankings have increased,” Aldana said. “UCSB demonstrates that it is not one or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The event will be hosted by Santa Barbara Hacks, a student organization and is sponsored by Citrix, Cisco, Opengov, Microsoft, Intel, Smartstones and Major League Hacking, among others. SB Hacks is co-founded by fourth-year computer science majors Trevor Frese and Anshul Jain as well as third-year computer science major Benji Lampel.</p>\n<p>Geared towards undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students, the event is free for all participants and will provide participating hackers with free meals. Students with advanced knowledge in computing as well as beginners can attend the event and participants can attend in groups of up to four individuals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing. Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill. – SB Hacks co-founder and fourth-year computer science major Anshul Jain</p></blockquote>\n<p>Frese said the Hackathon will include smaller events to highlight the “Santa Barbara vibe,” such as morning yoga sessions and walks to the beach.</p>\n<p>“There’s a big focus in Santa Barbara on health and wellness as well, so that has been one of our focuses of the event,” Frese said. “Although it is a 36-hour event and it’s stressful for the hackers, we want them to have the right means to stay healthy. We’ve also just added a lot of activities to the event. We have video game tournaments, silent disco and a moonlight walk on the beach.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the team with the most creative and original project at the showcase will win the Grand Prize Bundle, which includes the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 and a $10,000 cash prize. Prizes will also be awarded to the winning groups in various challenges, such as Environmental Hack Challenge, Beginners Hack Challenge and Makeschool Best iOS App/Game Challenge.</p>\n<p>“Some groups work on challenges that they work on assigned by companies, while others come together to work on their own project that you’ve just never had the chance to make,” Lampel said. “At its heart it’s still a competition, and people are still there to compete for prizes. People are still trying to work on something to win, but there are a lot of ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The hackathon will give students the opportunity to develop ideas that they previously had not had the opportunity to create, Jain said.</p>\n<p>“You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing,” Jain said. “Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun. – SB Hacks co-founder and third-year computer science major Benji Lampel</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon will allow student groups to get critique and assistance from mentors hired by the company sponsors as well as to “meld brains with people we would never have met otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“Lots of companies will send mentors who specialize in certain systems,” Lampel said. “Because computer science is such a broad field of so many specific areas of study, it’s hard to teach someone one thing and say they are proficient computer scientists.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the hackathon is open to individuals with advanced knowledge in coding as well as to those with no previous experience in the field.</p>\n<p>“There are people who come to these events to learn how to code and we think that UCSB Hacks is definitely a great place for beginners to come and learn and meet people who are very experienced in the industry,” Lampel said, “but then have the opportunity to work with them also in a very safe cooperative learning environment.”</p>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon aims to highlight Santa Barbara as a location “on the map” of the tech industry as well as to show that it is “just how we do things here.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of starter communities in L.A., San Francisco, Silicone Valley and they’re all very big . . . I think the start-up community in SB is very different from the other places,” Lampel said. “We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/","id":2928,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2927,2926,2925],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Meeting Talks Lock-Ins, Supports IVTU","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate met in the Flying A Room at the UCen Wednesday night to discuss potential lock-in fees and resolutions including ones in support of President Barack Obama’s proposal t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60257\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60257\" data-attachment-id=\"60257\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/senate-meeting-talks-lock-ins-supports-ivtu/senate_lorenzo-basilio-1-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12.jpg?fit=1600%2C1203&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1203\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422534409\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12.jpg?fit=888%2C668&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60257\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-12-1024x770.jpg?resize=600%2C451\" alt=\"A.S.

Students and faculty also talked about the presence of undocumented students on campus and the positive influence immigrants have had on Santa Barbara’s economy.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sociology professor William Robinson said Obama has been known as the deportation president to many undocumented individuals, with more deportations occurring under his administration than any other, according to Robinson.</p>\n<p>“On the one hand he’s talking about the rights of immigrants and he’s giving temporary residency to some immigrants that meet certain conditions,” Robinson said. “Yet on the other hand, he’s deported more immigrants than any other president in about fifty to sixty years.”</p>\n<p>Robinson said immigrants to the U.S. have become the “scapegoat” for the multitude of financial and economic problems the country is currently facing, all of which are reflected in Obama’s immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“First, it’s generating a great humanitarian crisis for 12 million immigrants in the country and their families, and second, immigrants play an absolutely crucial role in sustaining the U.S., and for that matter the global economy,” Robinson said. “Third, these mass deportations without the due process is violation of international law.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, in order to fix what he calls the mass deportation issue in the U.S., the government must enforce a suspension on all raids and deportations of undocumented citizens. He also said undocumented individuals should have full labor, civil and political rights including automatic residency to undocumented citizens that have no record of criminal activity in the form of an easier pathway to citizenship than current exists.</p>\n<p>“This notion that you can divide the global population to citizen and immigrant is an outdated notion and one that is creating a new access of inequality worldwide,” Robinson said, “Inequality between citizens who have all these rights and immigrants who don’t have any of those rights.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them. – MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinson said it is vital that students understand issues surrounding mass deportation as urgent social and political issues that directly affect students and faculty at the university.</p>\n<p>“We have both documented and undocumented immigrants right here on campus, so they should be sensitive and aware of this issue and what’s at stake,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion Golash-Boza cited the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 as a starting point of racialized immigration policy in the U.S. and said that, fast-forwarding to the present day, even without a specific law stating that deportation is exclusive to a certain ethnic group, evidence shows that a majority of recent U.S. deportations have been of individuals of Latino descent.</p>\n<p>“Even though [the government] can’t directly create a law that says, ‘We aren’t going to target Latinos,’ it’s still able to happen,” Golash-Boza said. “The racial contours of immigration policy have changed, but it’s still constant.”</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said part of the MCC’s mission is to bring attention to issues involving underrepresented populations in America.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing our part here in our community by bringing in speakers to address these hard issues,” Thibdeau said. “Mass deportation is a very sensitive topic that can be very political, but we aren’t afraid of those type of topics.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out. – Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thibdeau also said the MCC wanted to make sure students are informed of the impact governmental policies can have on the nation.</p>\n<p>“We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them,” Thibdeau said. “There may be students here that aren’t citizens for example, or maybe their parents aren’t, so it’s a very important issue to make sure we’re all aware of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar said Golash-Boza’s discussion did a great job of explaining the essential role global capitalism has on minorities, although she also excluded some specific details.</p>\n<p>“I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out,” Salazar said. “For example, the Undocumented Youth Movement and different groups who have passed a lot of laws like the Trust Act and the new law AB60.”</p>\n<p>According to Salazar, students need to become more aware of the presence of undocumented students on campus as well as of the vital role the Santa Barbara immigrant community plays in supporting the local economy.</p>\n<p>“Whether [the students] are invested in the <em>News-Press</em> or other types of institutions, its foundation is immigrant community but at the same time its racism against the immigrant community,” Salazar said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Matthew Avalos said the discussion touched on his personal experiences as well as on the history of deportation he has learned from his classes at the university.</p>\n<p>“I am Hispanic myself and I have a lot of Hispanic friends, so I’ve heard stories of parents of friends who thought they could get deported,” Avalos said. “I just didn’t know that it had blown up to this extent and turned into such a massive problem.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-60180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of WorldCulture.org</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment and Student Academic Programs and Wellness Services Mary Jacob will begin serving as acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs on Feb. 2 following former Vice Chancellor Michael Young’s retirement, in which Young will be leaving behind his 25-year career as Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Jacob’s career with the Division of Student Affairs began in 1996, where she has began as Director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) and then later became the Senior Associate Dean and Executive Director of Student Academic Support Services. During her recently previously held position as Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services, she oversaw admissions, registrar, financial aid and early academic outreach.</p>\n<p>During Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s campus announcement on Jacob’s appointment last week, Yang said Jacob is well versed in the nuances and challenges of working within education and has received numerous campus recognitions during her career.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate Dr. Jacob’s longstanding dedication to our campus and especially our students,” Yang said. “Dr. Jacob has been deeply engaged in education-related activities at the national and international levels as well. She has been recognized with a UCSB Staff Citation for Excellence Award, and a Margaret T. Getman Service to Students Award.”</p>\n<p>OISS Director Simran Singh said he has worked with Jacob since 2002 and that her past work with the university has demonstrated that she is an excellent administrator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen her in action,” Singh said. “She’s … able to keep many different sets of needs in mind as she makes decisions.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position. – Former Vice Chancellor Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob said her time with OISS introduced her to a broad range of operations on campus that have prepared her to assume the duties involved with leading the Student Affairs Division.</p>\n<p>“During that time I got to understand how the Graduate Division operates and how Student Affairs operates, so that gave me a very broad training,” said Jacob.</p>\n<p>Jacob also said her time with the Student Academic Support Services and Enrollment Services gave her the necessary skillset and experience she will need to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I got greater in-depth experience within the division and on budget processes … through my work as the Executive Director and Associate Dean for Student Academic Support Services and in my current role as the Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young, who first met Jacob when she was a candidate for the position of Director of the OISS 19 years ago, said her career thus far at the university makes her an ideal fit for the position.</p>\n<p>“She’s had departmental experience as the department head, she’s had responsibility as a patrol point, she’s a senior administrator in the leadership of the Division and has been so for a number of years,” Young said. “I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position.”</p>\n<p>While her work with Young has helped prepare her to receive the chancellor’s offer to serve as Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Jacob said she was still surprised when she got the call to take on Young’s position.</p>\n<p>“[Young] has an executive group that works with him, and I’ve been a part of that group for a number of years, so I knew that he felt I was prepared if I was asked to be in this position on an interim basis,” Jacob said. “I was prepared if I were asked, but on another level I was surprised when I got a call from the chancellor.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students. – Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob also said Young has been an extraordinary leader and will be a hard act to follow.</p>\n<p>“He’s leaving enormous shoes behind to fill, and I’m going to do my best to fill them as much as I can in the time that I’m in the position,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>According to Jacob, she will continue to promote the “inclusive” campus climate and support services available to students during Young’s career.</p>\n<p>“I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young said he trusts Jacob to take on his role, but will be available with his expertise if she needs it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve told her that I won’t be around to interfere or meddle in her affairs, but I’m a phone call way or an email away for a point of view or more likely information — some detail that would be helpful to her,” Young said.</p>\n<p>According to Young, the campus community has a good future ahead of it with Jacob as its Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>“I’m prepared to be helpful in any way that she needs, but I can tell you that the campus — particularly the staff in Division of Students Affairs and the students that we serve through our programs and our initiatives — are well served with Mary Jacob as the Acting Vice Chancellor.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

World War 2. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of <em>New York Times</em> Eric Lichtblau spoke in Corwin Pavilion Monday night about how America became a safe haven for Hitler’s men in 1969 during the Cold War’s Operation Paperclip.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau presented recently discovered documents that discussed how Nazis were used as spies and scientists by the U.S. military and intelligence services in order to aid the race against the Soviet Union to reach the moon in 1969 via Operation Paperclip. The talk ended with a free book signing in honor of Litchtblau’s latest book entitled <em>The Nazis Next Door</em>, which took place at the entrance of Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>According to Lichblau, despite the American populous’ opposition to aiding Nazis, U.S. intelligence agencies undertook various secret efforts to protect them once they got to American soil.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that Nazis in America were paid with commodities for their work during what he called a “horribly difficult truth” in American history.</p>\n<p>“They were perceived as lazy, filthy, thieves, liars and double agents,” Lichtblau said. “But, they were still used by the U.S. in times of war and were offered packs of cigarettes and alcohol in return.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969 – Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Lichtblau</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lichtblau, the living conditions of Nazis in America were “shameful” because they were “easily” allowed to live in the U.S. while their Jewish victims “horribly” suffered in concentration camps.</p>\n<p>“The ease of allowing Nazis in America, in my view, is shameful and is a really untold period in postwar history as thousands of Nazis came to America after the war,” Lichtblau said. “It was horribly easy for them to come and horribly difficult for the liberation of Jews in America. I cringe at this sight.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that although Nazi scientists aided American scientists in developing technology to go the moon in 1969, their cooperation with the government is considered “horrible.”</p>\n<p>“Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969,” Lichtblau said, “Without them, we realistically might not have entered the moon in 1969,”</p>\n<p>Litchblau also said that there were a few “good” spies that helped the U.S. perform tasks that they could not accomplish on their own.</p>\n<p>“There were some good Nazi spies that translated documents, control zones of Europe, intercepting cables, and doing other tasks that the U.S. could not do themselves,” Litchblau said, “Some of these were anti-Soviet spies whom were rewarded.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S. I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong. – First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Litchblau, the anticommunist sentiments shared by the U.S. and Nazis in America allowed Americans to channel anticommunist Nazi sentiment into work.</p>\n<p>“Anticommunists sentiments were behind the Nazi achievements because the U.S. was against communism and this helped,” Litchblau said. “There was a notion that nobody hated the Soviets more than the Nazis and the U.S. wanted to put this hatred to work.”</p>\n<p>First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim said he was alarmed that Nazis were secretly protected by the American government and that the actions of the intelligence agencies “feels gross.”</p>\n<p>“I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S.,” Jim said. “I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Ashley Miller however said Lichtblau’s talk changed her previously held perspectives on Nazis.</p>\n<p>“Currently knowing that Nazis aided Americans with scientific and spy-related achievements, it helps me to see them as a little less worse than I previously thought of them,” Miller said. “It is mind-blowing to have my perspective change.”</p>\n<p>Psychology professor Kristen Macuga said she was “quite shocked” to learn about Operation Paperclip, since she grew up in the post Pearl Harbor-era where the U.S. was portrayed as heroic in the post-World War II historical narrative.</p>\n<p>“It is quite shocking to know this,” Macuga said. “I was born weeks after Pearl Harbor in a place that made it seem that Americans were heroes who freed Jews from concentration camps. It is shocking to know that we allowed Nazis to aid us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/","id":2929,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2928,2927,2926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee met Monday night to hear funding requests from 26 campus organizations.<br><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met to hear from 26 different organizations funding requests on Monday night.</p>\n<p>Sixteen organizations received the full funding for their requests, while seven received partial funding and three received none. Groups that were partially funded included Sigma Chi Omega, Raices De Mi Tierra, Dance Marathon, the Hong Kong Student Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, Theta Nu Kappa and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega requested funding for $5,800 and received $2,669 for their 17th annual Multicultural Show Feb 21 in Campbell Hall. According to committee member Nadia Blant, Campbell Hall is an expensive venue to fund, therefore the committee deferred on funding the entire event.</p>\n<p>“I think the venue is super expensive and because they are multicultural, there is a lot of places they could go,” Blant said, “I think we need to cut if we are going to make all these events work, so I would fund the venue but not the performing actors.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Raices De Mi Tierra received $12,000 from their requested $15,200, while Dance Marathon requested $4,350 and received $4,150 when the committee decided not to give them $200 in material costs for the event on Feb 28 at Pavilion Gym. Dance Marathon Chair Sean Thompson, who asked for funding from the committee, said Dance Marathon is “the largest collegiate charity in the nation and is present in over 250 campuses nationwide.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB. – Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We work through Children’s Miracle Network, which is a network of hospitals that are children’s hospitals and our local chapter is Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Hospital, so all of the proceeds through our Dance Marathon event go to them,” Thompson said, “My favorite part is that we bring the kids from the hospital too, so you get to meet them, dance with them and play with them.”</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong Student Association asked for $3,970 and received $1,120 for the annual Lunar New Year festival on Feb. 12 at Storke Plaza and are expecting about 200 people. According to Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam, the event’s purpose is to “emulate the festival atmosphere of a traditional Asian Lunar New Year festival by bringing UCSB our cultural foods, performances, music, games and activities.”</p>\n<p>“Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB,” Tam said.</p>\n<p>Alpha Kappa Psi received $242 from their requested $282, the $40 difference due to the committee’s inability to fund water bottles for a Coffee and Donuts event on Feb 26 in the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge.</p>\n<p>“We are hosting a professional development night open to all students. We will be hosting workshops that help fill resumes, give interview tips, stuff like that,” said a speaker for Alpha Kappa Psi.</p>\n<p>Theta Nu Kappa’s speaker third-year feminist studies and political science major Derek Wakefield received $410 for a Quidditch tournament after the committee could not fund them $75 for water bottles.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing in a sport that has never been seen, except for with the Quidditch team, but they have not had as many really wide open tournaments open at the university,” Wakefield said. “We want to make this an event that can really persist throughout the years and be something that you know people think, ‘Oh I am going to go to the Quidditch tournament like it becomes a Santa Barbara staple.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60141\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60141\" data-attachment-id=\"60141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-hears-requests/finance-board/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422350836\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Finance Board\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60141\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=440%2C293\" alt=\"A.S.

Alexander from “America’s Next Top Model” who will be giving a question and answer, meet and greet and a workshop.</p>\n<p>“Miss J. is awesome,” Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said, “I got so many texts from friends, people outside of the queer community that were just fans in general of someone who has been on television or in the fashion industry for years.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hacks was reallocated $13,654 for an event this weekend, the women’s lacrosse team received $3,000 to take 30 players to Nationals on May 4 to account for hotel and flight fees and the Wildlife Society received the requested $130 for a speaker from Washington to come give a talk on myths surrounding wolves on Feb. 23 at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration at Harder Stadium, said a speaker for the Wildlife Society.</p>\n<p>“It is where the biology department keeps all of its taxonomic collections. We have thousands and thousands of specimens, mammals, birds, so if you haven’t been there it pretty cool you should check it out,” a speaker for the Wildlife Society said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Surfriders received the requested $2,500 for Concert for the Coast on May 30 at Anisq’Oyo’ Park where proceeds will go towards the Environmental Defense Center.</p>\n<p>“We have ocean-friendly gardens and we want people to participate in that and are trying to change their grass lawns into really efficient ways to collect ocean runoff and to prevent pollution from the streets from going into the ocean,” a speaker for Surfriders said, “We also have a ‘Rise above Plastics’ campaign and we want to gain awareness about that.”</p>\n<p>Reel Loud was not given funding for their $12,000 request for the 23rd Annual Film Festival that will take place May 22, as it was unclear where the money they would make off of the event would go. Committee member Ava Rezai said the committee will table the event.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos and Sigma Alpha Zeta received funding for $19,812 towards outreach to high school students and UCSB’s League of Legends is hosting an e-sports charity tournament and received $500 for food for the event on Feb. 8 from in the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>Religion Experience in Mind received $620, the

transmitted infections worldwide in order to promote local advocacy and action.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and residential assistant Saxon Cropper is hosting the event with help from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbosl\">the Office of Student Life</a> Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, UCSB After Dark, Housing and Community Living, Pacific Pride, Queer Student Union (QSU) and Black Student Union (BSU). Yesterday featured a discussion with Pacific Pride about advancements in HIV/AIDS, and today will include a student dialogue with QSU related to HIV/AIDS and sex traffic workers. Wednesday involves a campus-wide action to wear all black, and on Friday free and discrete HIV/AIDS testing will be provided in De Anza Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and BSU member Ricky Barajas said the overall goal of this week is to support QSU and address HIV/AIDS as a significant issue affecting both the LGBTQ+ community and the black community.</p>\n<p>“I think that it is very important to recognize the intersections between race and sexuality, because black people account for 12 percent of the population, but over 40 percent of infected people are black,” Barajas said. “BSU supports this event because of how our community is disproportionately affected, and also because we want to stand in solidarity with other organizations and people who are striving to educate and advocate for people affected by this issue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference. – Event host Saxon Cropper</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cropper said the weeklong event is meant to send a reminder that HIV/AIDS is an issue that impacts everyone within an afflicted community, both directly and indirectly.</p>\n<p>“My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference,” Cropper said. “We can learn to be more sensitive and finally learn to protect ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Cropper, because there is social stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and a general lack of education on about it on campus, organizations hosting the event aim to eliminate the stigma and offer accurate information about it on campus.</p>\n<p>“By social stigma, I mean that within spaces, people have made HIV a social taboo,” Cropper said. “People should know that HIV is not a death sentence and that there are people living with HIV who are living healthy lives.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS. – First-year economics major Derrick Duren</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies major and QSU co-chair Roger Gonzalez said the event provides an opportunity for the university to support victims of HIV/AIDS in addition to participating in the annual AIDS walk.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara has an annual AIDS walk, but UCSB doesn’t have anything to do with it so it’s important especially for college students because it’s important for us to be aware of it on our campus and help out those who do have HIV or AIDS,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics major Derrick Duren, the campus benefits from events like the HIV/AIDS Awareness Week because it supports community members who struggle with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<p>“This AIDS Awareness Week will be an amazing way to enlighten our student body to the reality of living with STIs,” Duren said. “Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
