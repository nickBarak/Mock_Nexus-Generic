According to SCNCC, climate change is especially a threat to the poor, women, people of color and those who live in the Global South. After an initial introduction on Friday night, the conference held various workshops, plenary sessions and activities to encourage sharing ideas that challenge the current system. Over 20 workshops were held throughout the weekend, each offering a slightly different perspective on the various issues of poverty, environment and human rights.<br>\nOrganizer and UCSB professor of sociology John Foran said a graduate student in his sociology class, Earth in Crisis, inspired him to join SCNCC. According to Foran, climate change is a result of capitalism and requires a better, more extensive solution.</p>\n<p>“I learned about [SCNCC] and I thought this was more or less what I think about the climate crisis — that it needs a deep systemic solution, a radical solution,” Foran said. “The climate crisis cannot be solved within the logic of capitalism or globalization as we know it — it’s too big and caused by the normal operation of those systems.”</p>\n<p>Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein addressed the audience through Skype, and said there needs to be a “comprehensive solution for a comprehensive problem” that solves issues of climate change as well as social inequality.</p>\n<p>“We need solutions that address jobs that address climate, that address racial justice,” Stein said. “Ecology is pitted against our economy and our jobs and this is a false divide, so it’s very important we put out solutions that meet it and that we take on the economic crisis at the same time as the environment.”<br>\nAccording to Stein, there should be increased financial aid for students who struggle to pay for higher education.</p>\n<p>“About two-thirds of all college students, both current and former, are in disabling debt because their jobs do not provide enough to pay back that debt,” Stein said. “We are not only calling for free public higher education but also to abolish student debt. It is critical to bail out of students to liberate our younger generation to be the leaders that they must be.”</p>\n<p>Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant delivered a short speech through a YouTube video and said the current capitalistic economy and political systems prioritize profits and neglect people and the environment.</p>\n<p>“This is the reality of international capitalism,” Sawant said. “This is the product of the gigantic casino of speculation created by those highway robbers on Wall Street and the rapacious oil vultures. In this system, the market is God and everything is sacrificed on the altar of profit.”</p>\n<p>Foran said the title of the conference combines the need for social equality and to preserve the environment to form the term “ecosocialism.”</p>\n<p>“Socialism, translated into what it means in my heart, means trying to create a more equal society,” Foran said. “It means fighting against the gross inequality that exists in the world today. Ecosocialism brings in the climate crisis part … By 21st-century ecosocialism, we mean a new kind of ecosocialism that is explicitly and deeply democratic. It’s a way of saying we don’t think there’s enough democracy in the world today.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, the conference cultivates interest in those who are just discovering the movement and connects them with long-time activists.</p>\n<p>“This conference brings together our undergrads, who are starting to have a little interest in the climate crisis, with people who are up and down the coast of all generations, who are seasoned ecosocialists,” Foran said. “Out of these chance encounters grow relationships and new knowledge and new passion.”</p><div

Packing on October 12 on the Student Resource Building (SRB) lawn from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active Minds, a nationwide nonprofit organization aiming to change the stigma surrounding mental illness and encourage students to seek help, debuted the event at the National Mall in Washington D.C. in 2008. Since then, more than 320,000 people in 98 cities throughout the country have attended Send Silence Packing. The event displays 1,100 backpacks to represent the 1,100 college students who lose their lives to suicide each year. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for college students.</p>\n<p>Active Minds staff advisor and Associate Director of Student Mental Health Coordination Services Ryan Sims said the host organizations have worked hard to make the event possible.</p>\n<p>“The event really has been three years in the making,” Sims said. “Active Minds has partnered with Mental Wellness Center to fundraise over $5,000 to put the event on, which is something we are very proud of.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mental Wellness Center CEO Annmarie Cameron said universities have to “compete” to host a Send Silence Packing event.</p>\n<p>“The process of getting Send Silence Packing to come to UCSB has taken three years,” Cameron said. “To qualify, the university itself has to provide adequate emotional support for the students that are impacted by the exhibit and UCSB’s mental health services are exceptional for this type of event.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said she hopes seeing backpacks at the event will “make it real” for students that suicide can affect their peers.</p>\n<p>“I hope the message that people will take away is that we are all affected by suicide,” Stanford said. “Talking to your friend if you see that they’re struggling and knowing how to help someone struggling is so important for college students.”</p>\n<p>Sims said he believes the “powerful display” will prompt those passing by to consider what the backpacks represent.</p>\n<p>“Many of the backpacks were created by friends, family members and partners of those that have passed away and include the student’s personal stories, pictures and treasured personal belongings,” Sims said. “I’m most looking forward to UCSB students pausing for a moment, taking this all in and thinking about who might be writing their story if they’re considering suicide as a way of ending their pain.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lauren Peterson said she will attend the event because she struggled with depression and anxiety her first year at UCSB, but hesitated to seek out metal health services in fear of others thinking less of her.</p>\n<p>“Mental health stigmas prevented me from seeking help or even talking to anyone about my depression and anxiety,” Peterson said. “Once I was able to talk to others, their acceptance and drive to learn more about mental health was so relieving and helped me greatly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the sensitive nature of this event, Sims said C.A.P.S. will provide psychologists for the event.</p>\n<p>“Everyone will be impacted uniquely, and having these psychologists on the day of is a cornerstone of being selected as a school to host,” Sims said.</p>\n<p>Stanford said Send Silence Packing will serve as a “kickoff event” for UC Student Association’s upcoming mental health campaign, #HowAreYou.</p>\n<p>“Most people that are considering suicide do want to talk about it. Something as simple as ‘how are you’ can really help someone that is struggling with a mental illness,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Active Minds will host their first informational meeting on Tuesday in the SRB multipurpose room at 6 p.m. for students interested in the organization.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Ortega served two tours in Iraq, one tour in Afghanistan and is currently a helicopter crew chief stationed in Oahu, Hawaii. Ortega stepped into the national spotlight over the last year, advocating for transgender rights in the military.</p>\n<p>Ortega said the takeaway from the event should be to engage in more honest and difficult discussions about rights for marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>“Have tough conversations with people,” Ortega said. “That’s the most powerful thing you can do. They don’t have to be conversations where you attack or are in opposition, but you have to have tough, honest conversations with people.”</p>\n<p>Ortega said people have the responsibility to be involved in decision-making as conscientious voters.</p>\n<p>“We have to start the change with us,” Ortega said. “If you want there to be change … you need to get out there and vote.”</p>\n<p>According to Ortega, the Pentagon currently has a 12-person council led by Under Secretary of the Army Brad R. Carson to discuss transgender rights in the military. Ortega said the council’s decisions often correlate with the public’s opinion.</p>\n<p>“The decision about trans inclusion in the military is currently with a think tank led by Mr. Carson, the Under Secretary of the Department of the Army and 12 guys at the Pentagon with whom I correspond,” Ortega said.</p>\n<p>RCSGD director David Whitman said Ortega addressed important issues on which many students lack knowledge, such as the varying identities on a “gender spectrum.”</p>\n<p>“As a trans man and a trans masculine-presenting person, Ortega gave a lot of awareness to different identities within the gender spectrum,” Whitman said. “He talked about his journey as a trans person and what aspects of his life led to his ability to be himself and I think that was empowering.”</p>\n<p>Whitman said Ortega’s talk is also applicable to university students, though the talk focused on his experience in the military.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see UCSB students come together and prioritize diversity initiatives,” Whitman said. “There are endless communities and intersections in those communities that are very much at risk but are also very much deserving of our respect, love, attention … the more we lean into things we don’t know about … I think the healthier our communities will be.”</p>\n<p>Diversity Education Coordinator for RCSGD and third-year sociology major Khadeja Tran said the campus should increase the number of resources for transgender students.</p>\n<p>“There are also trans people on campus, a lot of them, who maybe aren’t out yet, who maybe are in between, who need the resources or help from faculty, staff and students to feel more included and for the campus environment to be more inclusive,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Second-year music composition major Tino Jones said Ortega carried the conversation about transgender rights in the military into public focus.</p>\n<p>“Transgender appearance in the military is something that has been widely debated — whether or not [they] should be there,” Jones said. “Shane Ortega’s success is showing that you can do things even though someone may tell you that you can’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Planned Parenthood Generation Action lobbied in favor of Assembly Bill 329 (AB 329), authored by Assemblymember Shirley Weber, which passed into law on Oct. 1 and aims to strengthen sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention. On Sept. 29, members tabled for Pink Out Day of Action, a nation-wide movement to spread information about the services Planned Parenthood provides such as cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing and birth control.</p>\n<p>Director of public affairs at Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Gina Fischer said the UCSB chapter brought six students to Sacramento to lobby in support of AB 329 in June 2015.</p>\n<p>“We had our students taking a lead talking to our legislators about the importance of this bill,” Fischer said. “We teach them how to organize their communities and how to talk to elected officials and how to develop their own leadership skills in the reproductive justice movement.”</p>\n<p>Co-president of Planned Parenthood Generation Action at UCSB and second-year feminist studies major Jill Pember said she attended the Planned Parenthood Generation Action Conference in Washington D.C. and spoke to politicians.</p>\n<p>“I got the chance to lobby to representatives of our California senators and to California congresswomen and that was really inspiring,” Pember said. “It was amazing to share my story with politicians and really feel like I was making a difference.”</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology major Anastacia Menemenlis said she is “grateful” for the services Planned Parenthood Generation Action at UCSB provides.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate their effort and any effort to increase student awareness about birth control and sexual health issues,” Menemenlis said.</p>\n<p>Students for Life UCSB president and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said Students for Life tables on campus and encourages students to consider alternatives to abortion, providing them with resources to make their decision.</p>\n<p>“We table on campus to raise awareness about abortion and let students know that there are alternatives to abortion,” Devlin said. “We have a list of resources to give to pregnant students to help them, and we work to provide a safe and supportive community.”</p>\n<p>Second-year anthropology and psychology double-major Lauren Van Oeveren said it is positive for both organizations to educate the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s cool that people are sharing their knowledge or beliefs so that people can form an opinion,” Van Oeveren said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65125\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65125\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/","id":2683,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[2682,2681,2680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate, reforming Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) funding and to vote on the five bills presented at last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.K. bill, approved in January 2013, sets aside $10,000 to be used by science and engineering student organizations on large-scale projects, in addition to their own fundraising efforts. Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman, Residence Hall Association (RHA) President Matilda Mead and second-year political science major On-campus Senator Jose Magaña presented to senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>At last week’s senate meeting, On-campus Senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.”</p>\n<p>Lieberman said implementing single transferable voting, in which voters would rank each candidate, would require adapting the online voting system. According to Lieberman, UC Berkeley currently utilizes a single transferable voting system and produces election results in three to seven days, while UCSB tabulates votes within three hours.</p>\n<p>“I would call [single transferable voting] low voter patience. We’ve never asked people to rank 30 candidates in past elections,” Lieberman said. “In order to explain what effect the complex nature of single transferable voting will have on counting the votes, I read Berkeley’s elections code regarding tallying. They give three to seven days — three is the minimum — to seven days and we usually get it [the results] out in three hours.”</p>\n<p>Mead said she is working to establish RHA liaisons in A.S Senate and Committee meetings, and productivity could increase if A.S. and RHA worked together.</p>\n<p>“I’ve decided to shift the RHA’s focus to putting a greater focus on advocacy and initiative,” Mead said. “Our residents are affected the same way your students are affected.”</p>\n<p>Mead also said there may be concerns of potentially conflicting interests between students and Housing &amp; Residential Services (HRS) if RHA were to work with A.S Senate and Committees, but the benefits outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p>“I completely agree that some committees are not suitable for RHA members to sit on,” Mead said. “Luckily, there are many other committees that are, and all of these committees that potentially benefit from having a member the residence halls report to and from [RHA] organization.”</p>\n<p>Magaña said he hopes to increase the impact RHA has on A.S and expand the responsibilities of floor representatives, which he believes will improve student body representation.</p>\n<p>“I will send bills and resolutions that they can look over because I believe in direct representation from my constituents,” Magaña said. “We represent RHA here, but RHA has its own committee so they have a direct representation of people in the residence hall.”</p>\n<p>According to Magaña, floor representatives are willing to increase their responsibilities once they are more involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I’ve talked to past floor reps about retention,” Magaña said. “Some of their concerns is not necessarily about hour commitment but because they feel like they didn’t have much say even though their position is immensely important.”</p>\n<p>Magaña then presented “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senate Position.”</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and third-year biochemistry and chemistry major Dustin Larrazolo presented bills on forming an A.S. Student Councils and establishing funds.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo presented “A Bill to Establish A.S. Student Councils” which outlines a plan to provide a legislative outlet for CCS and College of Engineering (CoE) students to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“The CCS student council held their first forum and got 40 attendees,” Larrazolo said. “[CCS and CoE] will be able to get a lot more resources that they do not have and also be more connected with A.S.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo then presented “A Bill to Redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds” and “A Bill to Establish the Creative, Artistic, Research, and Diversity Fund,” which outlines two A.S funds to support students’ academic projects and research.</p>\n<p>Senate moved seven new bills and five old bills from last week to the Campus Affairs committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The demonstration was successful in gaining cooperation from UCSB administrators. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five months after students gathered for a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office to present 13 demands regarding campus sexual assault policy, administrators are continuing to collaborate with students on various improvements to support survivors and punish perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The May sit-in led by student group #NowUCSB, formerly “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You,” resulted in Yang agreeing to consider a list of 13 demands, including stricter punishments for offenders, improved sensitivity training for faculty and staff and greater diversity among on-campus aid groups and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). The farthest-reaching policy change from the demands is a UC-wide requirement in June for all faculty and staff to undergo sexual violence and consent training. Other changes include increased sexual assault training for IVFP deputies and advertising for the Sexual Assault Survivor Fund on campus, which provides financial support to survivors to cover immediate expenses.</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB leader and third-year Chican@ studies major Alejandra Melgoza said while an estimated 95 percent of the demands are in progress, the bureaucracy involved with certain demands has caused delayed implementation.</p>\n<p>“So many survivors for so many years have been waiting for these changes to happen, and, right now, we have policy demands that we have to make happen,” Melgoza said. “Because of all the red tape we have to go through, it will take a long time.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said while the support of students and staff pressured the administration to make changes, ongoing education is still necessary to the movement’s success.</p>\n<p>“I have been very grateful for the support from Associated Students, faculty, staff, grad students and workers across the campus,” Melgoza said. “It has made an impact, and people are aware of it, but it’s very important to highlight to the new incoming class. They need to know what happened last year so that they can support it.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said with the start of the new academic year, more students will become involved in the campaign.</p>\n<p>“There has been progress on many of the thirteen demands, though we have been waiting for students to return to get their feedback and involvement in several of the demand areas,” Fleming said in an email. “I am hoping to see a diverse group of students established with whom staff and administrators can meet on a regular, perhaps monthly, basis to discuss issues of sexual and interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB’s first three demands, which request students found guilty of sexual assault be immediately suspended for a minimum of four quarters and removed from campus, have to be approved by UC Office of the President. According to Fleming, the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault will soon release updated UC-wide policies.</p>\n<p>“There is a system-wide committee that is part of President Napolitano’s Taskforce on Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault that is about to issue new UC adjudication and sanctioning guidelines, so the Office of Judicial Affairs is waiting for these guidelines to inform any changes related to adjudication of sexual assault cases and disciplinary sanctions,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>UConsent coordinator, Take Back the Night co-chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan said the University is “dragging their feet” in addressing students’ demands for improved sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the university has delayed putting the demands into effect, given their history of handling cases of sexual assault and their initial resistance to these ideas,” Morgan said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morgan said she is hopeful the demands will soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>“I think [administrators] are beginning to realize that by helping this forward, they are paving the way for the UCs in terms of sexual assault reform,” Morgan said in an email. “I’m hoping that this notion, along with constant pressure from those involved, will get these demands implemented within this school year.”<br>\nAccording to Melgoza, there is still a long way to go before survivors of sexual assault receive sufficient support from the University.</p>\n<p>“These are the lives of students; their power was taken away,” Melgoza said. “It’s important to acknowledge that fact and make sure those survivors are given that power again.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Speakers shared their experiences coming out during the initial portion of the event, followed by an open mic for attendees to share their own stories.</p>\n<p>Third-year history major William Roberts said the event communicated the “diversity of experiences” people have when coming out.</p>\n<p>“Revealing [coming out] as not to be the one-time event … but as a complex, sometimes difficult, but ultimately beautiful and liberating experience felt differently by all queer and trans people,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Jean Mack, whose name has been changed, said she has a “split lifestyle” because she has not come out as bisexual in her hometown in Northern California but is involved with many LGBTQ events at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s very freeing to be in a community where you can be your whole self,” Mack said. “I think for many people, especially coming in as freshmen, it’s their first experience where they can be around queer people.”</p>\n<p>Mack said she was comfortable speaking at the “Coming Out Monologues” because organizers reached out to a wide range of identities when advertising the event.</p>\n<p>“I think a very subtle thing … which I hope they continue doing, is putting all sorts of identities on the poster itself for the event,” Mack said. “[It] was a big deal for me because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel like I’m not straight enough for straight places and I’m not queer enough for gay spaces so it’s this weird in-between.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Shelley Alvarez, whose name and year have been changed, said being queer at UCSB is “a lot less alienating” than she expected, but finding spaces for everyday interactions is still difficult.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the settings in which people congregate to are very sexual in nature, or they involve a lot of drinking and hook-ups and sometimes you just want to find a group of people to hang out with and have fun with,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>According to RCGSD Graduate Assistant and Ph.D. candidate Alex Kulick, LGBTQ communities and resources on campus and in I.V. need to be made more apparent to students.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the big issues that I’ve noticed really is a lack of visibility,” Kulick said. “There’s certainly a lot of spaces, especially in Isla Vista, that are not necessarily visibly queer or don’t have any visible presence of queer-friendly spaces.”</p>\n<p>Kulick said it was his first time attending the “Coming Out Monologues.”</p>\n<p>“I was just really, really impressed by the courage of the students and the vulnerability that they were able to share, and also, I think the diversity of the experiences that were showcased along different lines of gender, race, ethnicity, class and, of course, all types of different other experiences that people come from.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The committee fully granted six requests, partially granted six requests and tabled two requests.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi requested $656 for a campus event and $2,300 to send five members to the Leadership and Excellence Academies for Deltasigs in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member Austin Kang said the group’s first request was for an Oct. 23 event to educate UCSB students about the nonprofit organization Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Koreans escape to other countries.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful that [this event] will bring awareness about the condition and the situations that people in North Korea live in,” Kang said. “There is going to be at least one refugee that will speak.”</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group $656 but tabled its request for $2,300 to the Oct. 12 meeting.</p>\n<p>KCSB representative Matt Merritt requested $2,000 for Hello World!, a music festival on Oct. 10 in Anisq’Oyo’ Park that will feature Scientist, The Lions and Cornerstone.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing these groups, musical groups, from all around the world to come and perform,” Merritt said. “We are educating the community on these groups and their cultures. And then also educational in the sense that we are bringing members of our own community in one place to appreciate and discover each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund KCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB League of Legends (L.o.L.) treasurer Elaine Hu and public relations chair Albert Chen requested $80 for a gaming event Oct. 11at the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund UCSB L.o.L.</p>\n<p>Swing and Ballroom Dance Club co-treasurer Cecilia Gutierrez and president Steve Carlan requested $2,594 for a free swing dance event Oct. 24 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $1,460 for a band, refreshments and Community Service Officers (CSO’s) at the event.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club treasurer Alex Vera and vice president Samuel Anspach requested $2,921 for the club’s annual dance competition, Beach Ball.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $2,120 to hire professional dancers for the event.</p>\n<p>Transfer Student Alliance requested for $426 for their first general meeting on Oct. 14 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the group for its upcoming event.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major José Magaña requested $2,474 from senate unallocated funds for condom dispensers to place in bathrooms around campus.</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said the committee should fund Magaña’s project, because it fully granted KCSB’s request.</p>\n<p>“Safe sex is more important than a broadcasting radio station’s event,” Larrazolo said.</p>\n<p>Kevin Koo recommended Magaña request funds through a campus organization in order to access OSL funds as opposed to senate unallocated.</p>\n<p>“He is working with other student groups and OSL groups,” Koo said. “He could just come in next week.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to table Magaña’s request until its Oct. 12 meeting, suggesting he seek other funding options throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B then voted to fund Lindy Circle $2,000 out of its first request of $2,743, as well as $520 of its second request of $580.</p>\n<p>Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) member Charles Jones requested $7,995 for its annual, three-day Greeks 4 Kids fundraising event, which includes a carnival, dodgeball tournament and dance-off.</p>\n<p>The committee funded ATO $6,595, including $3,200 to rent Campbell Hall for the dance-off.</p>\n<p>Professor of sociology John Foran requested $1,006 on behalf of System Change Not Climate Change for the group’s upcoming conference, 21st Century Ecosocialism: Practicing System Change, Making Connections, Building a Movement, which will take place Oct. 9 through Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Foran said the conference is an opportunity to educate students who are not taking classes about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Certainly this is something that should be of great interest to our students in a number of other classes on campus,” Foran said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund System Change Not Climate Change.</p>\n<p>The committee then voted to grant UCSB Students for Bernie Sanders the $175 it requested for a Democratic presidential debate viewing event Oct. 13 in the Hub and to grant BSU the $590 it requested.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article did not include the entirety of Larrazolo’s quote and misnamed his majors. A previous version of this article also said Delta Sigma Pi requested funding to attend Leadership Empowerment Alliance Development, but the event is called Leadership and Excellence Academics for Deltasigs.]</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

three-floor residence for visiting scholar physicists located adjacent to the San Clemente Villages, scheduled to open late next year.</p>\n<p>American businessman and philanthropist Charlie Munger donated $65 million to be used for constructing the Visiting Scholars Residence, a 75,000-square-foot building located on El Colegio Road west of San Clemente apartments. The Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP includes meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms. The residence will also house a flag hall to display national flags of current visiting scholars. Construction began October 2014 and the Visiting Scholars Residence is planned to open late 2016. KITP is a research facility created in 1979 which hosts programs such as Deconstructing the Sense of Smell and Dynamics and Evolution of Earth-like Planets.</p>\n<p>KITP residence manager James Brill said he currently collaborates with visiting scholars to coordinate housing in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara. According to Brill, he contributed to the layout design of the Visiting Scholars Residence and attributes the success of the construction to Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“We had a very informal rental program … so as a result, years ago, they really thought about making some sort of residence,” Brill said. “Then, as we kept adding more and more scientists, it became a definite need, and then just last year Charlie Munger decided to give us a very, very generous grant to build the residence.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the residence will accommodate visiting scholars at UCSB as well as their families.</p>\n<p>“We’ve designed a lot of the rooms to be family friendly — we have like a child’s play room and we want to make sure nothing is stopping you from coming and being as productive as you can possibly be while you’re here,” Brill said.</p>\n<p>According to Brill, the meeting rooms allow visiting physicists to interact off-campus and to conduct their work in their living setting.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got everyone working on a program, you’re all together, which is something the physicists really wanted,” Brill said. “It’s really nice that you can do a lot of intensive work no matter where you are.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the exterior of the Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP is meant to resemble Santa Barbara architecture.</p>\n<p>“Because we have such a big international group, we tried to tie it into the construction that we have in Santa Barbara … we want it to fit into the aesthetic of the neighborhood,” Brill said. “The main goal of KITP is to get people from all parts of the world to get together.”</p>\n<p>Director of KITP and professor of astrophysics and cosmology Lars Bildsten said KITP hosts programs year round to “capture frontier topics” and provide a venue for open discussions.</p>\n<p>“The major thing that the KITP provides for the university is a huge flock of physicists that come for long periods and interact mostly with each other, but most of our activities are open to the campus,” Bildsten said. “So we get a lot of physics graduates students, mathematical graduate students, biology students who come and interact with the visitors.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of biophysics and KITP permanent member Boris Shraiman said KITP is a “fantastic” place physicists can visit to be inspired.</p>\n<p>“[The] new residence will allow our physicists to stay together and keep working and thinking about science 24/7,” Shraiman said. “It will become immediately an attraction and I expect to go there in the evening to hang out with the scientists.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

2015-2016 school year to facilitate conversations with anyone interested.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto began regularly talking with students, faculty and campus visitors last fall, standing at the booth from either 9 a.m. or noon until 3 p.m. He aims to connect with the younger generation through conversation and is willing to chat with anyone about any topic or question.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although the advice and conversations are free, he accepts donations to support mission trips.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about the money so I always have a sign that it’s free,” Calvaletto said. “My children were missionaries in Africa, they’ve now returned to the States, but I plan to use it to help some other types of missions somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said his main goal is to “make a difference” and encourage the younger generation to make smart decisions.</p>\n<p>“I see culture changing faster than I ever imagined,” Calvaletto said. “So my goal is to one by one encourage students to do what they feel is right.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, the most important advice he has to offer was given to him by an upperclassman when he attended California Maritime Academy.</p>\n<p>“After a week I wanted to quit,” Calvaletto said. “And an upperclassmen came alongside me and said, ‘You can quit if you want, but you’re not getting back any of your money.’ What I suggest is just stay for this semester and if at the end of this semester if you decide to quit you can quit then.”</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Dean of Student Life &amp; Activities Katya Armistead said she approved his booth to be on campus and has received nothing but positive comments about Calvaletto.<br>\n“He’s a colorful fellow; I see students really enjoy talking with him,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, his questions and conversations usually revolve around relationships.</p>\n<p>“What does that tell you about mankind? We were designed for relationships,” Calvaletto said. “People are hurting because of broken relationships — I can only tell them it takes time to heal some of these things.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although he identifies as a conservative Catholic, he is not here to argue his beliefs, despite rumours on social media sites like Reddit.</p>\n<p>“I’m open and honest talking about a relationship with God,” Calvaletto said. “I’m not here to argue; I’m here to be a light and I do believe God loves all these students but it’s not about a religion, it’s about a relationship.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she was fine with him conversing with students so long as he does not provide academic counseling.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern wasn’t in terms of what his opinion was; it was that he wasn’t trying to provide anything that was university business,” Armistead said.<br>\nThird-year economics major Christopher Wong said Calvaletto has a lot to offer students on campus.</p>\n<p>“He’s cool, just doing his thing, posting at the corner with his 5 cents sign, probably the most productive 5 cents you can give somebody,” Wong said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/","id":2710,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[2709,2708,2707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Library Opening Postponed","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Library_Photos-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Library_Photos-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Library Senior Writer Karen Lindell said the expanded library will open on Jan. 4, 2016, rather than this November as was announced this summer.

It’s nice to have a new apartment and not have to share a shower with more than one person,” Tang said in an email. “I lived in Santa Ynez before and it definitely a lot nicer [here], especially the new appliances, also there’s a lot less ants.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Allie Lobos said she chose to live at Sierra Madre and though the new apartments are clean, she dislikes the 1.8 mile commute to campus.</p>\n<p>“Living here is great. It’s new, it’s clean, but I wish I did live in Isla Vista,” Lobos said. “My biggest complaint is the distance; I have three 8 a.m.s a week.”</p>\n<p>Tang said despite the distance, he would be willing to choose to live in Sierra Madre Village Apartments again.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of far and taking the bus can be annoying when I miss it and become late for class, but I like it a lot and would choose to live here again,” Tang said again, in an email.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major and transfer student Vanessa Guevara said she likes living farther from campus and closer to the supermarkets, and she is looking forward to the completion of the convenience store and recreational building.</p>\n<p>“I like how far it is; it feels more secluded from the main campus and it’s close to groceries,” Guevara said in an email. “I hope the store and gym opens soon though. I bike so it’s not really a problem and the living space is nice especially since it was just built.”</p>\n<p>Project Executive Joe Linden said the administration and recreation building will be completed in two to three weeks’ time, and until then students will be surrounded in a loud environment. Linden also said the faculty building which burned down July 4, 2014 is nearing completion.</p>\n<p>“Everything is on schedule but some community buildings still have about two weeks left,” Linden said. “Building seven which is located by Whittier and Storke Road has two to three weeks left as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of

IVCRC plans to hold many food-related activities to fulfil its goal of focusing on food security and food justice this year.</p>\n<p>IVCRC advisor Ruth Guevara Garcia said the carnival is meant to strengthen the I.V. community in the recently restored central area.</p>\n<p>“Pardall Carnival was established in 2009 as a way to highlight the renovation of Pardall Road and bring students and kids living in Isla Vista together,” Garcia said.<br>\nIVCRC external chair Aimee Hanna said A.S. Food Bank and COSWB will provide services at the event.</p>\n<p>“A.S Food Bank’s table that will be hosting a food distribution, as well as UCSB’s COSWB will be there providing free yoga to carnival-goers,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>Hanna said IVCRC will reward game participants at the carnival with “Pardollas,” which they redeem at I.V. restaurants on the day of the event.</p>\n<p>“If people participate in any of the free games we have going on, they will receive Pardollas in which they can use in restaurants that are participating to score deals on free food,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim, the carnival will feature free activities music from KCSB-FM.</p>\n<p>“We really want to emphasize that there will be tons of free giveaways and games to participate in,” Lim said. “I’m really excited about KCSB attending and providing cool DJ sets for people to listen to while they’re there as well.”</p>\n<p>Lim said IVCRC expects a large turnout at the carnival.</p>\n<p>“We have over 1,000 people that have RSVPed on the Facebook event, but we are anticipating way more than that to attend on the day of,” Lim said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/","id":2704,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2703,2702,2701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented five bills written by himself and off-campus senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik regarding future A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said the department is currently discussing events as alternatives to the I.V. party scene during Halloween and the option of assigning fewer law enforcement officers to the community than were present last year.</p>\n<p>“As we’ve done in the past year, there has been a good reduction of people during Halloween,” Signa said. “The general plan is focusing hard on putting together concerts on campus that draw students on campus to sober events. The goal is to start reducing the number of officers. We want to have Halloween known not as an outsider event but a local event for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.” Nemeh said a single transferable vote system, which aims to establish proportional representation by allowing voters to rank candidates, could improve voter representation in A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“This process ensures that votes are not wasted,” Nemeh said. “We want to have a multi-party system.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented and “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 2 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines a new process by which new political parties register through the Office of Student Life (OSL).</p>\n<p>Nemeh said parties should register as campus political organizations through OSL because they are active year round.</p>\n<p>“The Elections Code assumes parties aren’t active outside of week four of winter through week six of spring quarters, which is certainly not true,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh also said political parties registered as campus organizations through OSL would receive an advisor to help them “organize politically” throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“Students who feel unsafe or stressed out or lost will have an advisor as a resource for this party,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 4 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines A.S. campaign regulations such as procedures for candidate forums.</p>\n<p>Senate tabled the five bills until its following meeting on Oct. 7.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/","id":2694,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2693,2692,2691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B) met for their first meeting of Fall Quarter on Monday in the UCen State Street Room.</p>\n<p>The Committee heard from six student organizations including Students for Life of America, Laughology, Mab Productions, UCSB Model United Nations (MUN), Sketch ‘N’ Sniff and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC). A.S. F&amp;B fully funded Students for Life of America and partially funded the other five student groups.</p>\n<p>IFC Vice President of Communications Austin Hechler requested $15,000 to bring RL Grime to the Thunderdome on Nov. 10 for a benefit concert to raise funds to improve Greek Park.</p>\n<p>“If you have seen the park recently it is really run down with basketball courts that have cracks all over it, volleyball courts with weeds going everywhere,” Hechler said. “All fraternities and sororities will be represented in this park and this park is not just exclusively for Greeks; anyone who wants to host an event there can host an event there. We just want to make sure that it looks aesthetically good.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted IFC $10,000 for stage and lighting expenses and tabled the remaining $5,000, asking Hechler to return the following week to answer further questions.</p>\n<p>A representative of Students for Life of America said the group will use the $500 allocated for venue and security fees for a debate on abortion they plan to host on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We are hopefully going to have a philosophical debate about abortion,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Board member Nawar Nemeh said he is concerned only one side of the debate is advertising for the event.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it will be a problem, but we should keep in mind that the advertising is being done by one side of the issue and it is a philosophical debate on a controversial issue,” Nemeh said. “I don’t know if we can fund, like, an independent entity and can advertise for them.”</p>\n<p>But A.S. F&amp;B Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez said, the Committee should not consider the content of the group’s event when deciding whether or not to fund it.</p>\n<p>“Any decision you make on funding for any event has to be content-neutral so we don’t make decisions on what the content is of any speaker that comes here,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Laughology President Matthew Ducket requested funding for this year’s performances including regular Saturday night shows, a possible live broadcast from Jake and Amir from College Humor and a show with comedian Moshe Kasher who appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon”<em>, </em>“Conan” and “@midnight.”</p>\n<p>“We put on a free show every Saturday at 8 at Embarcadero Hall,” Ducket said. “We do that every Saturday with the exception of during Thanksgiving, dead week and finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Ducket, A.S. has funded Laughology in previous years.</p>\n<p>“A.S. has kind of been the backbone for us, at least for the past four years that I have been part of this club,” Ducket said. “We typically get the majority of our funding from you guys and it really helps us to put on not just our shows in general but put on great shows.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Laughology $1,120 of the requested $1,570.</p>\n<p>A Mab Productions representative requested $2,500 for its 25th Annual Monologue Festival, which will take place the first or second weekend of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The Monologue Festival comprises a series of monologues that are written by UCSB students, performed by UCSB students and are acted by UCSB students from majors all across campus,” the representative said. “I personally directed a monologue that was written by a thermodynamics student and acted by one of the Bachelor of Fine Arts students from the Department of Theater and Dance, being an English major myself.”</p>\n<p>The representative said Mab wants to expand its reach beyond campus and the requested money would fund advertising throughout Santa Barbara in publications such as the <em>Independent</em>.</p>\n<p>“We are asking for slightly more funding for advertising to explore some things like putting an ad in the newspaper or possibly on the radio,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Kevin Koo said he did not want the Committee to fund high advertising costs that do not target UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of work in advertising and I just think this number is not very feasible,” Koo said. “I would like to see that cost lower.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Mab $1,500 of the requested $2,500 and advised the group to advertise in the <em>Daily Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line. </em></p>\n<p>“I understand how you want to build a big audience group, but I kind of want to put students first in this opinion,” Koo said.</p>\n<p>UCSB MUN Under-Secretary-General of External Affairs Akshaya Natarajan requested $4,465 to take 12 delegates to the TrojanMUN Conference Oct. 29 through Nov. 1 at the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>“We are an academic travel team and competitive team that goes to conferences and hosts our own conferences here on campus that simulates the United Nations,” Natarajan said. “We do a lot of this primarily around debate, research, public speaking, things like that.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted UCSB MUN $2,836 of the requested $4,469.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B also allocated the improvisation group Sketch ‘N’ Sniff $1,300 of the requested $1,900 for ads and facility fees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/","id":2703,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2702,2701,2700],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":62,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
