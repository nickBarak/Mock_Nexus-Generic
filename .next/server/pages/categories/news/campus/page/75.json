Adds Museum Studies Emphasis","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.</p>\n<p>The emphasis combines specialized courses with selective internships at the Art, Design &amp; Architecture (ADA) Museum to give students a more broad education on museum-related careers. The emphasis has three main components: lower and upper division courses and seminars specific to the Museum Studies emphasis, internship opportunities, which are provided by the ADA Museum and two courses taken outside of the department to provide an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of Museum Studies.</p>\n<p>Director of the Museum Studies emphasis and a lecturer in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, Carole Paul said the emphasis will focus on the multiple facets of museum studies, which include emphasizes on historical, theoretical, operational and ideological aspects of art and architecture. </p>\n<p>“Many students in Art History are asking, ‘What am I going to do with a degree in Art History?’ and this is kind of a practical answer,” Paul said. “Through the internships and by giving students a broader knowledge about museums, they can begin thinking about a career path.”</p>\n<p>Paul said while most museum studies programs in the country are graduate programs with narrow foci, the new emphasis has an advantage in that it allows students to begin museum work as undergraduates.</p>\n<p>“With museum work, the sooner you’re introduced to it, the better. I myself had internships as an undergraduate. I went to Barnard College in New York, and I had an internship at the Guggenheim Museum, and I had internships in graduate school,” Paul said. “It’s a great way to learn about these fields; you can use your knowledge of Art History and find out what kind of jobs there really are out there.”</p>\n<p>Intern supervisor of the ADA Museum program Mary McGuire said internship experience is beneficial for students seeking employment at museums.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job, and the other people at the museum, it’s their job too, to write letters if someone wants one,” McGuire said. “If they’ve been an intern and they’ve shown their dedication to the museum, they’ll get a good letter by the end of their internship.” </p>\n<p>Acting director of the ADA Museum and History of Art and Architecture professor E. Bruce Robertson said the internships provided by the new emphasis give students the chance to make personal connections with professors.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that’s a little hard at UCSB because it’s a big university is to have a really personalized education experience,” Robertson said. “So one of the incentives of being an intern at the Museum is that it offers an intensely personalized experience. You’re working very, very closely with knowledgeable professionals.”</p>\n<p>McGuire said he recently traveled to Los Angeles for a tour provided by Robertson, who used to work at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).</p>\n<p>“He gave us an amazing tour about a painter who he’s very well acquainted with, who he’s written about a lot, named Marsden Hartley, and his exhibition was up at LACMA,” McGuire said. “So we got this tour from Professor Robertson that was absolutely first-hand knowledge, both of the collection — where it came from, the setting in which it was installed in the museum — and the history of the painter.”</p>\n<p>Paul said she has been working with local museums, galleries and arts organizations such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and the Arts Fund to create internships for students.</p>\n<p>“The Museum on campus has a great internship program, but also my aim with this emphasis is to give students as many options as possible,” Paul said. “So we have options within the community here in Santa Barbara, such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and the Historical Museum, the Arts Fund, and students can even do it further afield in Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Paul also said there are many departments with courses that relate to the Museum Studies emphasis, as outlined in the Museum Studies prospectus.</p>\n<p>“History, as I said, Sociology, Geography, Chicana and Chicano Studies, Religious Studies even art works very well,” Paul said. “So I think that there are lots of other majors that compliment this really well.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/","id":2961,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[2960,2959,2958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Locals Protest UC-Wide Tuition Hike","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students and faculty gathered at the Day of Education and Activism event yesterday in the Arbor to protest the proposed UC tuition increase of five percent over the next five years.

The Day of Education and Activism event aimed to bring attention to the UC’s failure to submit proper expenditure reports under the Assembly Bill No. 94 (AB 94) signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in July 2013. </p>\n<p>According to Shari Sanders, Ph.D. candidate in comparative literature and the main organizer of Day of Education and Activism, students are unaware of the logistics behind the UC budget and must be educated on budget issues in order to prevent passive acceptance of tuition increases such as the increase to be approved by the UC Regents today. </p>\n<p>“The state of California has systematically been taking away education for decades,” Sanders said. “The last time students successfully opposed tuition increases was in 2009 and it is time to stand up in unity once more. If it were not for those student demonstrations, tuition would have been $15,000 more expensive.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said the UC has failed to fulfill its obligations via AB 94, which states that the UC must give reports breaking down expenditures for undergraduate and graduate student instruction and research. </p>\n<p>“Law AB 94 claims that the UC has to issue an accounting of where the money from the tuition goes and how it was spent,” Sanders said. “However, they recently failed to release this information to court and it has already been six weeks and nothing has been done.”</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology Aviva Milner-Brage said that her biggest concern with tuition increase is that low-income families and undocumented students are the ones most affected by the currently steep costs of attending a UC. </p>\n<p>“The undocumented students of low-income families are in tough situations,” Milner-Brage said,<br>\n“Their desire to earn degrees is so meaningful to them, and they have to fight even harder for their rights as students. It is not fair.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said she knew two students in a summer course who could not afford rent or a comfortable room to live in because of tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“In my summer class, out of 18 students, one student lived off a friend’s couch for $500 per month and one student was homeless,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>Milner-Brage said it is essential for Brown to fund the UC because the currently high rates of tuition are negatively affecting undergraduate and graduate students who will continue to face an increasing cost for public education.</p>\n<p>“The proposed five percent increase in tuition will only go higher as the years go by,” Sanders said. “Besides this, tuition has tripled the last fifteen years. Undergraduate and graduate students are affected alike, along with middle class families that do not qualify for financial aid.” </p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Gabriel Castro said although he is a recipient of financial aid, the tuition increases have continued to take a toll on his college career.</p>\n<p>“Grants and financial aid do not suffice,” Castro said. “I come from a low-income family. I’m going into debt with loans and it all places a large burden and pressure on me as a student.”</p>\n<p>According to Castro, many students face the challenge of graduating in debt and acquiring a job after graduation that does not fully pay back mounting student loans.</p>\n<p>“I, along with many of my college peers, am more discouraged to go to school each day knowing that my first job as a graduate will probably not cover everything that I owe,” Castro.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Edward Cruz said tuition increases have required him to have a very tight budget, negatively affecting his social life as well as his diet.</p>\n<p>“Because of my debt in loans … I cannot enjoy my evenings with friends at restaurants, movie theaters or concerts,” Cruz said. “This, more or less, ruins my college experience of going out with friends to nice things. On top of this, I cannot afford to buy groceries that are healthy.”</p>\n<p>According to feminist studies professor Eileen Boris, who spoke about topics at the event such as widespread difficulty to find a stable career, students can benefit from working together with professors in order to lower tuition as professors have prior experience with tuition increase issues and “depend on students to keep their careers afloat.”</p>\n<p>“Our jobs, as professors, would not exist without students,” Boris said. “It’s not only a moral and ethical reason to help students, it’s more about going against overpaid administrators that cause students to suffer financially. I’m also a parent which makes me more sensitive to the issue.”</p>\n<p>The event concluded with a march to Storke Tower, led by the Black Student Union (BSU). According to Sanders, the march served as an example that student protests cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>“I saw it as a wakeup call from apathy,” Sanders said. “It showed the strength of BSU student activists to make a sight that was impossible to ignore.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/","id":2956,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2955,2954,2953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It’s On Us Campaign Asks Students to Pledge Support","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s On Us, a national campaign to encourage students to help combat sexual violence, has been hosting a pledge drive at the Student Resources Building Lawn since Monday and will hold a rally in Sto...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s On Us, a national campaign to encourage students to help combat sexual violence, has been hosting a pledge drive at the Student Resources Building Lawn since Monday and will hold a rally in Stoke Plaza tomorrow at noon.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department along with Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.), It’s On Us campaigners have been giving out information regarding sexual violence and have been asking students to take a pledge to help prevent sexual assault since Monday and until today from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. At tomorrow’s rally in Storke Plaza, speakers will emphasize the vital role students play in addressing and combatting sexual assault.  </p>\n<p>CARE staff member and third-year sociology and College of Creative Studies literature major Emily Potter, who helped organize the event, said it is important that students participate in the campaign in light of recent incidences of sexual violence that have occurred to students on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Sexual assault is a huge problem on our campus. I think there’s statistics to say it’s even, percentage wise, worse on our campus than on other campuses,” Potter said. “We see 70 to 80 people come a year at C.A.R.E. to get support, and that’s just the people that come forward.”<br>\nAccording to Potter, the It’s On Us campaign aims to increase support for survivors of sexual violence and create an environment where sexual assault is never acceptable.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people just don’t realize how much we as a society and as a culture perpetuate this problem,” Potter said. “To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported, I think that’s ultimately what this campaign is doing. It starts sending a message out, especially to survivors, that we are supporting you, and I think all the other stuff will naturally follow that.” </p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and C.A.R.E. staff member Hannah Brown said a shift in societal perspective regarding sexual violence is needed throughout campus and in I.V. </p>\n<p>“There’s so much stigma on being a survivor, and almost no stigma on being an accused perpetrator,” Brown said, “We need to kind of shift that and say, ‘No. It’s not a bad thing to be a survivor. It’s a horrible thing to be a perpetrator.’”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, the campaign aims to be inclusive in order to incite widespread change regarding campus perspective on sexual violence. </p>\n<p>“We are trying really hard to make it a community building thing,” Brown said. “It’s about faculty and staff and students and Isla Vista and the community.  While we are focusing on UCSB, we want it to be a community-building thing. We’re not going to get any major changes if we don’t have everybody working together.” </p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Emma Burley, one of many students who have signed the pledge, said she is pleased that males are also participating in the campaign. </p>\n<p>“Living in a college community with a very party-heavy culture makes us more vulnerable for stuff like this,” Burley said. “I’m really glad to see that there are guys signing this pledge, too, especially since women tend to be more vocal about sexual assault, but it’s not just an issue for women. Men need to be involved in the conversation too.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/","id":2954,"author":{"id":173,"name":"Adelaide Burk"},"related":[2953,2952,2951],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Build Housing on Storke","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Preparations have begun for construction of San Joaquin Village, the first large-scale student housing project associated with the recently approved Long Ranged Development Plan after the California C...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58571\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58571\" data-attachment-id=\"58571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/sja-courtesy-of-housing-ucsb-edu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=480%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"480,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SJA courtesy of housing.ucsb.edu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=480%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58571 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?resize=480%2C306\" alt=\"An artist’s conception of the planned San Joaquin apartments, next to the existing Santa Catalina Residence Hall, which includes new dining commons.

Designed for upper-division undergraduate students, the apartments will include three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a living room. The complexes will also have study and recreation rooms, a small convenience store and a new dining commons. Additionally, on-site amenities will be provided to residents, including a playing field, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts and access to the existing swimming pool at Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>According to Julie Levangie, Multimedia Communications and Marketing Coordinator, the project will provide new housing for approximately 1,000 students, as well as four new residences for faculty members in the Faculty-in-Residence Program and renovations to the Portola Dining Commons inside Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited that the San Joaquin Apartments and Portola Dining Commons project has been approved by the Coastal Commission,” Levangie said. “This supports the terms of the recently approved Long Range Development Plan and its call for an increase in student housing.”</p>\n<p>Levangie said the project will meet the high standards of sustainability and environmental regulation associated with the university.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services strives to be good stewards of the environment and supporting UCSB on its way to becoming a sustainable community,” Levangie said. “The project has several sustainable design measures including storm water retention basin, energy efficient windows, and energy-star appliances for all kitchens.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher, the efforts to make San Joaquin Village sustainable will also include water and energy efficiency and reduced vehicle use on campus through an additional 24 Express bus line established in cooperation with the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>\n<p>“We will be using reclaimed water extensively, using the most up-to-date lighting technology, and naturally ventilating all of the living spaces,” Fisher said. “The project works to improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation in and around the site including street improvements on Storke and El Colegio Roads.”</p>\n<p>Fisher also said the San Joaquin Village’s building style will center around a theme of modern architecture and landscaping.</p>\n<p>“This will be a project with excellent architecture and a beautiful landscape of courtyards and paseos,” Fisher said. “The buildings are quite modern. This is a very exciting project in terms of its architecture and landscape.”</p>\n<p>According to Levangie, while the new university housing is roughly a mile from campus, she does not believe commuting will be a problem for residents.</p>\n<p>“As far as distance, residents will be a short 10 minute off-street bike ride from the middle of campus or a five minute bus ride to campus,” Levangie said.<br>\nFisher said he hopes the new apartments will encourage students to remain within university housing systems.</p>\n<p>“We believe this housing will provide students with a desirable alternative to apartments in Isla Vista,” Fisher said. “We hope that more students will choose to stay in on-campus housing during all of their years on our campus.”</p>\n<p>Allie Davidson, second-year biology major and residential assistant at Santa Rosa Hall, said the San Joaquin Village will help improve the housing situation for students on campus in light of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“With capacity for 1,000 residents, the San Joaquin apartments will certainly aid with current overcrowding of residence halls,” Davidson said. “I think the installment of these new resident apartments will have a positive impact on the students at UCSB, provided Housing and Residential Services continue their efforts in energy-saving and environmentally efficient machinery, lights and facilities.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This resolution calls for Senate to get the University of California Board of Regents to develop a plan to divest university funds currently invested in gun manufacturing industries by May 2015 and to execute this plan by December 2015.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Sydney Chanu read a letter on behalf of Bob Weiss, father of May 23 Isla Vista shooting victim Veronika Weiss. In the letter, Weiss condemned the alleged connection between the UC and gun manufacturers. </p>\n<p>“As parents of a victim of gun violence murder at University of California, it sickens us that the university could be invested in firearm manufacturers,” Chanu read, “With over 30,000 gun related deaths every year, and school shootings occurring almost monthly, the gun industry has blood on its hands.”</p>\n<p>Weiss also stated that it is vital students take a stance against gun violence as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>“University of California should act as a leader and ban investments in the gun industry,” Chanu read, “me and my wife ask you to divest now.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president Krishna Hammond also spoke in support of the bill and said students should investigate the amount of investments the university has tied in gun manufacturing industries.</p>\n<p>“It’s unconscionable that not only could we be financially tied to the gun industry that is directly responsible, but also that we don’t even know how much money were in the hole is,” Hammond said. </p>\n<p>Hammond also said students should urge the UC Regents to reevaluate their values in regard to where they invest their funds. </p>\n<p>“Frankly, it’s unimaginable that the Regents and the administration seems to operate as a Black Ops,” Hammond said. “[They are] invested in extremely negative industries and endeavors. I’m just here to help and ask all of you to vote to divest.”</p>\n<p>In addition, DJ Club president Easton Konn said A.S. misinformed him about A.S. Ticket Office logistics, resulting in the club’s denial of funds for transportation to their Waka Flocka Flame and IAmSu! concert at the Earl Warren Showground this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve been happy using A.S. Ticketing. I think it’s a great system. I had no issue with it, neither did anyone in my organization,” Konn said. “The only issue is we were never told that we had to use it. We were actually told the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Konn, without A.S. funding for buses he will have to deny thousands of students transportation to Saturday’s concert. </p>\n<p>“It’s just really upsetting right now because we have a thousand people on the line, depending on these buses,” Konn said. “I have no idea how to go to all these kids tomorrow and tell them that they can’t get to this concert. I don’t know how to tell them they don’t have buses.”<br>\nSenator and Chairman of the Finance Board Jimmy Villarreal said miscommunication occurred between the DJ Club and A.S., but that regardless he did know if A.S. should fund the buses at all. </p>\n<p>“The initial presentation was basically, ‘Well we don’t want all these kids drunk driving, so let’s get a bus for them.’ We’re paying for those buses,” Villarreal said. “Do we want to be kind of complicit with all these drunk kids going somewhere in the first place? That’s just a lot of liability that maybe we don’t want to be a part of.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article mistakenly stated the meeting took place on Tuesday, though the intended day was Wednesday.

Hamner said philanthropy is essential to helping raise UCSB’s national ranking.</p>\n<p>“We really encourage students to give back to the school once they graduate,” Hamner said. “Even if a student gives one dollar or five dollars, it ups our ranking because it shows alumni involvement.”</p>\n<p>According to Fenton, UCSB First will also use Food Truck Cinema as a platform to announce the senior class gift, which was voted upon by members of this year’s senior class. The winning result, Fenton said, will determine which of three options on the ballot will have a fund opened on its behalf at the end of the school year: Associated Students Food Bank, A.S. Academic Resource Fund or the Student Safety Enhancement Fund.</p>\n<p>“[A senior class gift] is an opportunity for seniors to create a legacy and stay connected with their alma mater,” Fenton said. “UC Santa Barbara is a strong community, and giving to this gift demonstrates our firm belief in Gauchos helping Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>UCSB First is also partnering with the Associate Students Food Bank by recommending that attendees bring canned food donations to the event, according to A.S. Food Bank coordinator and alumna Tuyen Nguyen.</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said 10 percent of the proceeds from the food trucks will also go to A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“If there is something in the back of your pantry that you are willing and able to part with, it could always be used to help other students who utilize our pantry,” Nguyen said. “We also encourage [buying food] in whatever capacity people can engage and be able to give back.”</p>\n<p>Food Truck Cinema, Fenton said, will also be hosting tabling from various student organizations like Dance Marathon, Active Minds, DJ Club and the Education Abroad Program.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to provide more fun things for students to do,” Fenton said. “This is an opportunity for students to learn more about their campus and where they can get involved in.”</p>\n<p>According to Hamner, deciding what movie to screen was a difficult decision due to factors like appropriateness and popularity.</p>\n<p>“It actually took such a long time to pick a movie because we wanted to do a film that everyone would like and be able to relate to,” Hamner said.</p>\n<p>In the end, “Anchorman” was the right choice, according to Fenton.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a fun movie and kind of nostalgic to most people,” Fenton said. “Plus everyone loves Will Ferrell.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the event would provide free food to attendees.

I hope they learn something new and I hope that the statistics will shock them into an awareness about what is happening around them.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi president and fourth-year psychology major Brenda Santamaria said she hopes that students in attendance were educated by the event and were reminded that “we as women, as humans, should be caring for everyone equally.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that they learned that women around the world face issues that maybe here in the United States aren’t issues,” Santamaria said. “It’s really important to appreciate what we are offered and what other people are not.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Autumn LaTour said after viewing the “Honor Diaries” documentary and hearing Raza and Sanghera speak, she plans to become further involved in the fight for equality for women.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really meaningful to everybody, and not just women, in our society, to become involved in these issues and make sure these issues are talked about and incorporated to promote equality for women,” LaTour said. “I’m planning on becoming an “Honor Diaries” ambassador because most people aren’t aware of these issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Raza, educating students about oppression in honor-based societies is the first step toward promoting change to help “eradicate the problem” of abuse and that social progress depends on individual actions.</p>\n<p>“Unless you speak out,” Raza said. “There won’t be change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58410\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58410\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/","id":2953,"author":{"id":172,"name":"Teddy Krolczyk"},"related":[2952,2951,2950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The event involves male members of various Greek Life organizations competing for the title of Mr. Greek Universe. The event fell under scrutiny by some members of the finance board.</p>\n<p>The first objector to the re-allocation of funding for the event came from Senator Steven Kwok who raised the issue of whether or not the planned desserts were in line with A.S. regulations regarding the funding of sustainable food.</p>\n<p>“My issue with the desserts is that they are primarily going to spend it on brownies from Costco,” Kwok said. “That does not meet the Green Bill to the best of my knowledge, so I don’t think we should be funding that portion of the re-allocation. Fifty percent of the food that you buy has to be from sustainable sources.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said she took issue with the possible exclusivity of the event.</p>\n<p>“The only people allowed to compete are Greek so if they’re getting money, that seems unfair,” Blant said. “Is there any way that stipulates that any and all competitions have to be all inclusive?”</p>\n<p>Senator Casey Firenze disagreed with Blant and said that if an event is open to all students as spectators, that is enough to qualify it for student funding, regardless of whether or not event participation is inclusive or not.</p>\n<p>“I just want to say about the whole Greek system thing, I thought that we were in agreement that if anyone can come watch it, it’s fine,” Firenze said. “And anyone can come watch.”</p>\n<p>Blant contended and said that an event that is open is not necessarily open enough.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, just open to attend is not inclusive enough,” said Blant.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Jasmine Moses said she was personally offended by Blant’s suggestion to not fund events primarily targeting a Greek community audience because of her membership in Greek Life organizations.</p>\n<p>“The way in which you said [that Mr. Greek Universe should not be funded], it made me feel some type of way because I am in the Greek community,” Moses said.<br>\nAfter discussion, the Board passed a motion granting the re-allocation of $160 for food and desserts, but not for sashes or a crown.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association requested $1,100 to hold a dating game show event in Corwin Pavilion. According to CSSA representatives, the matchmaking event would feature several singles answering questions about their relationship goals in front of an audience and being assigned potential dates.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Kherishma Shah did not approve of the event, questioning its value to the overall student population.</p>\n<p>“Personally I don’t see how this event would benefit UCSB in any way possible,” Shah said. It’s pretty much watching people, like, meet, that’s all it is.”<br>\nFinance Officer Jerel Constantino supported funding the CSSA’s event and said the Finance committee is responsible for financing events for a diverse range of students with different cultural backgrounds and entertainment preferences.</p>\n<p>“We all know this event is catered toward the international community, right? And I don’t know about you guys but my mom is from an East Asian country, this show is familiar to me,” Constantino said. “I think for us to tell [CSSA] this isn’t entertainment, that’s kind of ripping on their culture. It might not be fun for you, but it’s fun for the Chinese students who show up, who are also paying into student fees and who are also part of this community.”<br>\nThe Finance Board eventually approved $844 in funding for CSSA’s event.</p>\n<p>A Community Affairs Board request for $230 in re-allocation for buying toys for children living in Storke Family Housing and $1,850 funding request for toys for local children by the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity also sparked debate among the members of the committee.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Haley Ferrera proposed that both initiatives come with a stipulation that the funding be used for purchasing gender-neutral toys.<br>\nChief Finance Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus objected on the basis that if the committee required the stipulation, it would be overstepping its bounds as a purely financial organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m all down for gender-neutral toys, but I feel like a lot of our personal beliefs on things is kind of getting pushed on these groups and their organizations. Like a male beauty pageant is hella bad in some spaces, they find that very heteronormative,” Theus said. “If we start with one group, I feel like we have to start doing an inclusivity check on all events. That’s a precedent we will have to start following.”</p>\n<p>Both CAB and Sigma Chi Omega were granted their requests with a recommendation, but not stipulation, from A.S. asking that funds be used for gender-neutral toys.</p>\n<p>Other notable motions passed included $1,970 in funding to the Swing and Ballroom Dancing Club for an event winter quarter, $3,200 to La Familia de Colores for plane tickets to an LGBTQ event in Denver and $3,000 to the Women’s Club Soccer team to help cover expenses related to participating in a national championship tournament in Memphis.</p><div

continuation of the Pollock Theater series “Focus On: The Editor,” House of Cards editor Byron Smith, gave a lecture Thursday on the importance of the editor in the process of producing an online television series.</p>\n<p>Following a screening of the first episode of the second season of the show, for which Byron was nominated for 2014 Emmy for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Smith gave a lecture and opened the floor for questions form the audience.</p>\n<p>Smith spoke briefly about how this Internet-based distribution of House of Cards content distinguished itself from other established forms of storytelling. He also said he felt Netflix was changing the way people think of and approach television.</p>\n<p>“I feel we’re re-inventing episodic. We don’t call it television anymore,” Smith said. “We’re in a whole new world in terms of how people are absorbing entertainment. Cinema is very important and I’m very passionate about it, but we also watch [shows] on our phones and on tablets.”</p>\n<p>According to Smith, production occurred in spurts of shooting 20 days at a time — 10 per episode — with an average cost of production clocking in at $250,000 a day. Smith also said working on House of Cards demands an editor that can “cut” almost 120 pages of script in 21 days, an expectation he described as “crazy.”</p>\n<p>“Directors do two episodes at a time,” Smith explained. “Not just one episode anymore. It’s all in the name of being more efficient. I’m usually paired with that director for the two episodes and so I’m cutting two episodes. Simultaneously … I now live in a world where I’m constantly worried about keeping up to camera — and that’s cutting as fast as they shoot.”</p>\n<p>To keep up with the pace of production, Smith said he relies on a new editing software, which he demonstrated on stage. The software allows anyone involved in production, including directors and producers, to access to the files, view edited shots and make frame-by-frame comments and notes, allowing Smith to receive immediate feedback.</p>\n<p>“There’s an extraordinary amount of power you have in the cutting room,” Smith said. “I’ve been told several times ‘make something out of nothing; save this,’ or ‘fix this.’ You’ve got to start with a good script, and re-write the script, and re-write that re-write. Make sure you have the best possible story first, and put time into the script. But when you cut it, it now exists in a visual form; it’s not just a book anymore.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nick subscribes to the Indiana Jones school of journalism.”</p>\n<p>Kristof’s newly published book, co-written with his wife Sheryl WuDunn, A Path Appears, addresses one of the constraints of global philanthropic efforts, which Kristof describes as “an empathy gap.”</p>\n<p>“The starting point is to chip away at this distance, build a broader scope of empathy and agreement,” Kristof said. “When you encounter need, you respond. Poverty is not just an economic failing, it is a moral failing on the part of people who can help.”</p>\n<p>Kristof said while “there is a deep human yearning for silver bullets,” in reality it takes a consistent effort of small actions to “collectively have an impact” on global crises.</p>\n<p>“It’s because of this kind of change that I believe extreme poverty is going to be eliminated on our watch,” Kristof said. “I’m a great believer in education, in my opinion it’s the best escalator out of poverty. But when we have tools and knowledge that would transform the lives of children and we don’t implement them, there is a real irresponsibility on the part of society as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, the tendency of journalists to “avoid … hopefulness” has created a flaw within news reporting.</p>\n<p>“We leave the impression that Africa is crashing when in fact there are amazing things going on,” Krisof said. “The problem is that the worst in the world is often next to the best. We need to convey triumphs as well as disasters of human conviction.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said people and governments fail to use all the tools available to address crises, such as the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.</p>\n<p>“We should have learned from AIDS,” Kristof said. “You have to intervene early, but there was no rush with Ebola partially due to indifference. We could have stopped [Ebola] at a huge saving of money and lives.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said he is concerned with the public disinterest in current news, discussing an ABC TV special on global health and the subsequent cancellation of the special.</p>\n<p>“The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation had bribed ABC to cover global health issues, and by bribe I mean a grant,” Kristof said. “After one series, ABC News said that they didn’t want the money from the foundation anymore because viewers switched the channel when these programs came on. Is there no business model to cover really important stories?”</p>\n<p>Kristof said he predicts the reporting and covering of important stories will decline further in the coming decade.</p>\n<p>“If you think we’ve dropped the ball in the last 10 years, it will get worse in the next ten years,” Kristof said.</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, George Clooney was a “terrific travel partner” during their time traveling to Darfur, Sudan, in 2009, where Clooney hoped to draw media attention to the genocide in Darfur.</p>\n<p>“We shared a room in Darfur that has a huge bloodstain on the wall, it was never explained,” Kristof said. “When we involved celebrities in our novel we were worried it would cheapen issues, but at the end of the day it is difficult to get people’s attentions to these issues.”</p>\n<p>Political science graduate student Shannon Schumacher, who participated in the Q&amp;A portion of the lecture, said that while she was a “little bit disappointed” by the lack of structure in Kristof’s argument, she expressed appreciation that Kristof offered solutions to the problems he presented.</p>\n<p>“Some key points I really did enjoy were his comments on his idea of the empathy gap and trying to generate how can people see things from other sides and how can we as individuals really feel empowered to help,” Schumacher said. “I like that he offered suggestions of how to do that but I was looking for a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Recent alumnus and former biology major Andrew Floren was able to speak with Kristof before the lecture, which he said offered him a “unique perspective” on topics discussed during the lecture.</p>\n<p>“I asked him how he keeps his idealism and he kind of touched upon it,” Floren said. “‘It’s being out in the field and doing a lot of work,’ [he said] and I just looked him in the eye and I understood because I’ve been out in the field as well internationally and it’s something where once you see that, you can’t look away you can’t ignore it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies and communication major Katie Koerper said while the lecture did not give her a clear idea of what she will pursue after graduation, Kristof’s lecture “reignites the fire of really wanting to help people.”</p>\n<p>“I think this is very inspiring for me because I hear, as well as study, a lot about these topics,” Koerper said.<br>\nWhile concluding his lecture, Kristof said each individual has their own “spotlight” they can use to move change in the world.</p>\n<p>“Whether it be your Twitter, Facebook, book clubs or bulletin boards,” Kristof said. “Use these lights to shed information on the important issues. As we drop the ball, I hope you guys can pick it back up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/","id":2975,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2974,2973,2972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fair Fights Mental Health Stigmas","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Active Minds and Associated Students jointly held “Stigma Free UCSB” yesterday in Storke Plaza to facilitate discussion between students, staff and mental health professionals about issues surroun...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58285\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stigma-free-by-Christina-DeMarzo-0038.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1463415558\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58282\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58285\" data-attachment-id=\"58285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/fair-fights-mental-health-stigmas/stigma-free-by-christina-demarzo-0038/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stigma-free-by-Christina-DeMarzo-0038.jpg?fit=1200%2C747&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,747\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415889940\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"210\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stigma-free by Christina DeMarzo-0038\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stigma-free-by-Christina-DeMarzo-0038.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stigma-free-by-Christina-DeMarzo-0038.jpg?fit=888%2C552&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58285 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stigma-free-by-Christina-DeMarzo-0038-1024x637.jpg?resize=614%2C381\" alt=\"Students gaze at the Stigma Free banner that was signed by participants of the event.

(<em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Members of the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) were in attendance during public forum of the Associated Students Senate meeting last night to combat a bill that would reduce S.C.O.R.E.’s decision-making authority regarding the planning of the Student of Color Conference (S.O.C.C.), shifting authority instead to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. is a campus organization that advocates for the rights for students of color and other underrepresented communities, and S.O.C.C. is a UC Students Association conference held this past weekend at UC Merced in which students discuss, among other topics, issues surrounding race. The controversial bill will be headed to the External Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow night to be voted on.</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt said the bill unfairly shifts the ability to organize S.O.C.C attendance to the EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s my understanding that it would be pulled out of S.C.O.R.E.’S jurisdiction to organize and put into the EVPSA’s,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this is wrong because S.C.O.R.E. has historically organized the Student of Color Conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. member Leilani Riahi said the commission has always served minority students and that putting power in the hands of a non-minority would be detrimental to the students of color community.</p>\n<p>“The people in S.C.O.R.E. have always been there to serve this one purpose,” Riahi said. “They’re doing it for others. I know these people, I’ve seen them, worked with them to be elected to this space. You have to have communities of color in mind. Always. We’re already so marginalized, we already don’t have enough power in these fucking institutions, and to institutionalize racism … just give us this conference.”</p>\n<p>Bettencourt also said there was a lack of diversity on campus and that it is important to keep the power within the S.C.O.R.E. to compensate for the imbalance.</p>\n<p>“I believe our school has the least diversity of any other school and because of that, it is more necessary and pertinent than ever that the Student Commission on Racial Equality continues to organize this,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this Student of Color Conference falls directly under the mission of S.C.O.R.E. which is to educate people about the issues that affects students of color and to organize around those issues.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58250\" style=\"width: 579px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"800180484\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58217\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58250\" data-attachment-id=\"58250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/as-senate-by-kenneth-song_for-11-12-2014-7778/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=1200%2C817&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,817\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415834446\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate by Kenneth Song_for 11.12.2014-7778\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58250\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778-1024x697.jpg?resize=569%2C386\" alt=\"(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"569\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Second year pre-biology major and S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator Kyron Covington said it is essential that students of color organize S.O.C.C attendance and quoted Malcolm X, stating that “only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to condemn the proposed bill to take S.O.C.C away from S.C.O.R.E. because I would be a fool to let it happen,” Covington said. “For people that are new to these issues or ideas of social justice and problems that affect my community, I won’t let anyone else teach them because I know my community best. S.O.C.C. is organized by students of color because we would be fools otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur said that if the bill is passed and the committee created to choose S.C.O.R.E attendees is occupied by Caucasian students, it would contradict the purpose of S.C.O.R.E and their conference.</p>\n<p>“This five person committee y’all are suggesting could be all white, besides these S.C.O.R.E. co-chairs,” Kaur said. “It’s never acceptable for a majority white board to organize who gets to go to the Students of Color Conference.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is not in favor of this bill, at least not in the current language it is written in.</p>\n<p>“I think the conference bill, the language needs to be clarified,” Singh said. “I think people are getting the misconception that I for some reason want to take over these conferences, that’s not what’s happening. I’m personally opposed to anything that takes power from any AS entities, like that’s not what I envision that bill to be.”</p>\n<p>A version of the story appeared on page 4 of the Nov. 13, 2014 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Williams, the roundtable ended with an “overwhelming consensus” that campuses must do more to protect students.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the rate of sexual violence on college campuses is “unacceptable,” citing that one in five students are estimated to be the victims of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“Nothing has really been done, at least effectively, to address campus sexual violence,” Jackson said. “[I’m] mad as hell about this situation … This is simply unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, Williams has made extensive efforts to address sexual violence on campus by developing the two-part roundtable discussion with his committee and by co-authoring a legislative bill that calls for more action from college campuses to address sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“We really need to address this problem through education, prevention, deterrence, treatment and action,” Jackson said. “Those who are found to have violated what is I think … is simply an appropriate code of conduct need to have drastic steps taken to punish and discourage that behavior going forward.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she is in support of legislative efforts toward ensuring that those who sexually assault individuals are rightfully prosecuted.</p>\n<p>“Yes needs to mean yes,” Jackson said. “We can no longer accept a culture that excuses rape, that condones rape, that protects rape or sexual violence anywhere, let alone on our college campuses.”</p>\n<p>One heavily discussed topic during the roundtable regarded the process by which non-UCSB student perpetrators are currently dealt with and how that process can be improved. According to Associate Dean for Student Wellness Angela Andrade, the university may look at cases where non-students are sexually assaulted or harassed, but can only administer punishments to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We look at those cases and see if there’s anything we can do, but ultimately … our campus regulations [only] gives us the authority to discipline students that are enrolled at UCSB,” Andrade said.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Partee, the Dean of Educational Programs at Santa Barbara City College, said that while SBCC does not have their own police team to enforce anti-sexual assault policies, the college maintains good communication with the SBCC Office of Student Life, Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the Santa Barbara County Police Department and UCSB Police Department.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re going in the right direction as two entities that have individual students in Isla Vista,” Partee said, “and it’s our hope that we can help eliminate the assaults.”</p>\n<p>Katie, a UCSB student and sexual assault victim who chose to withhold her last name for personal reasons, said her experience working with the university was entirely positive, in terms of academic accommodations and understanding her options, but that problems arose along the way.</p>\n<p>“My real issues didn’t start until the investigation got underway with law enforcement,” Katie said.</p>\n<p>Katie said she made the report because she did not want to be one of the many victims of assault who do not have their case heard. However, Katie said she encountered “a lot of insensitivity” in the way IVFP dealt with her case.</p>\n<p>“It was just a process of re-victimization,” Katie said. “I feel like I went through way more pain than I needed to and had to tell way more people my story. Things don’t get to a hearing because there are so many reasons that people are discouraged before having a chance to get to there.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said that sometimes officers working with sexual assault and harassment victims fail to handle the situation out of a lack of understanding and experience.</p>\n<p>“We need to continue to work on that training and to make an effort to build that relationship and improve our abilities to work with the survivors of these assaults,” Signa said. “It’s an ongoing process, we’re not perfect. We’re trying to do the best we can. We need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she applauds progress made to combat sexual assault and harassment cases on campus, but that they are only beginning and that more serious punishment for perpetrators are in order.</p>\n<p>“[Students] are going to be our leaders in the future, and if we cannot do that then we have failed the university,” Jackson said. “We will have failed our young people, both men and women, and we will not be doing our job.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said she feels frustrated that, despite years of activism, not enough has been done to establish a “culture of no excuses.”</p>\n<p>“There’s no excuse for rape. There is no excuse for blaming the victim and there is no excuse for not supporting the victim and prosecuting … whether it’s the criminal context or whether it’s in the university,” Jackson said. “Someone who commits rape should not be a student at the University of California and should not be a student at Santa Barbara City College or any of our schools of higher education.”</p>\n<p>A

serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The California Coastal Commission approved UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) Thursday, which will add 5,000 undergraduate students and hundreds of faculty and staffers to the university by 2025.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The LRDP, also called ‘Vision 2025,’ was prepared by university officials after reviewing projected enrollment demands and analyzing limitations of campus, traffic, expenses and feedback from the community. Coastal Commission staff member Shana Grey presented the plan, which details a one percent annual enrollment increase until 2025 to a maximum enrollment of 25,000 students. The current LRDP was created in 1990 and the new drafts were released in March 2008, followed by a public hearing in June 2008.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The new plan will involve campus development, including changes in academic programs and increased campus housing for students, faculty and staff. According to a LRDP statement, the additional housing developments could exacerbate issues related to water usage, traffic circulation and greenhouse gas emissions but have held public hearings extending public comment on the development. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">California Coastal Commission Vice-Chair Jana Zimmer said university officials and environmental consultants discussed issues concerning the higher demand of water supply a larger student population would cause.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">We discussed the water supply issue at some length,” Zimmer said. “There is additional capacity in the reclaimed water system that is about one-half capacity now.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher said considerations for additional parking space will be a crucial aspect to the development plan.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Transportative systems and alternative transportation as opposed to vehicular and loads of transportation that we are accustomed to and the role of parking in the whole analysis is critically important,” Fisher said. “I hope that we will have an Isla Vista parking program as part of the county update to the Isla Vista master plan.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Deputy Director of the South Central Coast District John Ainsworth said the renewal of the LRDP was difficult but successful.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The preparation of this review LRDP update has been a long, and let me say, complicated process, stretching out over a number of years,” Ainsworth said. “The staff, the university, and the coalition of environmental groups are all now in agreement — and this is a huge achievement in my view.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the UC Regents as well as faculty members from Goleta and Santa Barbara have been supportive of the LRDP. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">During the past 10 years we have gone through very thorough, very collaborative, extremely consultative, transparent and public processes,” Yang said. “Our LRDP plan had the approval in full support from University of California Regents, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and Goleta City Council.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Yang, the LRDP was drafted with consideration for the surrounding community in mind. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">We have held 65 public meetings leading up to the plans submittal to the Coastal Commission,” Yang said. “We have invited and implemented an extraordinary amount of community input.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Applications to the university have doubled in the last decade and enrollment has been capped at 20,000 for several years. At the end of today’s meeting, the California Coastal Commission decided to approve the plan for increased enrollment and more housing. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a

group Life Legal Defense Foundation.</p></div>\n<p>A civil lawsuit was filed last week against UCSB by pro-life student advocates Life Legal Defense Foundation (LLDF) who claim the university did not pursue disciplinary action against feminist studies associate professor Mireille Miller-Young, who assaulted Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust protesters earlier this year.</p>\n<p>In March, pro-life advocacy group Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust held a protest demonstration in the Arbor that ended with Miller-Young engaging in a verbal exchange with the protesters as well as the theft of their materials and a scratch on the arm of 16-year-old protester Catherine Short. According to the formal complaint filed by attorneys, Catherine Short and LLDF member Allison Arranda, the UC Regents never contacted or apologized to any of the plaintiffs regarding the case. Following the incident, Vice-Chancellor Michael Young sent out an email warning students about non-students promoting personal agendas in an effort to provoke individuals on campus.</p>\n<p>The suit also names recent alumnae Briana Brown and alumna Erika Ito as defendants in the case. The brief describes the actions of the defendants as “willful, wanton, malicious and oppressive” and done in “reckless disregard” of Short and her fellow protesters’ rights.</p>\n<p>In a press release, LLDF President Dana Cody stated that Miller-Young did not conduct herself in a manner consistent with her profession.</p>\n<p>“This is a mature, supposedly educated woman charged by the University of California to convey knowledge, and instead she conveyed discrimination and intolerance,” Cody stated. “Not only was she out of line in attacking students, but she literally drew blood from a minor.”</p>\n<p>In August, Miller-Young was found guilty of misdemeanor vandalism and battery, and was sentenced to 108 hours of community service and three years of probation.</p>\n<p>The complaint was filed to “vindicated [the plaintiff’s] own rights and rights of others” to engage in free speech on a public university campus.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs did not consent to the Defendants’ acts and found them to be harmful and offensive to their person and dignity,” the complaint stated. “Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages, including but not limited to emotional distress, fear, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, physical pain, damage to property, and loss of reputation.”</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, the defendant violated the first, fourth and fourteenth amendment of the Constitution, as well as California Civil Codes 51.7, which guarantees all persons within the jurisdiction of California have the right to be free from any violence or intimidation by threat of violence because of political affiliation.</p>\n<p>According to the California Civil Code, a person may be liable to pay $25,000 in civil damages for denying or conspiring to deny a person’s right under 51.7.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President as well as university administration declined comment on the pending litigation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/pro-life-group-files-lawsuit-against-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/pro-life-group-files-lawsuit-against-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/pro-life-group-files-lawsuit-against-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/pro-life-group-files-lawsuit-against-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/pro-life-group-files-lawsuit-against-ucsb/","id":2968,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2967,2966,2965],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":75,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
