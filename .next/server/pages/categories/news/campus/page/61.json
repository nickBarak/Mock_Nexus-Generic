Raza Week will also include events such as a potluck, movie night and a Salsa night with organizations such as the Pan-African Student Union, El Congresso and La Familia de Colores.</p>\n<p>Hermanas Unidas representative and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Regina Ramirez said Hermanas Unidas hosted Raza Week to provide organizations with an opportunity to network.</p>\n<p>“We can be such a big support system for one another, mostly being women, and mostly being underrepresented,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>Ramirez said she was “really excited” about co-hosting Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between because it brought diverse women together to share their experiences.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between is “empowering” and motivating for students who may struggle at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of struggles that we as women of color go through, not just with academics, but also how we see ourselves within campus,” Ramirez said. “It’s really helpful because we’re sharing our experiences.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi Multicultural Chair, Co-host of the event and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Carina Garibay said she feels categorized by her ethnicity instead of individual qualities. According to Garibay, university environments would benefit from professors and other faculty properly considering the needs of women of color.</p>\n<p>“Professors have such an influence on how we feel on campus as well, as women and as women of color,” Garibay said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Patsy Solano said women of color often feel out of place as science, technology, math and engineering majors.</p>\n<p>“We’re looked down upon and not given much hope,” Solano said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and sociology double-major Casandra Phillips said institutional changes should include “seeing more women and women of color at a higher level” to promote students utilizing their resources.</p>\n<p>According to Phillips, women of color should not “victimize themselves.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, we are women of color, but we’re just people like everyone else,” Phillips said. “I don’t have to prove anything to anyone but myself, I’m here for myself.”</p>\n<p>Third-year linguistics and sociology double-major Nora Rosales said the event opened doors for women to start new conversations.</p>\n<p>“If there isn’t any representation of people that look like us, or people who think like us, or been through the things we’ve been through, then how the hell are they supposed to help us?” Rosales said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Regina Ramirez is a part of Sigma Theta Psi, however she is a representative of Hermanas Unidas and not a member of the sorority.

F&amp;B) met Monday in the UCen State Street room to consider 10 funding requests from nine campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $34,000 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665.26 in Senate unallocated, $45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $45,000 in Culture Weeks and Graduations, $27,000 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams. A.S. F&amp;B fully granted five requests, partially granted one request, tabled two requests and declined funding for one request.</p>\n<p>Kapatirang Pilipino (KP) requested $730 for Filipino Visibility Week, which begins Nov. 9 and will include an open-mic night, a parol (Filipino Christmas lantern) making workshop, a Justice for Filipino-Americans March in L.A., a carnival and Filipino cuisine throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A KP representative said the week’s events will portray the academic, cultural, social and political pillars of the organization.</p>\n<p>“We try to have events that really enforce the pillars of our organization, so we are here to ask for funding for our Filipino Visibility Week,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group on the condition that the $160 initially requested for decorations and arts and crafts would be used solely for parol-making supplies.</p>\n<p>American Indian Student Mentor Association representatives Dayoung Yun and Marisol Alamillo requested $6,000 for their annual harvest festival.</p>\n<p>Yun said the annual festival is for native students and allies who are unable to go home for the holidays. According to Yun, the goal of the festival is to celebrate native identity and unite native students with their culture.</p>\n<p>“The event originated in 1975 when some native students couldn’t go home for Thanksgiving, so we began to offer an alternative for those students,” Yun said. “It’s a safe space for our native students and allies and every student is welcome to attend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request until next week to discuss the use of the organization’s one-time exception clause in the allocation of funds.</p>\n<p>Pi Sigma Rho representative Bharat Raman requested $170 for an outreach barbeque.</p>\n<p>Raman said the event is for potential members of the physics honors society.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of this event would be to interact with prospective new members, get people to join,” Raman said. “We’re speaking to freshman physics classes which have hundreds of students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said the committee cannot fund “recruitment events.”</p>\n<p>“Since the event is for physics students with certain requirements, it is more of a recruitment event than an open-student event,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted unanimously to decline funding to the organization based on the nature of the event.</p>\n<p>Cultura Arts representative Marla Arciniega requested $705 to fund their annual Dia de los Muertos event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe representatives Kai Kawashina and Sheila Ho requested $98 to hold a Uri Uri workshop and karaoke night/potluck.</p>\n<p>Kawashina said the events are a way for American students learning about Japanese culture or language to interact with international students from Japan.</p>\n<p>“The students from Japan can teach the American students who are learning Japanese or Japanese culture,” Kawashina said. “It’s a community to learn about Japanese culture using Japanese language”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to bundle and fully fund the two events.</p>\n<p>UCSBreaking representatives Christina Chong, Chris Pom and Steven Hu requested $1,350 to host a breakdancing competition at UCSB. They requested $1050 for judges and DJs, and $300 for prize money.</p>\n<p>Hu said the event is a way the group to gain recognition as a breakdancing club.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to get people interested in our club and it allows us to expand our club,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund their request, excluding the prize money, because it is against precedent to allot prize money to an organization.</p>\n<p>Lambda Sigma Gamma requested $1,300 to hold a Mr. Greek Universe pageant to raise money for their national philanthropy: California Head Start Program. The event is open to all of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>A Lambda Sigma Gamma student representative said the event is a way to encourage inter-Greek relations while raising money for a cause that helps young students across the state.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the fundraiser event, under the condition that all UCSB would be free to participate and attend the event.</p>\n<p>Afrikan Black Coalition student representatives Gold Okafor and Odera Anakwenze requested $30,000 for an annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference held on Feb. 12 to Feb. 14 that spans the whole UC system. It was last held at UCSB in 2007 with 400 people. This year, Afrikan Black Coalition anticipates 900 people will be in attendance.</p>\n<p>Okafor said the conference is a way for black students on campus to gather as a community and learn about the way their community interacts with the world. Students will also learn from prominent black public figures about future professional success. Student will learn about the theme of the event, “Planting the seeds of the future, planning our next steps.“</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that black people on our campus and anyone in our community feel welcome here and are able to see each other and really flourish,” Okafor said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the event, with $15,000 from the OSL funds and $15,000 from the Culture weeks and graduation funds for the Winter 2016 quarter.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness Liaisons for the Residence Hall Association (RHA) Jose Magana and Paloma Hinojosa requested $2,474 to install condom dispensers in each of UCSB’s residential halls. Currently, students in the residence halls may obtain condoms by requesting them from their hall’s Safe Sex Peer or Residence Hall Advisors.</p>\n<p>Magana and Hinojosa said the goal of the dispensers would be to make condoms more accessible for the general student body and promote safer sex.</p>\n<p>“There’s a stigma for going to another person to get a condom, even the Safe Sex Peers, and we want to eliminate that stigma. We want to put the dispensers somewhere where all students will have access to them.”</p>\n<p>The committee had concerns about the safety of the dispensers, and voted to table the request indefinitely as A.S. representative works collaboratively with RHA to create a safer, more functional condom dispenser plan.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the new policy, any University employee who is not a “confidential resource” — including resident assistants, teaching assistants and any other student employees</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who hears about possible sexual assault must notify the Title IX office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a draft of the policy sent to UC campuses, University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has asked faculty, staff and students from all UC campuses to review the 25-page policy and submit comments by the end of October, after which UC’s Policy Work Group will review the suggestions and complete a final draft by January 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UConsent Coordinator, Take Back the Night Co-Chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan helped organize the forum and said it was important to hold an event during which a variety of people could have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted different perspectives from all different groups and backgrounds,” Morgan said. “Because we are educated on [the policy], we might not be able to come up with questions or not be able to get out of a certain tunnel vision, so it’s great to have all these different perspectives telling us what their concerns are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Director of C.A.R.E. Briana Conway said organizations need to hear specific student needs in order to best serve them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best of intentions — through policy and administration — if [they are] not speaking to the population who we’re trying to serve, then we’re failing,” Conway said. “I love opportunities like this where we can bridge administration’s best efforts with what really speaks to our student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Graduate Student Association Vice President of Committees and Planning Timothy Irvine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who helped organize the event, the new policy would mean that survivors who do not wish to report an incident would have fewer options for confidants, seeing as many people are now required to report such information to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It reduces the amount of people who the survivor can confide in because they know if they do confide in this person, they’re putting them in a terribly awkward position,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jennifer Selvidge said it creates a unique problem for graduate students and teaching assistants who may be friends with their undergraduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as graduate students and we as TAs should not be mandatory reporters so that students do have an option to confide in their friends and people they may view as their friends, like their TAs,” Selvidge said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title IX coordinator Ricardo Alcaíno said the policy would not automatically lead the Title IX office to pursue the case if, for example, more damage would be caused to the survivor by launching an investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like if someone is a responsible employee and they report it, we’re off to the races,” Alcaíno said. “It’s so no students on campus feel like there’s nothing to do. That’s the most important thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morgan, one of the “largest weaknesses” of the proposal is the absence of a mandatory minimum suspension for perpetrators. During a 13-hour sit-in in May, #NowUCSB campaigned for a four-quarter minimum suspension of students convicted of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irvine said the document should include mandatory minimum suspensions to warn students that there will be serious actions taken against perpetrators of sexual violence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of this is that people would know there will be consequences, because, so often, there are no consequences,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said that a mandatory suspension may impact whether or not survivors choose to report an incident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most survivors want to know what’s going to happen to the respondent,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said. “That may determine if they’re going to come forward or how much they’re going to tell us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said the efforts of students, including the #NowUCSB sit-in, are resulting in more progressive policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so proud and honored to be a part of UCSB,” Conway said. “Students are at the center of all of this. I think student activism is what’s driving change at a large university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forum’s organizers plan to set up a public Google Doc where anyone can suggest changes to the policy draft. These suggestions will then be submitted to UC’s Policy Work Group, which is currently drafting the final policy for the president’s approval in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Google Doc is viewable <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAWatvwkdamAuSIr85HLvsj52rd-n1AYufUnba281fM/edit\">here.</a></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-65465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft Corporation’s Senior Director of Environmental Sustainability and UCSB alumna Tamara “TJ” DiCaprio discussed her role in reducing Microsoft’s carbon emissions in a talk titled ‘”Carbon Neutrality IS the Bottom Line: The Development and Success of Microsoft’s Innovative Carbon-Fee Model” Wednesday evening at Bren Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio recounted the process of convincing Microsoft executives to work toward carbon emission reduction through an internal carbon fee model, which the corporation has now used for four years. DiCaprio also discussed Microsoft’s clean energy projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the carbon fee model imposes fees on business units within Microsoft Corporation according to their carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we do, technically speaking, is we cascade the price of carbon down through the different business units and then we collect the funds in the central pot and use all those funds for environmental initiatives to reach carbon neutrality,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the internal carbon fee model is gaining recognition in business communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just recently, a couple weeks ago, recognized by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an article in the business section, which means it’s getting mainstream,” DiCaprio said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, it was difficult to gain support from Microsoft executives when first attempting to reduce the corporation’s carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody would come to my meetings,” DiCaprio said. “When they did come to my meetings, they would come and do emails the whole time. I couldn’t capture anyone’s attention, let alone get engagement in their brains.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said she was able to secure the support of executives when she learned to “speak their language” and focus on the relationship between carbon emissions and money, which lead to the creation of the internal carbon fee model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started thinking: Okay, I’m in a business, I’ve got to start talking in terms of dollars,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, Microsoft also funds carbon-offset projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not only reducing carbon in Kenya and emerging nations, but also taking money from developing countries and getting them out to the emerging nations to develop a low carbon economy,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said Microsoft’s nonprofit work is “changing peoples’ lives” by helping developing countries industrialize in a sustainable ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are able to allow them not only to plant trees, but also go build factories and sell clothes and manufacture clothing with Puma and then recycle money back to be able to build schools and hospitals for healthcare and get fresh water for people,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year environmental studies major TJ Keeling said DiCaprio’s talk showed her the potential effects of an individual’s work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It brought into prospective the impact you can have on the environment, and more of the benefits that actually show when you do work,” Keeling said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Katheryn Collins said the internal carbon fee model is surprisingly simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hear about it, it makes so much logical sense but it’s not something that I’ve seen widely done,” Collins said.</span></p>\n<p><span

School workshop Thursday evening in the Dolores Huerta Conference Room to share information on the resources available to first generation, underrepresented students pursuing graduate education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ Studies Department peer advisors Carmen Mares and Beatriz Cano geared the workshop toward students of color, providing information about the application process to obtain a master’s degree or a Ph.D. The presentations provided an overview about applying for financial aid, studying for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and making connections with faculty members to get into a desired graduate program. Current graduate students discussed potential routes to graduate school and personal circumstances which motivated them to continue their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year Chican@ studies and Black studies double major Veronica Mandujano said she was compelled to attend this workshop because she does not know anyone who has gone to graduate school prior to the workshop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to know every resource available to me,” Mandujano said. “I want to know who I can link up with, and who can offer me information when I need it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandujano said the workshop offered several resources for attendees, including information about fellowships, paying for grad school and out-of-state schooling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a great presentation and I learned a lot but mainly planning ahead, planning as much as much as you can … and the different types of grad schools that are available,” Mandujano said. “Speaking to current grad students was just kind of a more personal time to understand their experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies teaching assistant Terri Cecchine said she went through the same experiences and felt it was her responsibility to relay information about the graduate school process to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the first in my family to pursue a Ph.D., to receive a masters, so when I was approached by Carmen and Betty, of course I wanted to help out,” Cecchine said. “I have to help those that are following in the path that I have carved out for myself, it’s not easy for everyone to get here and so now that we are here, it’s really important that we network and give back, and give our wisdom.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cecchine, a low percentage of minority students acquire Ph.D.’s due to financial and social circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like it’s really hard given the obstacles that a lot of people of color are born into – the lack of resources, lack of network, lack of peer support and lack of parental support,” Cecchine said. “For whatever reason, all of those things are prominent in white communities or communities that don’t have financial stipulations, so they are obviously given a lot more access to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Carmen Mares said she held the workshop because she would like more guidance in applying to graduate school, and felt many other students were in the same position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a peer advisor here has helped me provide resources to other students, especially students that are Latino, Chicano that are first generation,” Mares said. “That’s a goal as a peer advisor to help other students like me that don’t really know what their career goals are at the moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Beatriz Cano said her main goal was to reach out to first-generation students upon becoming a peer advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[My goal is] to reach out to Chicanos, to let them know that they weren’t alone, they didn’t have to struggle,” Cano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cano said she wanted to host the workshop because she was struggling to find resources to aid her graduate school application process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pretty sure that people are interested in grad school and are struggling as bad as we are and so the purpose of this workshop is for us to help them and to help ourselves, to create this community,” Cano said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Crocker Professor at USC Gould School of Law, discussed the importance of art in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement in a lecture titled “Race, Rap, and Redemption: The Role of Art in Promoting Racial Justice” at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>During the lecture, Armour explored how art forms such as gangster rap, shed light on important issues including racial profiling, police brutality and mass incarceration. Armour has been a member of USC’s faculty since 1995 and studies several topics regarding relationships between racial justice, criminal justice and law enforcement. The lecture is part of MCC’S “Race Matters” series, which focuses on the role of racism and race in our society.</p>\n<p>Armour began the lecture by outlining racial profiling and the various social injustices it causes. According to Armour, the indignity and embarrassment of being racially profiled can be likened to “murdering an individual’s spirit.” Amour said the case of Sandra Bland, a Black woman who died in police custody in July, illustrates the damages of racial profiling.</p>\n<p>“Before Sandra Bland died, she was spirit-murdered,” Armour said. “Whoever took her life, whether it was by her hands or their hands, she had been spirit murdered to lead up to that suicide.”</p>\n<p>According to Armour, influential figures in the black community perpetuate negative attitudes toward Black men, such as Bill Cosby lecturing young black men on “pulling up their pants” and “naming their kids right.” Armour also said he employs the word “nigga” to emphasize problematic issues in the Black community.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I use that term to talk about social issues is because it gets at a mentality in the Black community that is very ugly and needs to change,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>Armour said the first time he gave the “Race, Rap, and Redemption” lecture was in USC’s Bovard auditorium to discuss the Stanley Tookie Williams case. During the event, guests used dance and music to express their opinions of the trial.</p>\n<p>“If you want to reach people at a visceral level, I find that art is the most effective way to get people to begin to empathize with people they might otherwise not find anything in common with at all,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>According to Armour, rap is a form of art that addresses racial profiling and police brutality in a way most other music does not. Amour said rap groups Public Enemy and NWA showed the perspective of Black persons in police brutality cases.</p>\n<p>“This is profound stuff in the profane. You have coarse brutal language to describe a coarse brutal reality,” Armour said. “It was a political oppositional discourse as profane as you can imagine.”</p>\n<p>According to a member of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore, one reason for the prevalence of racial insensitivity is the lack of Black history education in U.S. schools.</p>\n<p>“The more education you have the more currency you have,” Moore said. “The reason why Public Enemy was so relevant was because they educated themselves on Black history, which is not disseminated in the school system.”</p>\n<p>Moore said Black history education should be introduced to schools beginning in primary school.</p>\n<p>“This is a process that should be implemented since kindergarten, not just for Black people but for all people because then it will limit cultural insensitivity,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the “Race Matters” lecture series will continue throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>“We have great programs and I couldn’t be more thrilled with the calendar,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “This lecture [Race Rap and Redemption] was a way to kick-off the incoming year in a really critical, academic, engaging way.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously stated Charlotte A.

Last year, UCSB American Red Cross held a bake sale to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Internal vice president of UCSB American Red Cross and third-year biology major Allie Liu said she hopes UCSB will come out and support the Red Cross’s attempts to help Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to support the Syrian refugees,” Liu said. “The American Red Cross, along with UNHCR, is providing food, shelter and anything that these people who are coming from a country in chaos may need.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said students really like the bake sale and ask questions about the refugees overseas.</p>\n<p>“When we do the bake sale, we try to choose something that’s current, and we want something that a lot of people care about because it’s an occurrence that is happening on such a large scale,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>According to Halaweh, the American Red Cross is working to pair new refugees with other refugees who have been in the country for a while to provide an understanding of what it’s like to come from a war zone.</p>\n<p>“They help them assimilate, so I think that’s really cool,” Halaweh said.<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Arivanh Onevathana said she was excited to hear the Syrian Refugee Bake Sale was taking place.</p>\n<p>“We are always looking out for others and are very aware of what is currently happening in the world around us,” Onevathana said. “I was stoked to see the creative baked goods only being sold for a dollar because what better way to support by contributing to the cause than to enjoy delicious pastries at the same time? It’s a nice way for UCSB students to send aid during this time of crisis.”</p>\n<p>Halaweh said the bake sale is one of her favorite events the club hosts because fundraising is one of the three main tenants that the club adheres to in addition to volunteering and offering certification courses.</p>\n<p>“It just feels good to raise money for Syrians refugees who have been huge on the news recently,” Halaweh said. “It’s great to see the campus come out and support them.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The social offered free food and included a talk from UCSB’s new Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. The TSA will host socials, workshops, a mentoring program and other events throughout Transfer Awareness Month in November.</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Associate Dean of Students and Lecturer Don Lubach said now is the “greatest” time to be a transfer student at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with transfer students over the years, but, until the last couple of years, I haven’t seen transfer students really recognize their unique identity and get to know each faster,” Lubach said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Monica Luong said it can be difficult to establish friends as a transfer student.</p>\n<p>“Freshmen get to, like, live in dorms and they’re right next to each other, but if you’re a transfer student you might not be placed next to people your age,” Luong said, “There need to be more events just for transfer students because they feel older than everybody if they go to most social events.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Javae Valentine said housing was an issue for her when she transferred to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to find housing. I feel like it’s a common thing that UCSB fucks up your housing,” Valentine said. “They messed up my housing so I didn’t have anywhere to live at first and I was mad about that, but after that it got pretty good. I love this school.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Travis McCahon said after he transferred he also felt frustrated at UCSB for its lack of communication between departments.</p>\n<p>“This school is awful at talking to itself, like the Financial Aid to the BARC office,” McCahon said. “I almost got kicked out of school because one said I was good and the other said I wasn’t, so that’s a bit of an issue.”</p>\n<p>TSA President and fourth-year psychology major Marilyn Garcia said transfer students have a negative stigma on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you’re a third-year on paper but like a freshmen,” Garcia said, “And you have one day for orientation — that’s not enough to tell you about the different resources that we have here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said building a social network among transfer students will help alleviate challenges transfer students face.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we need to help transfer students out and we can do that, not just by having leaders like me and my exec board, but also by having a community,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, the school values its transfer students because of the experience they bring from other campuses.</p>\n<p>“You get here and you start to tell us things like ‘why does UCSB do that this way?’ instead of assuming that this is how everything should be,” Klawunn said. “That kind of perspective and that kind of insight helps us to run things better.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said transfers contribute to the campus community by taking leadership roles.<br>\n“Another thing I’ve seen is that transfer students … are really good at taking on campus leadership, so we are here to help you figure out how you want to step into that leadership,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>TSA founder and fourth-year film and media studies major December Brown said she is optimistic the transfer student experience will improve this year, largely due to the coming Transfer Student Resource Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be opening up in January and we have six new undergraduate positions, two new graduate student positions, a new transfer director and two new academic advisors to work in the centre,” Brown said. “So they’re pretty much going at it full throttle.”</p>\n<p>Brown said TSA hopes to increase the number of incoming transfer students accepted to UCSB in upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to do mentorship programs with incoming community college students during their application period,” Brown said. “We’re going to be mentoring incoming students on personal statement, helping them choose classes.”</p>\n<p>Brown said the TSA will try to provide the resources the University does not have to help increase the amount of transfer students attending UCSB every year.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re at 24 percent transfer students right now; we want to get to 33 percent as a part of Janet Napolitano’s transfer action report,” Brown said. “She wants to have 33 percent transfer students at every UC location, so we’re going to do that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Scholars are given a minimum of $120,000 to go towards tuition, room and board, loan fees, health and books. The program was created by Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Claudine Michel and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Director Michael Miller after they recognized a fundamental issue with the traditional financial aid program design.</p>\n<p>Miller said a major obstacle families with financial need face is having to commit to paying for four years of education though traditional financial aid programs only provide funding one year at a time.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of any other major purchase that works that way,” Miller said in an email. “By providing students with a four-year outlook, they are able to focus on why they are here, which is to get a world class education and entrench themselves in the UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, UCSB stands as number three on the Top Colleges Doing the Most for Low-Income Students list by The Upshot, which measures colleges’ efforts on economic diversity.</p>\n<p>“We do a great deal for low income students at UCSB,” Miller said in an email. “Approximately 75% of undergraduates at UCSB have financial aid and we disburse about $400 million annually. For most families, a UCSB education would not be possible without some sort of financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the new Promise Scholars program is offered to dedicated students from areas of California where it is less common for high school graduates to attend UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We really were not sure how the program would be received so we made a modest number of offers and we focused on areas of the state we have not been able to recruit students to UCSB in the past,” Miller said in an email. “All of the students selected for the Promise Scholar program were highly meritorious and showed a great deal of potential.”</p>\n<p>Academic Initiatives Associate Director Mark Shishim said he is confident that this group of Promise Scholars will positively impact the UCSB community in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>“This is an extraordinary group of students – I’m confident their contributions to our University will be evident in scholarship, leadership and citizenship,” Shishim said in an email. “I’m honored to be a part of their journey and proud to welcome them to the Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p>Miller said he has very high hopes for the program and wants to see the students involved on campus without worrying about finances.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see our Promise Scholars become campus leaders, work closely with faculty, participate in research and give back to the UCSB community in some way,” Miller said in an email. “By eliminating the guessing game about whether they can afford to stay at UCSB, we are hoping to see positive results in all aspects of our students’ lives.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the program could change the way financial aid is administered across the UC.</p>\n<p>“I truly believe we are on to something with multiyear financial aid awards,” Miller said in an email. “If we remain thoughtful and continue to collaborate across our campus, I think this could revolutionize the way financial aid is administered at the University of California and beyond.”</p>\n<p>Promise Scholar Advisor Natalie Gonzalez said the promise scholars benefit from various resources and opportunities to which other students do not have access.<br>\n“One of the things they are invited to is a faculty night, and that is just for them to be able to meet other faculty members on campus,” Gonzalez said. “In the Winter Quarter will be workshops on budgeting and how to renew financial aid applications, making sure that they are meeting those deadlines as well.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said she wants to introduce Promise Scholars to research opportunities and other resources.</p>\n<p>“We will have more information on how to get involved in undergraduate research, how to talk to faculty members, how to seek mentorship, and overall how to be exposed to the different resources that UCSB has to offer,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez also said she hopes the program will build a support system for the scholars that will increase retention.</p>\n<p>“I hope they have peers that they can contact and connect with in order to have that home away from home support system with each other, but also with staff, faculty and other community members that are here to support them,” Gonzalez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Associated Students Bike Committee (ASBC) and Corporal Matthew Stern from UCPD, the designated bicycle and skateboard safety officer, are largely in charge of all things bicycle related on the UCSB campus, from registration to bike path maintenance.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Stevi Ibonie said she bikes to and from class and has picked up on the bike traffic patterns in the three weeks she’s been on campus.<br>\n“I think that [bike paths] can be [crowded] at certain times of the day,” Ibonie said. “…people have a lot of 9 a.m.’s, so when you’re biking to your 9 a.m. class sometimes there’s a million people [on the paths] but then sometimes, when you’re biking back later in the day, like four or five, there’s not too many people and it’s kind of nice. So it kind of depends.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Neha Nayak said she was recently involved in a bike accident on campus.</p>\n<p>“I just got into an accident yesterday,” Nayak said. “I usually bike to campus [from Isla Vista] and then walk because I don’t like how crowded [the bike paths are]. But then I was walking, and he was going really fast, and I wasn’t looking that way, and he crashed into me, and we both got really hurt.”</p>\n<p>ASBC chair and second-year economics and accounting major Tiffany Wu said ASBC updated its Facebook page to include safety information about campus biking tips. According to Wu, inexperience with biking in crowded places and incorrect bike etiquette are the biggest causes of inefficiencies and accidents.</p>\n<p>“Biking was pretty hectic in the first few weeks when there were [first years] coming in and learning how to bike and how to navigate the bike paths,” Wu said. “Mostly, I feel like there’s not really a tradition of using hand signals at UCSB. That’s why we’re trying to navigate our committee towards a more educational path.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the biking “culture” has changed compared to when he biked on campus as a student.</p>\n<p>“Biking is what I did primarily when I came here,” Stern said. “I was also a CSO so I was on bikes pretty much 40 hours a week on campus. When I went to school here, iPods weren’t popular yet — nobody could afford them — so nobody had headphones, nobody had phones and people would actually have conversations on the bike lanes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, there is an alternative program for students who receive citations for breaking a bike-related law to attend a bike safety class for $35 instead of paying a fine upwards of $200.</p>\n<p>“When I was in school, we didn’t have the option of taking a class; we had to pay the whole fee of the citation … It wasn’t effective in terms of educating people,” Stern said. “We’re not out there to penalize students, we just want to make the environment safer for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the bicycle registration program deters theft and is bringing UCSB’s stolen bike recovery rate to 30-33 percent, which is six times the national average.</p>\n<p>“A bike that’s unregistered that is reported to a law enforcement agency statistically has about a one percent chance of recovery,” Stern said. “Bike registration is required on campus by law, and that’s primarily why it’s so effective. If I can get 100 percent compliance, I guarantee you we’d be recovering more bikes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, he is planning a new committee to reduce bike theft throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“It started off informally, and it grew into a bunch of concerned community members,” Stern said. “We’ve got people from law enforcement from the sheriff’s department and the city of Santa Barbara, along with some bicycle retailers and some county personnel.”</p>\n<p>Stern also said he is planning a campaign in March tentatively called “Dude, Where’s My Bike?” and plans to use GPS bait bikes set around campus posed as normal bikes, which law enforcement will use to apprehend perpetrators if the bikes are stolen.</p>\n<p>“The idea is it’s a full month campaign during bicycle safety month,” Stern said. “[We’ll] operate our GPS bait bikes… do a sweep of the entire campus and bicycle racks, recover as many stolen bicycles as we can and identify as many thieves [as we can].”</p>\n<p>Stern says the most important thing in bike safety is to be aware of your surroundings when biking and to follow the rules of the road.</p>\n<p>“If [bikers] make a conscious effort to pay attention to their surroundings and maybe take things a little slower than they normally would, then I think that would really reduce bike accidents,” Stern said. “It’s a misconception that bicycles always have the right of way … In Isla Vista, [in] more than 90 percent of bike [and] car accidents, the bicyclist is actually found at fault.”</p>\n<p>If you have any questions bicycle or skateboard related, email Corp.

UCSB has accommodated disabled students in the past through a bus service in the 1960s and a tram service in the 1990s, but both programs ended due to budgetary reasons.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator, C.O.D.E. liaison and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan had the idea for the project after suffering an injury that left her wheelchair-bound for six weeks.</p>\n<p>“Disabled students, both permanent and temporary, have been overlooked due to the misunderstanding that ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] compliance has solved all the issues confronting disabled persons, when in fact there is much to accomplish,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she plans to establish additional services for disabled students while in office.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes to create a Medical Equipment Loan Closet for temporarily disabled students in addition to a new Disabled Students Study Room in the library,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major David Ashalou said he fractured bones in his left knee last year and had to walk to class on crutches.</p>\n<p>“The only problem I have with this project is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Ashaolu. “It was so hard to motivate myself to get up and go to class because every walk to school felt like a marathon.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said UCSB does not have sufficient disability services.</p>\n<p>“How is a person on crutches supposed to make it from 66 or 67 DP to class at a reasonable time?” Hechler said. “Furthermore, renting equipment is really expensive and consequently leaves students with no options to get to class or around campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Hechler, A.S. is relying on funds from the parking lock-in fee to operate ATP.</p>\n<p>“It seems every time students demand services, whether it be mental health councilors, disabled person transportation or other initiatives that students demand from their institution, the University looks upon the students to fund it through lock-ins and additional student fees,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm. When deputies first made contact with Esteban Sanchez, he was being held down by three people. One deputy removed the blanket wrapped around Esteban Sanchez’s wound and revealed a cut approximately three-quarter inches in diameter around his arm. The deputy reapplied the blanket and attempted to restrain Esteban Sanchez. Medics arrived, secured Esteban Sanchez and transported him to SB Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Esteban Sanchez’s roommate said he had seen the victim earlier in the evening when he rushed into their apartment talking gibberish. One of the reporting officers visited the address, where the subject had punched through a window and cut his arm on the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted SB Cottage Hospital and provided Esteban Sanchez’s personal information.

The event, which promotes dialogue around mental health issues in hopes of combating suicide, debuted with a display at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 2008.

They planned the most recent meeting as a follow-up for those interested in joining a UCSB-based movement for stricter gun control. The group will meet again next week to discuss gun reform at the local level.</p>\n<p>Armbruster said while he believes people need time to “express their emotions” following events such as the Umpqua Community College shooting, the UCSB community needs to come together to discuss what action should be taken to advocate for stricter gun control.</p>\n<p>“I think you do need time to process, mourn and cry,” Armbruster said. “On the other hand, after you do that, there needs to be something else.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster said the pro-gun lobby has prevented gun control reform laws through “distorting” the word “freedom” and the American ideal surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“That buzzword, the discourse of just that one word, I think is so captivating, that they did a really fine job in trying to convince people that somehow, someway gun control equals lack of freedom, lack of liberty,” Armbruster said.</p>\n<p>Armbruster also said while some argue guns provide owners with protection and safety, he believes the prevalence of guns in the United States causes “insecurity.”</p>\n<p>“You never know who might be walking around here and might open up on you,” Armbruster said. “I’d rather be in a situation where I knew UCSB is gun free.”<br>\nFirst-year psychology major Jackie Rodriguez said it “frustrates” her that people in supposedly safe places, like schools, can be in danger of mass shootings.<br>\n“Like the kids from Sandy Hook, they didn’t get to have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they didn’t get to learn how to ride a bike, they didn’t get to do stuff like that,” Rodriquez said. “If I can do anything to fix that for my own children when I get older then that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology and history double major Katie Jacobson said she was pleased with the turnout at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice that other people came, it wasn’t as large as the vigil but there was people who still showed up,” Jacobson said. “It was nice to hear from people that they were also sharing the same ideas that we need to do something.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said he is glad undergraduates came to the meeting to get involved because he enjoys working with them and serving as a “resource.”</p>\n<p>“They are about as bitter and jaded as I am already, but they just care,” Irvine said. “They are so passionate and I really love being around them and I love providing my knowledge.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Willey Campbell said he attended last week’s vigil to “pay his respects” to the victims of the shooting, but the event inspired him to engage in the gun-control movement.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the impact that it had on everyone here made me want to come back and talk about how there should be more done about gun reforms,” Campbell said. “Having people that are very passionate about something like this that want to go out and make a change was something that was really motivating to me and something I wanted to be a part of especially as a first-year coming in.”</p>\n<p>The next meeting will be held this Thursday at 8 p.m. outside the SRB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
