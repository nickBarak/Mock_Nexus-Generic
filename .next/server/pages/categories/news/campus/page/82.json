Exercise and Sports Studies professor Art Gilbert and Isla Vista Food Co-op kitchen manager Madia Jamgochian will be speaking and food will be provided by the I.V. Food Co-op.</p>\n<p>According to COSWB External Coordinator Diane Byun, certain foods available to students can be deceptive in their nutritional value and can cause problems for students who do not realize that they are not getting the nourishment they need.</p>\n<p>“Our initiative is healthy eating, especially in the campus community because when you live in the dorms, you’re so enticed by the cereal and ice cream,” Byun said.  “Even if you’re an inhabitant of I.V., you aren’t surrounded by the healthiest food. Things that you think are healthy might actually be bad for you, and this event is closing in on this problem.”</p>\n<p>COSWB Chair Lisa Schwartz said the event is designed to give students multiple ways to examine the serving sizes and types of foods they consume in the hopes that they will see how important it is to maintain a balanced diet.</p>\n<p>“I hope that students will learn easy and efficient ways of eating healthy as well as the basics of what healthy eating encompasses,” Schwartz said. “We will be providing healthy sandwiches, wraps and vegetables from the I.V. Co-op to demonstrate that healthy food can be simple and delicious.”</p>\n<p>According to Byun, Gilbert’s lecture is expected to address the scientific aspects of nutrition and make students aware of the technical facets of eating a balanced diet.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of what you would see on the nutrition facts label of a cereal box, but wrapped up in a lecture with his own twist to it,” Byun said.</p>\n<p>Jamgochian said her time at UCSB provided her with personal experiences that will allow her to relate more closely with the students in attendance and demonstrate how crucial a balanced diet is to general health and well-being.</p>\n<p>“I went through a lot of the same things that the students are going through right now.  I want to offer my experience with food and the effect stress has on the food that we choose to eat,” Jamgochian said. “Some things that I will talk about are digestive illnesses and overloading sugar intake that most people do not realize.”</p>\n<p>The lecture will also address the issue of dieting and the long-term ineffectiveness of these types of eating strategies.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to listen to your body and to be healthy on an overt level without focusing on dieting for a week.  It’s more about the whole picture,” Jamgochian said. “If you try to diet for a couple of weeks, you might be successful in losing a couple of pounds, but in the long run, you’re going to gain it all back and it won’t be helpful to your body at all.”</p>\n<p>The event will begin at 7 p.m. and include a raffle for gift cards to the bookstore to encourage students to ask questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Senate was then unable to proceed with the planned discussion of next year’s budget due to the abrupt departure of four senators, which left the Senate without the requisite attendance to vote on agenda items.<br>\nThe meeting was held in the Hub rather than in the Flying A room in order to accommodate the expected audience. While the number of students present did not match the hundreds that attended the previous two meetings dealing with divestment, audience turnout was still much higher than most meetings.<br>\nThe title of the resolution was changed from “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” to “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from the Military Occupation of Palestine” in an effort to make the rhetoric more neutral.<br>\nCianni said she motioned to remove the agenda item due to the fact that the Senate had already spent two meetings discussing the issue of divestment, and the primary purpose of last night’s meeting was to solicit input from A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions groups on next year’s budget allocations.<br>\nThe dismissal of the resolution left many planned student speakers unable to address the Senate in Public Forum. Pro-divestment audience member and student sponsor of the resolution Katlen Abuata said she felt the removal of the resolution discounted the work Abuata and others had done to take criticisms into account.<br>\n“I think that Senate perpetually silences us as students,” Abuata said. “I think that since we worked hard enough to put up another resolution, we took all of the critiques and concerns that the opposition had in regards to our resolution, and we changed it. We came in here with an open mind willing to work on the resolution in any way possible, and instead they silenced us and they just completely took the resolution off the table without discussion or even thought.”<br>\nAnti-divestment audience member Jake Speyer, who had meant to speak during public forum, supported the senate’s decision.<br>\n“Coming into this meeting, there was a lot of hesitation — I think from both sides, especially since in dealing with the divestment last week, we thought … that divestment was dealt with and that we would be able to work on pro-peace initiatives for the rest of the year,” Speyer said. “I personally am satisfied with the decision of the senate … If [the resolution] was simply brought up, and we decided that our senate doesn’t want to hear it, then that’s absolutely wrong … but it was already dealt with … the revisions that were brought up were also brought up in the last meeting.”<br>\nAfter Cianni’s motion passed, University Owned Senator Miya Sommers motioned to remove On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph from the meeting, citing his failure to update his office hours on the Senate website as irresponsible. Sommers’ motion failed, at which point she and three other Senators left the meeting. Their absence left the Senate without quorum and unable to vote on other matters, such as the budget. Public Forum continued nonetheless.<br>\nA.S. President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate in Public Forum, expressing her frustration at what had occurred, especially noting what she considered a political use of the budget to undermine the divestment resolution.<br>\n“You all have literally two weeks to look at this budget and I am very frustrated by you using it politically,” Armen said. “This is the entire Association’s futurec … and now what I’m now actually afraid of, is if the possibility that something else could happen next week, we won’t be able to have the discussion that we could have had this week.”<br>\nAssociate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said senators need to treat each other with kindness and respect.<br>\n“If there is one thing that truly, truly pains me … is to have to watch young people like yourselves be really so mean and so cruel to one each other,” Jones said. “This level of cruelty knows no party lines, no political lines, no religious affiliation, no cultural, ethnic or gender orientation, or any other form of categorization. It is universal, it is coming from all sides, it is multidirectional. And it is truly heartbreaking to watch when you don’t have to do that. You don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Senators were unable to officially adjourn due to the lack of quorum. Discussion on the budget will continue next week.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/","id":3076,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3075,3074,3073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Abboud Named A.S.

Fees Reaffirmed</em></h2>\n<p>[[UPDATED]]</p>\n<p>Emotions were high Thursday night as Associated Students election and fee results were announced in the Hub, with the Open People’s Party sweeping every executive position and all but one senatorial seat and revealing two new initiatives — such as The Bottom Line’s lock-in fee — to have passed.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Kyley Scarlet, Alex Moore and Alex Choate — all members of O.P.P. — will be fulfilling the roles of A.S. president, Internal Vice President, External Vice President of Local Affairs and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, respectively. Kristian “With a K” Whittaker, an independent candidate, will be holding the office of Student Attorney General and all senators, with the exception of the uncontested seat of university owned off-campus senator, will be representatives of O.P.P. In regards to new fee initiatives, the fee for the Commission on Student Well-Being and the campus publication The Bottom Line passed.</p>\n<p>Megan Foronda, former presidential candidate of the DP party, said the lack of success that befell her party this year took a toll on party members, but will also serve as motivation for the group for years to come.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of heart, a lot of passion, a lot of time and energy that was invested into this campaign … we saw this campaign as more than just the campaign,” Foronda said. “I may not be expressing it right now, but I think it’s fair to say that we’re all very angry, emotional and disappointed.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, O.P.P.’s success this year can be attributed primarily to the extensive planning, organizing and funding that went into preparing for this year’s campaign season.</p>\n<p>“We were very organized. Everything was planned out way in advance, so there was no confusion anytime in the election,” Abboud said. “Everyone knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing — that was biggest thing. We had amazing campaign managers who did this all for us.”</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Christianson, this year’s EVPLA candidate from DP, said she was disappointed in the election results, not only for herself, but for the student body.</p>\n<p>“There’re a lot of good candidates on both sides. I believe in our senators and last year’s O.P.P. senators, but this year, when I would go to a campaign, to a forum, to an event, I couldn’t go without seeing DP members putting in work,” Christianson said. “I couldn’t go to any event without seeing DP members there doing hard work.”</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, the incumbent A.S. President, said this election was a reaffirmation of her belief that the party system at UCSB is not the most productive method for representing students in a unified and effective manner.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s the best system, and that’s been seen in my policy and I’ve reflected that,” Armen said. “But I’m not the only one in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>The recent controversy over the A.S. Senate’s decision to not divest from companies supportive of the Israeli government was a small factor in this year’s elections, according to O.P.P. Chair Sawyeh Maghsoodloo. However, Maghsoodloo said O.P.P. never took a stance on the issue of divestment, and the party never purposefully sought the support of groups for or against divesting from companies who gain from the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“I think that divestment did play a role in the election results. It wasn’t, by any means, us initiating support from that community. It was completely voluntary, and we didn’t even organize with that group,” Maghsoodloo said. “They were all kind of on their own, rallying for O.P.P. on their own initiative.”</p>\n<p>With help from family, friends and the popular fundraising website gofundme.com, O.P.P. had a solid monetary support system to ensure the party was prepared for any obstacle, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>“All the execs asked for family contributions, and all the senators paid $150 each,” Abboud said. “We all pooled our money together, and more than half was fundraising from family and friends back home.”</p>\n<p>O.P.P. spent a total of $5,977.51 on their campaign, closely approaching the $6,000 limit imposed on parties for the election process. While the DP Party has not yet finalized their total budget, Christianson estimated the campaign costs accumulated to approximately $5,350.</p>\n<p>Annalise Domenighini, executive managing editor of <em>The Bottom Line</em>, said the students’ willingness to support the new quarterly lock-in fee of $1.69 not only affirms the importance of print media but provides an opportunity to students looking to expand their journalistic capabilities.</p>\n<p>“At <em>TBL</em>, we really like to pride ourselves on being a training organization, in addition to being a news organization. You are still allowed to join even if you don’t necessarily have any experience; we want to give it to you,” Domenighini said. “I’m really happy to see that students are still looking to print media, especially since print media is ‘dying’ and I’m very excited for the future of <em>TBL</em>.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"702901002\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51076\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51070\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/alumni-to-bring-local-flavor-to-all-gaucho-reunion/vandenbelt5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Vandenbelt5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51070\" alt=\"Vandenbelt5\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VENDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Newly elected A.S.

The ongoing elections process, along with some recently contentious meetings, have contributed to increasingly negative feelings between senators and led speakers to address events and actions that bothered them within the Senate.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph read a letter during the public forum condemning the actions of another unnamed senator, citing tweets in which the senator allegedly spoke disrespectfully toward colleagues and accused the senator of missing last week’s meeting for campaigning reasons.</p>\n<p>“Senators attacking other senators and posting public statements during the Senate meetings that both undermine and attack the process … should be deemed as unacceptable behavior for an elected official of the student body,” Rudolph said. “I ask if this behavior not changed, that the Internal Vice President puts the Senator’s removal on the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson addressed the public forum as well, and said such accusations reflected party politics and should be let go.</p>\n<p>“I just feel like we focus on petty stuff so much … and I really hope that we can just move on,” Christianson said. “This is obviously about parties and it happens on both sides, and it’s really stupid.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia also spoke during the public forum and aimed to clear up some accusations that have been made toward executive officers, asking that the senators respect the effort that she puts into her job.</p>\n<p>“Accusations [including] how execs have been spending their money or that the association is corrupt, I personally … hate it, actually, when people are making allegations like that … because I feel like it is undermining the work of the people that have actually been doing really great things,” Segovia said. “I just hold myself to a higher standard, and I hope you all hold me to that standard, too. I hope I’m not failing you.”</p>\n<p>After the tense public forum was over, the senators passed a resolution supporting A.S. President Sophia Armen’s invitation to the UC Regents to hold a regent meeting on the UCSB campus, as well as a resolution to divest from companies that profit from the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>Though there was some confusion around a statistic that one senator argued was misleading in the prison divestment resolution, the senators ultimately passed the resolution unanimously.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Miya Sommers, who contributed to the resolution, said the prison industrial complex contributes to institutional racism within our society.</p>\n<p>“This is just really important because, again, the prison industrial complex is very disastrous for the functioning of our society,” Sommers said. “People of color are over-incarcerated … and this is, sort of, a new form of racial prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor third-year Middle Eastern studies major Hani Tajsar said the incarceration statistics themselves show the unjust incrimination of people of color.</p>\n<p>“White people are three times more likely to have drugs on them, or to be using illegal drugs … but people of color, specifically black people, are four times more likely to be searched on suspicion of having drugs,” Tajsar said. “I think the statistics speak for themselves.”</p>\n<p>During next week’s meeting, the senators will consider the Finance Board budget for the 2013-14 school year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876185273\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51071\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51069\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/alumni-to-bring-local-flavor-to-all-gaucho-reunion/as_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51069\" alt=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt-250x166.jpeg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s public forum, A.S.

Gov. Jerry Brown, UC President Mark Yudof, Board Chair Sherri Lansing and the rest of the Regents were asked by Armen to respond to her by 5 p.m. today.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, there needs to be increased and more open communication between UC regents and students, as past student involvement in the addressing the University’s financial woes has resulted in real change.</p>\n<p>“Especially after the passage of Proposition 30, which can largely be attributed to students getting out the youth vote, for us, as students, to be continually shut out of the decision-­making process is unacceptable,” Armen said in an email. “We are at a historic moment for public higher education in California — for the first time in history students are paying more for their education than their State is…”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Nadim Houssain said demands for a UC Regents meeting on campus would allow students to directly voice their concerns regarding the current state affordability of higher education.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t try to reach out to them, we have no excuse to be frustrated,” Houssain said. “Students will have more access to Regents during the meeting itself … more opportunities to speak during public forum before meetings.”</p>\n<p>While the Regents have been hesitant to transfer their meetings to other locations in the past, Houssain said a UC Regents meeting at UCSB is a “relatively feasible” goal, although there may still be some concern over student protests occurring.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 23rd, 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Student Advocate General assists students who are charged with violating the University Code of Student Conduct, and students charged of such misconduct are expected to undergo.</p>\n<p>When asked their opinion on the new Conduct Board that aims to judge and potentially punish student groups, both candidates said students should have active involvement in this legal process.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villela said he would make sure to keep a constant presence at the Conduct Board meetings, despite some logistical obstacles to this goal.</p>\n<p>“As far as Conduct Boards, I feel that it is still my space to go and represent these students, so no matter what, I’m still going to be there,” Villela said. “Even though I’m not allowed to say anything, I’m still allowed to ask for time-outs.”</p>\n<p>Whittaker argued that the idea of a conduct board was unfair to students, and said he would fight to gain a greater student voice in this matter.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it’s personally attacking the students on an underhanded level,” Whittaker said. “I have found that most student conduct cases are mistakes — mistakes that most students overlook or just simply forgot … I feel like the Student Advocate General needs a push for an actual say — to actually represent the students in these cases with an actual voice.”</p>\n<p>In regards to past student advocacy efforts, Whittaker said his time on the A.S. Senate and his involvement in creating a group project seeking student input are two experiences that directly qualify him for the position. Whittaker said he plans to change the usual procedures for the position, making a greater effort to assist student defendants.</p>\n<p>“Myself and the four other on-campus legislative council members have definitely felt that our constituents … were not directly represented. However, it was our fault … we were not going to these residence halls as we should have been,” Whittaker said. “Thus we created our group project … we did not wait for them to come to us — we went to them.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Villela mentioned his role in starting Educational Opportunity Program Step Up[[ok]], which raised over $20,000 for the Educational Opportunity Program. Introducing the new program required a sense of initiative that Villela said he would bring to the role of Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>“EOP, as many of you know, are for first-generation students … EOP got hit hard, just as a lot of things on this campus got hit hard, and what happened was — I was a part of a two-week program, and what they were going to do was to cut it down to five days,” Villela said. “So what I did, during my first year along with 10 other people, was to create this program called Step Up.”</p>\n<p>Since the Student Advocate General must regularly resolve student conflicts on a large scale, candidates were also questioned on their ability to come to an effective and fair decision.</p>\n<p>Villela said his time as a Resident Assistant has given him first-hand experience in dealing with a variety of personal conflicts between students, and Villela said he plans to provide students undergoing the university judicial process with a “safe, confidential space.”</p>\n<p>“As a Resident Assistant, I deal with conflicts all the time. We had a very conservative [student], and then we had a student that was a part of the LGBT community, and then a student that was not supportive of that…it was a space for me…to figure out how to best work with each other,” Villela said.</p>\n<p>Whittaker, on the other hand, cited a personal experience when he had had to deal with his own roommate’s misconceptions about his queer identity.</p>\n<p>“In mid-winter, I got a new roommate and I hadn’t met this person before, so they came in and I guess the roommate didn’t know that I was a queer person … I guess that he didn’t feel too comfortable with me and my sexuality,” Whittaker said. “To be honest, a lot of his complications with me were misconceptions about the queer community … so it definitely just came through education, definitely letting him know a lot of the things he believed about queer people were false.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they would maintain truthfulness and accountability within the Office of the Student Advocate General, Villela said that he would be sure to remain nonpartisan and create a Facebook page for the office to reach out to students. Whittaker said he would create an ‘advocacy agenda’ by the fifth week of Fall 2013, which would expand analytical research in the office.</p>\n<p>In their final statements, both candidates stressed their commitment to the student body. Whittaker said he wants to push for more clarified definitions of policies for students, whereas Villela said he would ensure that the Office of Student Advocacy is a safe place for any student who needs it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1822965026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50949\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50952\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/candidates-discuss-student-conduct-compete-for-advocate-general-position/as-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366215104\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"117\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50952\" alt=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>ALEX GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> Student Advocate General candidates debated issues related to judicial affairs on campus yesterday.

Additionally, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco announced his resignation, citing career-related commitments.</p>\n<p>In contrast to last week’s heavily attended and contentious meeting, Wednesday’s meeting saw a much smaller turnout and a significantly shorter list of speakers at Public Forum. Several Senators were absent, and opted to send proxies instead.</p>\n<p>The first speakers in public forum — Mark Hartell and Rebecca Metzger of the UCSB Library staff — informed the Senate on the status of upcoming renovations to Davidson Library that are currently scheduled to last two and a half years. Hartell said the changes have been delayed for too long, and are just barely coming to life after decades of planning.</p>\n<p>“In terms of construction, nothing has happened in 35 years … It’s been many, many years in the planning, but it really is going to start,” Hartell said. “In a nutshell, the project is scheduled to run for two and a half years.”</p>\n<p>Swipes For The Homeless representatives Ali Guthy and Shannon Mirshokri also spoke during Public Forum, requesting the Senate’s support in expanding their program. Swipes For The Homeless is a program in which students can donate their unused dining commons meals to a local homeless shelter.</p>\n<p>“This is a really amazing program, and we really hope that you all will support our endeavor,” Guthy said. “This has to occur in a dialogue with administration, which currently we’re having trouble starting … we just really need more support.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja shared her thoughts on the Senate’s decision to refrain from passing last week’s divestment resolution. Ahuja said the Senate did not adequately listen to her and other individuals’ arguments in support of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I am disgusted by this space because not only did you let bureaucratic and political crap get in the way of passing this resolution, but you also didn’t take into account the fact that over 30 organizations on this campus sponsored this resolution,” Ahuja said. “I think you need to take a look at yourself as Senate and look at the people around you … people should be aware of the privileges they do have.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez presented a seminar regarding a potential project aimed at teaching students important financial life skills. Additionally, Katlen Abu Ata asked senators to be aware of the unjust American prison system especially in light of a recent gang injunction proposed by the Santa Barbara County Chief of Police.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of Public Forum, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco officially announced his resignation from the post, in the most recent of a string of Senate resignations this year. Orozco said the decision came after considering his priorities in the near future.</p>\n<p>“I have a lot of things to worry about coming up in the next couple of weeks,” Orozco said. “It has to do with career.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Senators passed a bill changing the recruitment period of Associated Students as well as resolutions supporting Swipes for the Homeless and Martinez’s finance seminar.</p>\n<p>Senators tabled a resolution entitled “Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit form the Prison Industrial Complex” for one week, at the request of resolution author Navkiran Kaur, who was not present at the meeting. They also created ad hoc committees to deal with certain issues facing the Isla Vista community, namely the sobering center and unsafe balconies.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Kyley Scarlet proposed an ad hoc committee to look into possible solutions for the balcony problem in order to prevent future incidents similar to the balcony that fell Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“For those of you who don’t know, 6643 [Del Playa] — their balcony collapsed,” Scarlet said. “When things like this happen, the liability falls completely on the people who live there … [The ad hoc will be] kind of figuring out what we can do about that.”</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s meeting adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Next week, A.S. Senators will address the prison divestment resolution in addition to other issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1144913256\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50959\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50960\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-s-senates-meeting-discusses-library-renovations-nonprofits-divestment-resolution/for-04-18-2013_senate_file-photo-4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366225829\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50960\" alt=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>Senators at the A.S.Senate meeting last Wednesday considered the status of the Davidson Library renovation project, among other topics.

Commission on Student Well-Being, an organization dedicating to promoting healthy practices among UCSB students through various events and services.</p>\n<p>The measure constitutes one of two new A.S. fee initiatives on the ballot this year along with a proposal for a lock-in fee supporting the A.S. weekly newspaper, <i>The Bottom Line</i>. Of the total $1.03 fee, $.71 will go towards the organization, while the remainder will be put towards financial aid and covering administrative fees.</p>\n<p>Lisa Schwartz, a COWSB spokesperson and a current Peer Pre-Health Advisor at the Academic Advising Office, said the goal of the initiative is to gain funding for events that would enrich the physical and mental health of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“The Associated Students Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) is committed to the general wellbeing of UCSB undergraduates, with a particular emphasis on mental wellbeing,” Schwartz said. “Its purpose is to increase awareness, educate, and advocate for students. COSWB also creates many programs that provide a positive and comfortable environment for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>COSWB currently holds weekly free fitness class at the UCEN and in Isla Vista, including yoga, Krav Maga, kickboxing and hip-hop dancing. In addition, COSWB hosts events that educate students on healthy eating habits, mental health issues and other health-related topics, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>“A few weeks ago we had a bounce house. It was amazing to watch the difference in people’s demeanor as they left feeling rejuvenated and refreshed,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Should the fee initiative pass, COSWB’s plan is to expand on the services they already provide for students, according to fourth-year biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>“We plan to lead off campus trips that will be available at no additional charge for students,” Schwartz said. “These events include whale watching, day trips and camping at the Channel Islands, game trucks and additional fitness classes both in IV and on campus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3070,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3069,3068,3067],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"TBL Continues Campaign for Student Lock-In Fee","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tbl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tbl.jpg?resize=474%2C419&ssl=1","description":"Next week’s Associated Students elections ballot will include a proposal for a $1.69 per quarter student lock-in fee in support of The Bottom Line, A.S.’s weekly campus newspaper.

If passed, the money would go toward providing new equipment, more content and covering of travel costs. The fee, which is one of two new A.S. lock-in fees being voted on this election, would go into effect next fall and be subject to reaffirmation every two years.</p>\n<p>Domenighini said the lock-in fee might also allow for more compensation for writers and editors to offset recent pay cuts.</p>\n<p>“One of our biggest setbacks is that we had to considerably reduce the amount of money that staff members are being paid,” Domenighini said. “So every staff member saw their paychecks go down very considerably. Editors had … the amount of money that they’re making reduced by over half.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, TBL was allocated $12,000 from A.S. for honoraria earlier this year, and covers a large portion of its printing costs through grants the staff applied for. However, Martinez said some of these grants may not be available next year, and the paper needs a more stable source of funding in order to continue to cover costs.</p>\n<p>Though the fee initiative failed to pass last year, Domenighini and Executive Content Editor Kelsey Gripenstraw said they remain confident it will pass this year, considering it fell short of the necessary 50 percent majority of 7,100 voters by only a couple hundred votes.</p>\n<p>“Our promotional campaign … wasn’t as strong as previous years,” Domenighini said. “Last year we really ramped that up, so I think the number one factor that we were facing last year was just that people didn’t really know who we were, so they were probably voting for a lock-in fee [when] they didn’t really know, exactly, what the publication was going through.”</p>\n<p>According to Gripenstraw, TBL’s weekly publication is not likely to change regardless of whether or not the initiative passes, but they may be forced to work with less if the measure fails. However, she said having more than one campus news source is important for the university and their readership.</p>\n<p>“We value having multiple media sources on campus, because think about how the United States would be if there was one source of media. It would be insane,” Gripenstraw said. “Like, you can’t just rely on one news source for the entire school, especially with a school as huge as UCSB. So we’re here just to provide another voice.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of the April 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3080,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[3079,3078,3077],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Off-Campus Senator Alex Choate represented the Open People’s Party (OPP). The forum centered on issues ranging from how the future EVPSA would reach out to the UC Board of Regents to addressing the needs of undocumented students studying within the UC.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the UC Office of the President tax that was introduced last year, which requires all UC campuses to pay a 1.69 percent fee on all revenue-earning funding streams — including student-funded campus groups — Orozco said she was at the UCSA Congress when the UCOP initially introduced the fee.</p>\n<p>According to Orozco, the UCOP tax is an unjust financial strain on students, and as such, she said she will protest it by pressuring Chancellor Henry Yang to compile legislation in opposition to it.</p>\n<p>“I was there with the current UCSB President Sophia Armen when they were speaking to us about initiating the tax, and I was very vocally against it,” Orozco said. “After that, I was part of a group that organized rallies against it and put together an education campaign …[Student fees are] something we’ve decided to vote on and tax ourselves on. I will continue to actively voice against it.”</p>\n<p>However, Choate said the A.S. Senate has already passed a resolution calling for Chancellor Yang to stop the tax.</p>\n<p>“I sit on the student Senate, and we actually passed a resolution urging Chancellor Yang not to [tax],” Choate said. “And currently, as of right now, he has approved to not tax students once again this year…However, we have to work and look forward to next year and our future generations of students.”</p>\n<p>Following the EVPSA elections forum, the three candidates for the next A.S. President took the stage to debate issues ranging from topics of special projects on campus to broader subjects, like the interpretation of the top A.S. executive’s responsibilities.</p>\n<p>RHA President Jonathan Abboud debated as the OPP candidate, while Residential Advisor Megan Foronda spoke as the DP candidate and Patrick “Mac” Kennedy represented himself as an independent, non-partisan candidate.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, the role of the A.S. president is to be an advocate of the students and to effectively communicate with UCSB administration. Abboud said he has three focal points that tackle all issues relevant to the A.S. presidency — University affairs, campus culture and the role of fiscally responsible management of A.S. funds.</p>\n<p>“First, strengthening higher education in California, we must unite together. Students, workers, faculty, staff and alumni must be united in our defense of higher education in California because students alone cannot win this fight,” Abboud said. “Second, campus culture is important to me. I think UCSB has a lacking campus culture, and A.S. should be instrumental in building new campus traditions…My last focal point is fiscal responsibility. You pay $180 every quarter into A.S. and you deserve to see every single dollar of that money. I want to take the leftover money and refund it back to you at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>If elected as A.S. President, Foronda said she would work with both university administration as well as students, and said she plans to focus primarily on issues such as protesting UC tuition increases and assuring there is fair representation of all communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to priorities, you must prioritize students first, especially in terms of higher education. When it comes to tuition hikes, students are out there advocating for themselves. I want to ensure that funding continues to go to student organizations that do work on this campus,” Foronda said. “When it comes to empowerment, I want to ensure that students themselves feel empowered in every space they are in. When we talk about campus climate, I want to make sure that marginalized communities feel safe on this campus and make sure that their voices are represented in these larger institutions.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he sees the role of A.S. President as someone who would unite the student body and reach out to students who are not members of A.S. Essentially, Kennedy said he is running on three main points — reducing tuition, ending A.S. corruption and improving campus climate.</p>\n<p>“I would make sure to reduce tuition. I’m the only candidate that has experience lobbying in Sacramento and that has developed relationships with key legislators,” Kennedy said. “I want to reform corruption in A.S. Currently, the five executives are using your student fees to pay for their own tuition — that’s corruption. That’s $4,500 and I’ll make sure that goes back to you.

Kennedy, a second-year political science major, who served as an On-campus Senator until his resignation in January, is an independent candidate.</p>\n<p>Foronda said she aims to use her student body government experience to engage and empower students if elected.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved with Associated Students since my first year,” Foronda said. “I am here today not only to run as AS president, but to represent you as a student body and the student voices that have otherwise been silenced.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he would continue to make real changes on campus as A.S. President in addition to the reforms he has already implemented as RHA President.</p>\n<p>“I love UCSB. Since the first day I stepped on this campus I fell in love with this campus,” Abboud said. “I have implemented real changes on this campus … [like] take out boxes in the dining commons. The Office of the President will allow me to implement even more direct change to this campus”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said substantive reform is necessary to make the association more fiscally efficiently and criticized A.S.’s excessive spending of student’s money on honoraria — particularly on salaries for Executive candidates.</p>\n<p>“I’m running because I’m passionate about making this campus a better place for all students,” Kennedy said. “There needs to be several structural reforms in A.S. Currently, tens of thousands of dollars aren’t going back to the students, and are being pocketed by A.S. executives.”</p>\n<p>Foronda focused on the rising cost of tuition as the chief monetary concern for students, and said it is crucial to encourage students to participate in rallies, lobby legislators and generally voice concerns about the issue.</p>\n<p>“Tuition has risen over 300 percent in the last 10 years,” Foronda said. “Student voices have not been heard … I will be there, and I have been there … representing student voices.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, his goal is to continue keeping students constantly involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get caught up in the jargon,” Abboud said. “As RHA president, and as A.S. senator … I’ve done a really good job connecting with students. A.S. was created for and by the students and we have the right to keep A.S. … related to the students.”</p>\n<p>Addressing the subject of student apathy, Kennedy said the fault lies not with the general student population, but with their student government representatives who have failed to successfully engage them.</p>\n<p>“Disconnect is a huge problem between A.S. and the student body,” Kennedy said. “Students have not been engaged at all whatsoever in A.S. …where is the outreach? Where is the engagement? … I hope that in the future as I have done to continue the work in engaging students … making sure students are aware that they have agency, that they have power.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1172887416\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50825\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50819\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/debate_filephoto/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPod touch\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365682595\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"3.3\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50819\" alt=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>On Wednesday night, A.S.

Several attendees spoke both in opposition and in support of the resolution, which requested that A.S. divest from companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, that “profit” from the “military occupation of Palestine.” The meeting also included resolutions aiming to condemn “Islamophobic hate speech” on campus.</p>\n<p>In regards to the resolution entitled “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid,” 11 senators voted against the resolution and 10 senators voted in support of it, while one senator abstained. The resolution, therefore, did not achieve the required two-thirds majority, and was not passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:55 a.m., after over 13 hours of deliberation.</p>\n<p>The aisle dividing the chairs into two seating sections at Corwin Pavilion marked a clear boundary between each side of the debate, with pro-divestment advocates on the left and anti-divestment advocates on the right. Participants demonstrated incredible passion throughout the entire meeting, as evidenced by the multiple instances of tense voices and tears.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders preceded the debate with an appeal to the audience to remain respectful of the different perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can … realize that there are passions on both sides of, in particular, the divestment issue — pro and con — and to address people in that way,” Sanders said. “Know that you’re not the only one that has passion about this. You’re not the only one that has an interest in this subject. In fact, there is another side to it, and to please see things from that side, and to address people in a mature way.”</p>\n<p>The meeting first began at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, marking the second meeting that included discussion of the divestment resolution. As the issue had already been discussed in much depth at last week’s meeting, speakers had the opportunity to reflect upon last week’s discussion and respond to some of the previous arguments. Adeel Lakhani, External Co-Chair at UCSB Academic Affairs Board, urged senators to be critical of the information being presented, such as when some speakers said Israel was not the only country in the region violating human rights.</p>\n<p>This second meeting also attracted many community members from outside of UCSB. The Santa Barbara chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace presented multiple speakers who, although personally identifying as Jewish, supported the divestment resolution. Rand Clark of Jewish Voice for Peace said being of the Jewish faith does not necessarily mean one is supportive of the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“To be Jewish does not automatically make one a blind supporter of Israel — right or wrong,” Clark said. “A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude towards Jews … A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speakers, however, vehemently denied that the divestment resolution would be a step toward justice. UCSB student Jonathan Lebo insisted the legislation would not encourage a peaceful solution.</p>\n<p>“The bill before you tonight is not about fostering peace,” Lebo said. “It will do nothing to end the centuries-old conflict between Jews and their Arab neighbors. The real [impact] of this bill is to deny the people of Israel the right to their homeland … The charges against Israel make no mention of the dire circumstances Israel faces.”</p>\n<p>Many anti-divestment speakers also questioned if Israel is actually breaking international law or committing human rights violations, as the resolution suggests.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, speakers representing both sides of the issue spoke about the effects the resolution would have on campus climate. Some anti-divestment speakers argued the divestment resolution was divisive and would hurt the general climate of UCSB, while some pro-divestment speakers argued it would actually unify the campus, as shown by the numerous student groups in support of its passage.</p>\n<p>Sabreen Shalabi of UC Irvine, who authored a similar resolution that passed unanimously at UCI, not only insisted campus climate at her school had not changed after passing the resolution, but also said past issues of similar importance have always faced such strong resistance.</p>\n<p>“The passing of the divestment resolution did not cause our campus to deteriorate in any way,” Shalabi said. “No issue is going to be agreed upon unanimously. No issue has ever been agreed upon unanimously … senators here today, sitting around, having this power to vote, this privilege to vote. Would you have voted for civil rights? Would you have voted to divest in Apartheid South Africa? That is the kind of decision that you are making today.”</p>\n<p>Despite such claims, many Jewish students said they felt campus climate had already changed. UCSB student Nathan Koreie felt so strongly about the degradation of the campus climate that he announced his official withdrawal from the university.</p>\n<p>“I was intimidated while in the A.S. Senate office. A student was spit on while on her way to class. Someone let the air out of my bike tires while at the A.S. Senate office, and a friend of mine was even denied service at the book store, all for opposing this resolution,” Koreie said. “As of this morning … I withdrew from UCSB … I genuinely feel like I have been left with no other choice.”</p>\n<p>First-hand accounts of life in Israel contradicted each other over whether or not Israel did engage in apartheid practices. Mohamed Hafez, a UCSB alumnus who spent time working for peace in the West Bank, insisted that citizens had different rights based on race. On the other hand, UCSB student Guy Singer, who lived in Israel for 11 years, insisted that Arab Israelis were not discriminated against, as there are Arab Israelis in positions of power and even Arab Israelis who are celebrities.</p>\n<p>Both parties called into question the reliability of sources being used for factual evidence, asserting bias within the sources. The integrity of many institutions was debated — including the United Nations, Amnesty International, the American government and others.</p>\n<p>At one point, the use of Miss Israel 2013’s African heritage to show Israel’s commitment to diversity elicited intensely critical responses. On-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur strongly opposed this example, explaining it to be offensive and an objectification of women of color.</p>\n<p>“I do not appreciate a woman of color’s body being objectified, or hyper-sexualized or tokenized in this space,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>In some final presentations regarding the resolution, both sides issued their opinions on the word apartheid itself. Anti-divestment representative Liran Braude, who has both lived in South Africa during apartheid and then in Israel as a soldier, disagreed with the word’s place in the legislation.</p>\n<p>“To compare [South Africa and Israel] is an insult of the highest order — not only to Jews and Israelis, but mostly to the black South Africans that actually suffered of apartheid,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>Hani Tajsar, student sponsor and representative of the pro-divestment stance, denied that naming Israel an apartheid state equated it to South Africa.</p>\n<p>“Apartheid does not mean that Israel is acting in the same way as South Africa,” Tajsar said. “South Africa and Israel have only one similarity: both were born out of imperialism and colonialism … As students at this university, we have a complicit involvement in the occupation of Palestine through our investments in these companies.”</p>\n<p>Katlen Abuata, Tajsar’s co-sponsor, added her own personal appeal to argument for divestment.</p>\n<p>“I do not want to pay into a system that has removed my father from his homeland,” Abuata said.</p>\n<p>Deliberation within the senate revisited many of the arguments that had already been introduced. Senators read different definitions of apartheid and debated whether or not voting on the bill was an act of neutrality and whether or not it would have tangible results in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The student legislators also discussed the role of the investments in enabling human rights violations, and whether or not it was acceptable for student money to be funneled toward that cause. There was also debate over the intentions of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and its connection with the resolution. After the deliberation, which included a long discussion on whether the resolution needed a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, the senators decided to cast a secret vote, which resulted in a defeat of the proposed resolution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"543296520\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50820\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/divestment_tiana/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone 4S\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365666521\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.05\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Divestment_Tiana\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50817\" alt=\"Divestment_Tiana\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>TIANA MILLER-LEONARD / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

The IVP is the head of the A.S. Senate, the university’s student law-making body which holds weekly meetings that include distributing A.S. funds and other governmental affairs.</p>\n<p>Later in the afternoon, the debates for the position of EVPLA — which deals with issues primarily related to I.V. — took place. Candidates debated issues such as community-building, legal representation for I.V. residents and better safety efforts for large local events like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>For the IVP debate, there was discussion of controversial A.S. topics like partisan lines that have sometimes existed in the Senate in past years, and the increasing number of senators resigning from the organization.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate and current A.S. senator Kyley Scarlet said fostering an inclusive environment requires that the A.S. Senate not become divided on party lines.</p>\n<p>“After we get elected in the spring, we are not from different parties … We are all on the same team, and therefore making the senators realize that we all ran together to make a change — to do something different on this campus — is essential,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the marginalized communities in Isla Vista and on campus, independent candidate for the IVP seat, Martin Polanco, said his personal experience as a potentially marginalized individual has not prevented him from integrating himself into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“Considering myself — as Latino, Hispanic or Mexican — I could be part of a marginalized community, but I feel that I’m not,” Polanco said. “I’m in a community, and I’m going to reach out to these other communities to find equal common ground so we can act together and make a difference.”</p>\n<p>As for reaching out to the general student body, Juan Galvan — Democratic Process Party candidate and current A.S. senator — said the association must be proactive in their recruitment efforts and attempts to make themselves more accessible to other students.</p>\n<p>“As IVP, as the leader of the association, I see it more as a facilitator,” Galvan said. “You have to really facilitate and work within, internally first, to create these coalitions among the different [Boards, Commissions and Committees] and create projects together — in order to be more open to the outside.”</p>\n<p>The two candidates vying for the spot of External Vice President of Local Affairs, Kaitlyn Christianson of the DP party and OPP’s Alexander Moore, spoke on a myriad of issues — such as keeping Isla Vista a tight-knit community and pushing for increased safety measures that would protect all residents.</p>\n<p>With last week’s Deltopia still fresh in the minds of students, candidates were asked how they would handle the growing issue of safety and crime in the community.</p>\n<p>Moore, who has worked in Isla Vista as a medical first responder during Halloween, said it is necessary to make law enforcement more accessible to students while also providing bystander intervention training to the community.</p>\n<p>Given the 23,000 residents living in I.V. and mere eight to 12 police officers patrolling the area, Christianson said it is necessary for the EVPLA and other campus entities — such as CSO officers — to better contribute to legal patrolling in I.V. Like Moore, Christianson also expressed the need to encourage bystander intervention in emergency situations.</p>\n<p>Since large-scale I.V. events are here to stay, the EVPLA Office must make efforts to educate the next generation of I.V. residents, Christianson said.</p>\n<p>“You have thousands of freshmen that are going to participate in these events, and their first glance is I.V. on a Friday night,” Christianson said. “I think the EVPLA office needs to go into the dorms and talk to them about these issues, representing I.V. in a positive light.”</p>\n<p>However, Moore’s solution to handling I.V.’s biggest parties is to reduce the amount of out-of-towners and to educate non-local police forces, who are oftentimes transferred into I.V. for these events, on students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure that out of town law enforcement that gets brought in to control these events is sensitive to students’ needs … A lot of times, LAPD and UCPD from other schools aren’t as sensitive to student needs and student rights as they should be. One of the things I really want to do is to make sure that those folks undergo training.”</p>\n<p>The debate also touched on better representing I.V. at the county level and keeping the community inclusive of all residents.</p>\n<p>According to Moore, I.V. has gone through a series of development projects — such as new residential buildings like The Loop — resulting in costly living conditions for students.</p>\n<p>“Those buildings can cost more than $1,000 per bed. I can’t afford those; I know our local community members can’t afford those, and neither can our permanent residents,” Moore said. “Gentrification is a problem in Isla Vista, and we need to manage it by re-evaluating the Isla Vista Master Plan … I really hope not to necessarily combat development, but to really improve on the plans set.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Christianson said the development of I.V. has taken advantage of student residents and local families alike.</p>\n<p>“Most of us have to live in I.V. — it’s close to campus, easy, accessible and we love I.V … Landlords know this and so they take advantage of these students and raise prices,” Christianson said. “There was an eviction of these families on Embarcadero del Mar this year, where they essentially told the families to get out because they were going to remodel and the families didn’t know they were being kicked out so they can raise prices.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/","id":3091,"author":{"id":200,"name":"Arda Jooharian"},"related":[3090,3089,3088],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Resolution Conversation Continues To Dominate Senate Meetings","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-Divestment-JohnClow-04.10.2013-06.jpg?resize=355%2C226&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-Divestment-JohnClow-04.10.2013-06.jpg?resize=400%2C226&ssl=1","description":"Last night’s Associated Students Senate meeting — which was once again held in Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of students in attendance — centered around lengthy discussion of the u...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last night’s Associated Students Senate meeting — which was once again held in Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of students in attendance — centered around lengthy discussion of the university’s potential divestment from companies that allegedly support apartheid and violate human rights.<br>\nDuring the forum, students expressed their reasoning for supporting or opposing divestment — an issue that was first introduced at last week’s meeting, resulting in nine hours of heated debate. Academic Affairs Board External Co-Chair Adeel Lakhani said the senate’s responsibility is to actively and critically analyze all perspectives when considering whether or not to pass the resolution, entitled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid.”<br>\n“Active pursuit of understanding is different from being served arguments or ideology,” Lakhani said. “My main point was that consideration of this resolution should be limited to consideration of this resolution … this resolution does not address how to finally address all parties’ concerns but this resolution does make clear that all parties’ concerns should be respected.”<br>\nStudent Rosina Saeed, a supporter of divestment, said discrimination plays a large role in human rights violations occurring in Palestine.<br>\n“I would like to address apartheid,” Saeed said. “My definition of apartheid is racial segregation, simple as that.”<br>\nIn contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace member Rand Clark said support for divestment and anti-Semitism are mutually exclusive sentiments.<br>\n“A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude toward Jews,” Clark said. “A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”<br>\nRabbi Evan Goodman said the resolution has prompted strong reactions from students who feel personally attacked by the university’s potential divestment.<br>\n“One student I spoke to today, I spent a good hour trying to talk him out of withdrawing from the university,” Goodman said.<br>\nAccording to Meggie Le, A.S. President at UCSD, the resolution has been particularly controversial due to the complex and challenging nature of the conflict.<br>\n“Political issues will always be divisive in their nature, but this one is unique in that it is also alienating,” Le said.<br>\nDue to printing constraints, the full story could not be included in today’s issue.

The event also featured renowned public figures, such as journalist Stephen Colbert and economist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus. Over 1,000 students attended the conference, with UCSB students Olivia Wong, Alexander Scarlett and Jack John Amend attending the conference as representatives of nonprofit organization Inspire a Child — which was recently awarded the $10,000 Strauss Grant and officially supported by Chancellor Henry T. Yang.<br>\nWong, founder and executive director of Inspire a Child, said she has attended the conference once before and finds much inspiration and knowledge in participating in it. She said the involvement of fellow university students makes the event capable of producing real public policy action regarding prominent global issues.<br>\n“The most exciting thing [about CGIU] is that I am constantly pushed by my peers, challenged by their resolve and motivated to pursue my solution to the world’s greatest problems,” Wong said. “CGIU is not just a place to talk about ideas. It’s about turning an idea into action — taking that concrete step towards solving world hunger and ending poverty.”<br>\nThe conference included three sessions that targeted the main issues of discussion. One session — entitled “Getting off the Ground: Stories of Starting Up” — featured a panel of upcoming entrepreneurs, who shared their knowledge and experience in launching their own businesses. The second session, called “A Better Future for Girls and Women: Empowering the Next Generation,” welcomed professionals and other figures to discuss the many ways today’s youth can make the necessary changes and decisions to give a brighter future to girls and women worldwide. The last session, called “Solutions Without Borders: Working with Unlikely Allies,” brought together legislators and entrepreneurs to discuss the need for international cooperation.<br>\nAmend said Inspire a Child’s focus on helping youth is beneficial to the overall international community because the welfare of the world’s youth can greatly influence the welfare of the world as a whole.<br>\n“The international community knows full well that a driving force to the end of poverty is universal education, especially towards the younger generations as well as the promotion of women and girls rights,” Amend said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/","id":3090,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3089,3088,3087],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":82,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
