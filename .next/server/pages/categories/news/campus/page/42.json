Critics believed the resolution’s timing was purposefully malicious. SJP released a statement on their Facebook page denouncing the implication that the post was anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The proposal was endorsed by 25 other student organizations including the A.S. Student Commission on Racial Equality, El Congreso and the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Anumita Kaur, SJP member and fourth-year sociology major, sponsored the resolution, which she said SJP plans to place on the A.S. Senate agenda next week.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the student organization had two goals in creating the resolution, the first being the “tangible ask” of demanding UCSB and the UC system to remove funds from corporations that allegedly assist in violence against the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the resolution was also meant to be a way for the UC system to be held accountable and to focus on making ethical investments at all times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the organization’s second goal was to educate people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of people can’t even point to where Palestine is on the map, and it’s so important that people understand that this is a violence occurring on our globe,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an accompanying press release made public on Sunday, SJP said its resolution “is in no way intended to alienate students on campus; it is intended to create a critical dialogue about regimes participating in human rights violations.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The statement added that students were critical to social movements in the past and that UCSB must answer its duty as a top-level institution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have historically been at the forefront of social justice movements, from the Civil Rights Movement to South African Apartheid, student power has been an integral part of progress and change,” the statement read.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Belonging to a top tier research institution, it is our duty to combat racism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, imperialism, colonization and global inequality. We cannot exceptionalize Israel.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sunday’s resolution and press release are part of a years-long student effort to call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a “nonviolent movement that was called for by Palestinian Civil Society in 2005 in response to Israel’s disregard for international law,” as the statement describes it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said she believes if people were more understanding of SJP’s perspective, they might have less “volatile opinions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the biggest thing to understand about this movement and this resolution is that it’s really just premised on love; it’s premised on, you know, a desire for global humanity,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“All it is in its inherent nature is asking the university to remove funds from American corporations that assist in violence against a people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77403\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77403\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/","id":2392,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2391,2390,2389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"BLM Co-Founder Alicia Garza To Speak at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-5.38.44-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-5.38.44-PM.png?resize=778%2C451&ssl=1","description":"Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza will be the keynote speaker for the “Black Liberation: The Rose That Grew From Concrete” event on Wednesday evening, during which she will be sharing her...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza will be the keynote speaker for the “Black Liberation: The Rose That Grew From Concrete” event on Wednesday evening, during which she will be sharing her thoughts about the BLM movement and addressing discrimination in the United States.</p>\n<p>The free event will be in Campbell Hall and is part of UC Santa Barbara’s BLM Week organized by the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, the Black Student Engagement Program and Queer Commission. The week’s events aim to address the nature of institutionalized racism and its effect on society.</p>\n<p>Garza, current special projects director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, will share her call-to-action against discrimination in the U.S. and urge individuals to join the fight for justice for all black lives.</p>\n<p>Garza will also be featured in a sustainability workshop at 12 p.m. Wednesday in the Associated Students (A.S.) Pardall Center to discuss student activism, strategizing and movement.</p>\n<p>The BLM movement started in 2012 after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was posthumously put on trial for his own murder and the shooter, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of the murder charges.</p>\n<p>Martin’s death and Zimmerman’s acquisition sparked outrage across the country. Racial tension became the center of protests much like those in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by then police officer Darren Wilson.</p>\n<p>These cases prompted grassroots community organizing like BLM in response to the rising number of police shootings across the country.</p>\n<p>The internet responded to the growing tensions with #BlackLivesMatter.</p>\n<p>Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors and Garza, the BLM founders, transformed the viral hashtag into a movement that is now a chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life.</p>\n<p>According to their website, BLM strives to broaden the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state.</p>\n<p>“It was a response to the anti-Black racism that permeates our society and also, unfortunately, our movements,” wrote Garza in the “herstory” section of their website.</p>\n<p>Critics of the movement visited UCSB earlier this year and stirred controversy over free speech.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro, conservative political commentator and author, visited Campbell Hall in February for an event titled “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.” The lecture was previously entitled “Lies, Prejudice and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement.”</p>\n<p>The event was preempted by a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">six-hour-long A.S.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ben-shapiro-packs-campbell-hall-for-controversial-lecture/\">Shapiro later called the opposition “sort of fascist.”</a></p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He emphasized the importance of advocating for all students and making sure they know he will be there as a resource for them on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Kwok, a member of the Elections Committee, posed a series of questions, some created by the committee and others asked anonymously by audience members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some highlights: </span></p>\n<p><b>ON THE OFFICE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said one of his “prime concerns” was creating more awareness of the Office of the Student Advocate General, since currently only about 20 students use the office per quarter. He plans to try to increase use of the office by encouraging resident assistants (RA) to give incoming freshmen information about the office’s resources. He said he plans to put an “extremely high” emphasis on promoting the office.</span></p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he believes the election of President Donald Trump has made many students, particularly undocumented students, feel unsafe on campus. Another large issue is bringing controversial speakers to campus, and as Student Advocate General, Tannenbaum said he hopes to make sure students’ opinions are heard and that everyone feels safe. He also noted the rising costs of tuition and cliff erosion as big concerns for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON BEING IMPARTIAL: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Non-partisanship is extremely important,” Tannenbaum said. He said he takes his status as a non-partisan independent seriously, having sought the endorsement of both Campus Republicans and Democrats to show he is committed to representing all students, regardless of their views.</span></p>\n<p><b>ON INSTITUTIONAL RACISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tannenbaum said institutional racism is “one of the biggest issues in our country.” He said that as a white man, he has not experienced such racism but believes he can use his position to amplify the voices of those who do not feel heard on campus. Tannenbaum said he will try to make as many spaces safe on campus as possible and will do his best to make sure people’s voices are heard. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I don’t sleep enough,” Tannenbaum said. “I push myself to work very hard and that often goes late into the night.” He said self care will be very important for him to do his best as Student Advocate General. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON EMOTIONAL LABOR: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he had not heard the term “emotional labor” in an “official context” but believes it is the “effort and emotion put into one’s work.” He said A.S. sometimes ignores the effort and time students put into the issues they are invested in on campus. He said, if elected, he will strive to work to make sure A.S. understands how much students care about critical issues on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum also fielded more lighthearted questions, revealing that his favorite board game is Diplomacy, a game that requires negotiation among players. He said he hopes to take the passion he has for the game to be as passionate about his work as Student Advocate General.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum closed the forum by reiterating that he wants students to feel “heard, safe and represented,” something he feels is oftentimes overlooked within the community and student government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum, describing himself as “a pretty loud guy,” said he will do his best to make sure everyone is heard and that there are resources available for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please know that I care about the students on this campus, and I really strive to make this a home for everybody,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The cameras are purchased by the department and, according to Howard, typically cost between $300 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>There is not, however, a thorough policy in place that outlines the steps taken to install a camera, and the university is currently in the process of drafting a new policy for installing security cameras. The university’s latest policy was created in May 2008.</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said that under current policy, camera footage is accessed and monitored by each department that owns the camera. The footage is only released during police investigations or when there is compelling interest to uncover what was filmed.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the university is in the process of creating a new policy to specifically outline the regulation of camera use.</p>\n<p>“It’ll vary by various departments, and this is a reason why we’ve started the dialogue,” Hall said. “We want a policy that says, ‘If you’re going to manage a camera, there are practices and standards to which you have to adhere that balance privacy, safety and security.’”</p>\n<p>The group drafting the new university policy was created around four months ago and consists of law enforcement, university administrators, university staff members and Jennifer Lofthus, the chief of information and security officer.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President is also creating a new system-wide policy change.</p>\n<p>According to Hall, security cameras pose an “ethical burden” due to controversy between increasing surveillance and maintaining people’s privacy. He also described them as a “monetary burden” because individual departments pay for their installed cameras.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the installation of security cameras undergoes a different process for interior and exterior cameras, as “staff issues and union issues” may arise when such groups deny access to being filmed inside buildings.</p>\n<p>“We have to consider there are certain labor classifications that explicitly prohibit this particular thing,” he said.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants the future policy to include a requirement to attend a privacy training for those who request cameras to learn how “to respect the privacy of our community.”</p>\n<p>Many students may not be aware of security cameras, and Hall said the new policy will designate more signage to show students where they are being surveilled.</p>\n<p>Hall said he estimates that the policy will be completed by the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get everybody to a similar standard,” Hall said. “The policy is deliberate and thoughtful, and we want to make sure there’s time for review and there’s time for dissemination and there’s time for criticism.”</p>\n<p>Ruby Stewart, a first-year psychology major, was studying on the fourth floor of the library when she noticed the security camera hovering above her.</p>\n<p>“I honestly didn’t know there was cameras,” she said. “I don’t feel uncomfortable, though, because I feel like it kind of makes sense. I feel like if they’re misusing it, just to kind of like, watch us, that’s creepy. But if they have like a purpose, then it’s fine with me.”</p>\n<p>Stewart said she thinks the cameras would be useful if there were a crime in the library, but she said students should be more aware of the cameras’ presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know … so obviously there should be more signs,” she said. “Because if you have signs, people will say, ‘Oh, there’s cameras, I shouldn’t do anything stupid in here.’”</p>\n<p>According to Gary Johnson, the associate university librarian for research and scholar services, there are cameras on every floor of the library, the majority being on the first floor due to the amount of general and emergency exits.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants to remind students that they are “under constant personal surveillance in the world,” and the presence of cameras on a university campus is typical due to the high volume of visitors and amount of expensive infrastructure and research equipment.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to clarify [students’] rights through policy,” Hall said. “The university has not only a right but a compelling interest in surveilling an area to make sure you’re safe and to make sure our property is protected.”</p>\n<p>Abigail Hunt, a first-year biology major, said she doesn’t mind having cameras on campus because they act as a “safety precaution.”</p>\n<p>“It makes me feel safe, like if something did happen they’d be able to record it,” Hunt said. “But I don’t feel the need to know where things are because I don’t feel like I do anything that I should worried about being watched.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

precedent in creating a more environmentally friendly setting within the campus and improving the quality and health of the lives of students who will be living in these off-campus dorms next year.</p>\n<p>The San Joaquin apartment renovations are one of the largest projects underway at UC Santa Barbara, with a proposed amount of $122 million going toward construction and an estimated 670,000 hours worked to date.</p>\n<p>Upon completion, it will accommodate 186 units, housing a total of 1,019 beds for potential students living on campus over 14 acres of site development, all while including new sustainable and energy-saving features.</p>\n<p>The apartments will use the standards of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), a global green building certification program, in addition to current campus green building goals in measuring their environmental efficiency.</p>\n<p>Such certifications are based on the various components of the apartment complex and how efficiently these different factors contribute to a more environmentally friendly site, according to the LEED construction certification requirements.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings featured within the San Joaquin apartment complexes will be able to reach the LEED Gold standard, the second highest green-efficiency level behind Platinum.</p>\n<p>Among the new features of San Joaquin apartment complexes is a revamped version of the Portola Dining Commons, a marketplace at which students can buy groceries, as well as various outdoor recreational facilities such as basketball and volleyball courts.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost like a mini-campus away from campus,” said Marc Rousseau, the energy and environmental manager for residential operations. “[The marketplace] will make it easier for students to not have to go all the way down to Costco to shop for groceries.”</p>\n<p>Rousseau said the original intent behind making these apartments more environmentally friendly was in response to student demands at UC meetings in pushing for greener construction as well as sustainability in the buildings.</p>\n<p>“I like to say that it’s student-driven why we’re here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Brian Graham, project manager for the construction site, said in addition to the apartment buildings being more environmentally friendly, such installments will help save costs of maintenance and repair in the future.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the sustainable buildings do cost more upfront, but they do have a somewhat higher payback,” Graham said.</p>\n<p>Features such as sensor-based lights, which remotely turn off when not being used, as well as the use of recycled water, help alleviate the costs of energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Rousseau said while the environmental aspects of San Joaquin are major highlights in its construction, it is only one small project in the larger view of environmental conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“This project isn’t going to save the world,” he said. “But it’s a great example of things that operators and building owners can do when they make a change.”</p>\n<p>Rousseau said such environmental efforts are created in the hopes of improving both the lives of students

Greater understanding of these environmental aspects can lead to more awareness of the topic of environmental conservation, he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s to build an environmentally friendly building and a building which students can live safely and learn in,” Rousseau said. “That’s why we’re here. And to live in a community that’s comfortable and healthy.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/","id":2390,"author":{"id":97,"name":"Matthew Wu"},"related":[2389,2388,2387],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Parker J.

His father said Parker expanded his knowledge of history through these conventions. The conventions were their tradition, and Rand said, “It’s gonna be tough next year knowing that I won’t share that with him.”</p>\n<p>Once he became a history buff, Rand said Parker was fascinated by the controversy and treaties that evolved from World War II.</p>\n<p>Parker’s favorite person in history was Winston Churchill, his dad said, and the two once visited Churchill’s secret subterranean command center on a family vacation to London. “It was tough to pull him out of there,” Rand said.</p>\n<p>Parker’s room was full of books, Rand said, and he particularly liked science fantasy novels. He loved “Star Wars” and was just starting to get into “Star Trek,” beginning with the T.V. show. “He wasn’t a big fan of the movies,” Rand said, describing Parker as a “purist” when it came to pop culture.</p>\n<p>“He was an old rocker at heart; he was a huge Beatles fan,” Rand said. The White Album was likely Parker’s favorite, and his dad said Parker once went out of his way to find the album for his younger sister. The album will be placed at his service on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“That’s the kind of thing he was doing. He was always looking out for others,” Rand said. “The caring person that he was, he always championed people that were left to the side and the people who fell behind.”</p>\n<p>A group of nearly 20 people from Adventure Programs held a memorial for Parker Monday at Campus Point, gathering next to a rental office where Williams worked and spent much of his time on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77034\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1081213815\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77182\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77034\" data-attachment-id=\"77034\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A group of students from Adventure Programs gather around a fire at Campus Point to remember Parker J. Williams on Monday, April 17. <em>Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Huddled close to each other around a small fire, the circle took in the sound of crashing waves, wrote messages to Parker and chose to either toss in the notes or share their memories aloud.</p>\n<p>Several members of the group worked closely with Parker after he completed his Leadership Training Course last year and remembered him as diligent, careful person who had an “eagerness to do well for others.”</p>\n<p>“The world was better with him in it,” one friend said, adding that Parker had “a magical presence that made you feel comfortable.” Another recounted her shifts working the rental office with Parker, saying he made her a better employee and a better person.</p>\n<p>Rand shared with the Nexus a speech Parker presented at his Eagle Court of Honor ceremony. It is printed it here in its entirety:</p>\n<p><em>“Scouting for me was never about the Eagle. I’ve always been more enamored by the journey…Nothing can take from me the majesty of watching a sunset from the top of Big Bear Mountain, the calm of napping near a gentle creek in Whitsett forest, the rush of adrenaline from fighting white water in the Kern River Valley…Whenever I need a reprieve from life’s sad noise or dull hum, all I need to do is remember the beauty and vivacity of nature, and suddenly, I have the motivation to push on so that I may explore more of these unique paradises…what has made my time here (Scouting) truly enjoyable has been the time spent with friends.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ll never remember the hundreds of conversations that were had, but I will remember the smiling and laughing, simply being content. An indicator of this is that no matter where we go camping, the heart of the trip always seems to be at night when we all gather around a campfire, a lamp lit table, or all cram inside one tent to play cards while laughing away the troubles we left at home. It is an innumerable amount of amazing memories…and each one I will look fondly upon for the rest of my life.”</em></p>\n<p><a

Here are highlights for answers to questions from the moderator, Mary Zhu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>CONNECTIONS:</b> Zhu asked the candidates if they have sustainable statewide networks to work with as EVPSA. Hsu cited her past three years of experience in A.S., specifically her involvement in the UCSB Federal Advocacy Program that sends students to Washington D.C. to lobby, which has established networks at the federal and UC level. Dagnachew said that as mental health coordinator, he helped start peer programs similar to UCSB’s at UCLA and UC Irvine. He said he has met other student leaders at U.S. Student Association (USSA) with similar if not the same goals for fighting tuition hikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>GRASSROOTS OR LOBBYING?: </b>Hsu said change comes with both lobbying and grassroots organizing and it is important to realize that students have different strengths in participating to voice their concerns. Dagnachew agreed that both lobbying and grassroots work are effective, and he said he wants to work toward having students see the connection with their own efforts to the actions going on at the state and federal levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY:</b> In response to a question about increasing student accessibility to the EVPSA, Dagnachew said his involvement in various organizations, canvassing for student programs such as CLAS and working as a Resident Assistant have prepared him to reach out to students. Hsu said it can be a challenge to be approachable, but she hopes to focus on communicating legislation to students that is not always clear to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/","id":2388,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2387,2386,2385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"External Vice President of Local Affairs Debate: Dumlao vs. Stoll","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0285-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0285-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Candidates for the Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs met Wednesday to contend why they are best qualified to represent students to the county on issues that include communit...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Candidates for the Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs met Wednesday to contend why they are best qualified to represent students to the county on issues that include community policing, tenants’ rights and sexual assault prevention.</p>\n<p>The election of this year’s EVPLA comes at a turning point in Isla Vista’s political history.

Elections Board and those anonymously shared from the audience.</p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of the topics discussed in Wednesday’s EVPLA forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SAFETY: </b>Stoll said she is working to create a police collaborative board of law enforcement officers, community members and students who would meet to offer individuals the opportunity to voice their concerns to law enforcement in a formal setting so that issues are “transparent” and people can engage in open dialogues regarding them. Stoll added this board would allow the police to address community concerns directly in a manner that is open to the public. Dumlao said having more training for the police force in I.V. is a crucial part of how they interact with the community and the current trainings are insufficient. He added that C.A.R.E. training, LGBTQ training, a racial-sensitivity training and a religious safety training are all necessary to prepare them to engage with the diverse population in I.V. Dumlao also said he wants to create more of a culture of community policing because Isla Vistans are capable and willing to care for their community and “don’t need an extreme police force every time there is a huge event in Isla Vista” to keep the community safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FIRST PRIORITIES: </b>Stoll said her first priority upon taking office would be to assist students struggling with tenants’ rights by creating an online platform similar to Rate My Professor but with profiles on landlords. On this site, students could discuss in an open forum issues relating to maintenance and legalities. She said she also aims to establish a community court in I.V. at which students could address minor misdemeanors instead of having to go to downtown Santa Barbara to deal with common tickets like minor in possession and drunk in public. Dumlao said his first priority would be to create sexual assault policies that serve the needs of survivors in I.V. and reverse the trend of incidents going unreported by working with the C.A.R.E. office and CSD to “empower survivors to come out and tell their stories and gain support.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FAMILIES: </b>Stoll said the best thing to do to help the families living in I.V. is to support the CSD and all its efforts to bring them into the community because, as a representative of students, it’s not her position to support their needs directly. She said she would support the CSD board’s aims to create tenant mediation and translation services specifically designed for these families. Dumlao said the first step to helping I.V. families is to reach out to them to learn more about their needs, followed by further action to create a community culture that “revolves around safety and love.” He said he plans to foster this through mentorship programs and increased resources available to all community members, regardless if they are students, such as a food bank and C.A.R.E. offices.\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_77104\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77104\" data-attachment-id=\"77104\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/dsc_0081-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0081 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77104\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=700%2C467\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tatiana </em>Karme<em>-Scalisi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PARKING: </b>Dumlao suggested establishing a UCSB shuttle system that would employ student workers and decrease carbon emissions, as well as designating a location outside of I.V. to park cars during Deltopia weekend, free of charge. Stoll said while one of the eight powers of the CSD is to create a parking program, she hopes to address the problem of overcrowded streets in I.V. more immediately by creating parking spots on the streets and developing alternate forms of transportation for students to deter them from bringing cars to I.V.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>HATE CRIMES: </b>Stoll said the best way to address hate crimes is to host open dialogues to break down walls within the community and increase transparency among all communities. Dumlao said there is no way to ensure LGBTQ students don’t experience hate crimes and that verbal violence affects all communities and can lead to physical violence. He said addressing a hate crime incident immediately will increase transparency, and making resources known to victims is important to demonstrate that “we don’t stand for it and that we are willing to talk about it.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>NOISE ORDINANCE:</b> Dumlao said a 10 p.m. noise ordinance through the weekend would not be a good idea because students need time to relax. He also said that, for many communities that are race-based, loud music and dancing are part of social gatherings. He added that the ordinance could increase tension between students and law enforcement and that there should be an emphasis on increased cooperation between neighbors regarding noise. Stoll said the county’s decision over summer to vote on the 10 p.m. noise ordinance without consulting student opinions is evidence of a “systemic problem” that has existed for decades, in which the county decides on policies for I.V. while students have no voice. She said working with the CSD will ensure that students are consulted by representatives to create continuity on policies that affect I.V. residents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>COMMUNITY RESOURCES:</b> Stoll said she has discussed various projects with the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), including a website to profile landlords and also a mobile application that lists students’ rights as tenants. On the app, students could upload a part of their lease to have an open dialogue and learn how to deal with problems with their landlords. “This is the first time they have probably entered into any kind of legal contract as an adult, and it’s really difficult to understand the legalities. There’s a lot of loopholes. I think landlords take advantage of the fact that students don’t really know what they’re doing,” she said. Dumlao argued that many students don’t have the option to access resources like IVTU amid their studies and jobs, so IVTU staff should go door-to-door to reach those people who are “not privileged enough” to access them on their own time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES: </b>Dumlao said being able to reach out to people who are undocumented to communicate to them their rights, with translation services available, is key because many members of the undocumented community don’t have the time to access the resources available to them. “They’re really just surviving on a day-to-day basis. Our job is to make sure they can thrive wherever they are living,” he said. Stoll said she would support efforts to create a sanctuary county in Santa Barbara because members of the undocumented community should be allowed to live their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>POLICE BRUTALITY: </b>Stoll said the best means of addressing police brutality is to break down barriers between the community and law enforcement. She re-emphasized the importance of creating a police collaborative board. “We need to hold them accountable as people part of our community, but we owe them the benefit of the doubt as well … they are here to keep us safe at the end of the day,” she said. Dumlao again said one way to combat police mistreatment is to hold additional trainings for police officers. “The police do get paid to do their job, and we need to make sure we are giving them the resources to do their job as efficiently as they possibly can,” he said.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each of their closing remarks, both candidates emphasized their dedication to working alongside the CSD board to create a strong and safe community in I.V.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she plans to address each of the issues in the I.V. community one-by-one in the most thorough way possible and will draw on her experience as an off-campus senator and a member of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“Knowing our representatives [and] being a part of these community meetings, I feel that I will be the best person to represent student voices in our local government and in our county and make sure Isla Vista stays strong and stays safe and students are aware of their resources and representation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dumlao emphasized that it is extremely important to him to ensure that all I.V. residents are welcomed and safe in I.V. by making sure that the the CSD hears marginalized students’ voices.</p>\n<p>“There are many communities in Isla Vista that don’t feel welcome and don’t feel safe all the time,” Dumlao said. “We want to make sure that Isla Vista is a place that we all feel loved.”</p>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/","id":2386,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2385,2384,2383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: Off-Campus Senator Candidate Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.</p>\n<p>Taking part in the off-campus senator forum were five Isla Vista Party candidates — Brandon Mora, Sami Kaayal, Veronica Leeman, Alexandra Gessesse and Ilene Ochoa — and six Campus United candidates — Kristen Armellini, Adham Btaddini, Deepika Chandrashekar, Sophia Dycaico, Sam Cook and Dominick DiCesare.</p>\n<p>Campus United candidates for off-campus senator — Alison Sir, Adnan Mansur, Anthony Pimentel, Evan Quash and Dhishal Jayasinghe — participated in the forum with the collegiate senator candidates due to an Elections Board scheduling mishap.</p>\n<p>Candidates Carla Martinez, Siboney Arias, Mara Joy Abubo and Justin Deckard did not show for Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Each candidate was given one minute to introduce themselves and their party position.

Regarding Deltopia, Ochoa said the successful community outreach done by UC Isla Vista (UCIV) this year was indicative of what the I.V. community should represent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Cook, a first-year political science major, said he understands the importance in providing a space for the LGBTQ community to share their voice. As vice president of Santa Catalina Hall Council, he said he has helped to created events for LGBTQ students in the hall. Cook said the UCIV program played a crucial role in Deltopia this year, and the university’s provision of the Warm Up concert was a great incentive as well, proving that “the University has truly come full circle on how they view Deltopia and it will only get better from here.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mora, a third-year political science and sociology double major, said he would like to see the expansion of non-gendered bathrooms on campus so the LGBTQ community can be more included on campus. Mora said the university should ensure that the police presence in Isla Vista stays true to the approachable demeanor they held this year, rather than the more hostile demeanor Mora said the police assumed in prior years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Gessesse, a first-year history of public policy and sociology double major, said she wants to expand the definition of safe spaces for the LGBTQ community on campus to include restrooms and bathrooms. Gessesse said she wants the university to work closely alongside the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) during Deltopia. According to Gessesse, “the university spent a lot of money on advertisements that could be geared towards partnership towards creating safety with I.V. CSD.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Btaddini, a second-year political science major, said he wants to “empower the students here that are making an effort to fight for the LGBTQ community and represent students on campus.” Regarding the university’s role during Deltopia, Btaddini said the university should foster the kind of culture that does not punish students on big events, but looks out for their safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dycaico, a second-year history of public policy major, said if elected, she plans to reach out to LGBTQ communities to ensure they are heard and represented. She said the role the university plays in holding alternative events during Deltopia is an effective safety measure, especially when coupled with the help of UCIV.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DiCesare, a third-year computer science major, said he plans to use his platform “to bring different groups and ideologies on this campus together so we can have a better environment for this campus no matter who you are or what you identify as.” DiCesare said he believes students, as members of the university and as a part of the Isla Vista community, should all take steps during Deltopia to ensure that students are safe in all instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leeman, a second-year mathematical science and German double major, said she wants to reach out to professors to ensure they are incorporating “inclusive language in their syllabi and lectures” for the LGBTQ community. Leeman said the university’s role during Deltopia should be more proactive and less reactive and focus on educating students about why it is in their best interest to protect Isla Vista.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Chandrashekar, a first-year communication major, said that if elected, she plans on making it a point to start a conversation with the LGBTQ community, go to their meetings and hear what their concerns are. She also said students should have a voice in regard to the university funding of precautionary advertisements against Deltopia and where that funding may be better spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Kaayal, a second-year biology major, said he hopes to promote as many safe spaces on campus for the LGBTQ community as possible. Concerning the university’s role during Deltopia, Kaayal said he hopes to promote the idea of community policing. He said he believes the university should increase the jurisdiction of CSOs instead of bringing police in from other areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Armellini, a second-year history of public policy major, said she wants to “amplify” the voices in the LGBTQ community and “make sure they’re heard and taken care of.” She said the University’s approach to Deltopia should involve providing students with education, events and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mansur, a third-year statistics major, said he wants to help students get jobs after graduation, and plans to make Career Services more accessible. He also wants to increase alumni connections with current students. If elected, he said he wants to help students know where their student fees are going.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Sir, a first-year political science major, said she wants to represent minority communities and increase visibility of student resources. If elected, Sir said she wants to expand the A.S. Food Bank to Isla Vista so students can have access to it when off campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Pimentel, a second-year political major, said he wants to help keep student fees affordable and facilitate student-run businesses. If elected, he said he wants to serve as the liaison between the student body and the university administration and use A.S. to empower students.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Quash, a first-year statistical science and black studies double major, said he wants to increase off-campus students’ representation. If elected, Quash said he plans to achieve his goals as a senator through maintaining an open dialogue between A.S. and the administration to address issues such as college affordability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jayasinghe, a second-year philosophy and global studies double major, said he wants to fix the biggest problems in Isla Vista including parking and work alongside the CSD. If elected, Jayasinghe said he hopes to use his experience of working in the External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office to improve the community and open the dialogue to include all opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a

The first question pertained to the use of hate speech on campus, while the second one asked the candidates how they plan to work with the administration to achieve their goals as senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds for opening and closing remarks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates explained to audience members their plans for improving the lives of UCSB students. Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar, a third-year anthropology major, said she wants to “pioneer” a transfer commission and help marginalized students feel more represented on campus. She said she believes that while there is a constitutional right to free speech, the university should “not entertain” hate speech and help maintain an environment free from violence.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh, a third-year biology major, said he wants to improve CLAS access for transfer students and expand transfer orientation, two issues he wants to work on with the university administrators. He said it is an “amazing time” to be a transfer student, and he wants to focus his efforts on increasing support for them. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey, a second-year global studies and geography double major, said he wants to use his “passion for academics” and “ability to strive as a leader” to serve his community. According to Carey, hate speech should not be tolerated on campus, and he hopes he can “use existing channels” of communication with campus administrators to achieve his goals as a senator.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a third-year political science major, said she wants students to know how A.S. can affect change on campus. She also said she wants to “streamline” the dialogue between A.S. and university administrators and work to decrease tuition and increase class enrollment availability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel, a second-year political science major, said she wants to ensure that student fees are seen through student resources. Kopel said she believes hate speech can make some students “feel alienated” on campus and wants to help facilitate productive dialogue between differing groups. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banicki, a first-year biology major, said he wants to create more outdoor study spaces and hammocks on campus. He also said he wants to emphasize mental health and extend resources to students who may feel overwhelmed. As the president of the Santa Catalina South Residence Hall, he said he already “has a foot in the door” to work with university administrators. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez, a second-year sociology and economics double major, said she wants to increase representation of minority groups on campus. If elected, she said, she hopes to make college life more affordable and accessible to students.      </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uemura, a first-year chemistry major, said she wants to implement a mental health counselor for CCS and ensure an open dialogue with campus administrators. She said she believes there is a “fine line” between hate speech and free speech and said she hopes to maintain CCS as a “very safe space” that is welcome to everyone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almas, a second-year chemical engineering major, said he wants to work on making college more affordable for students, citing the high costs of tutoring and textbooks. He said he wants to create an open dialogue with administrators to ensure that the College of Engineering can be a safe and affordable environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond, a second-year electrical engineering major, said he is excited about the future of A.S. and wants to increase students’ awareness about the university’s “incredible” resources including UCIV and the Community Housing Office.

Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed 12 questions, created prior to the debate by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the rest of the highlights from Monday’s presidential debate:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>COMMUNITY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Asked to define “community,” Nemeh gave a simple answer: “Isla Vista.” Nemeh said the university, police and Santa Barbara County have not prioritized student needs in their decisions concerning Isla Vista, which he said he hopes to address as president. Le said community is “being a Gaucho,” and he added that he plans to increase career planning services and expand the alumni recruitment network.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>POLICE PRESENCE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they felt police presence made the campus safer, to which Nemeh responded, “No.” Nemeh said the campus needs to “reevaluate our relationship with police,” citing an incident in February where a female skateboarder was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcibly detained</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Arbor after she attempted to flee from receiving a ticket. Nemeh advocated instead for  what he called “community-based policing.” Le said Nemeh “highlighted the cons” of campus police presence, but he wanted to “highlight the pros.” He said the police departments have made progress in “demilitarizing” their officers, and he cited the “substantial decrease” in the number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrests at Deltopia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this year.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nemeh said the attribute that uniquely qualifies him for president is his “pre-existing understanding” of A.S., having worked with the student government for the past three years. Le said his qualifying attribute is his “leadership capabilities,” and as president he said he wants to implement a “bottom-up” approach. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When asked how he has been an advocate for marginalized communities, Le cited his lobbying experience. He said he wants to empower students of marginalized communities rather than the “top-down” approach of advocating for them In response to the same question, Nemeh cited his work toward implementing the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single Transferrable Vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which he said makes voting more “equitable” in A.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>STUDENT FEES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first audience question of the day asked the candidates what they will do to ensure fiscal responsibility in light of the fact that UCSB students pay the highest student fees in the UC. Le said he plans to start a program for students to run their own businesses, which he said will create an alternate revenue source for A.S. Nemeh said A.S. needs to prioritize on eliminating tuition rather than reducing student fees.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS + LOCAL:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they view the position of A.S. president only working on campus issues. Nemeh said the Isla Vista Party wants to work directly with the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) and alongside the student governments of other UC campuses. Le said the president needs to help be present in statewide affairs and in making sure that President Donald Trump does not “encroach on our campus.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The next audience question asked the candidates if they had ever worked with UCSB Undocumented Student Services. Nemeh said he has “not directly” worked with the program, but he hopes to pick a qualified undocumented students services coordinator to work in the Office of the A.S. President. Le cited his experience lobbying to make California a “sanctuary state” and working alongside state legislators to push such legislation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS CLIMATE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another audience question asked the candidate to give their thoughts on campus climate in regard to a recent visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ben-shapiro-packs-campbell-hall-for-controversial-lecture/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a cancelled visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-11/milo-yiannopoulos-visit-canceled-at-uc-santa-barbara/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milo Yiannopoulos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Le said he supports freedom of speech “so long that these speakers abide by university conduct and they do not incite harm.” Le also mentioned how he was once a registered Republican in high school and has since switched party affiliations. Nemeh said he does not tolerate “students coming out and attacking other students for their identities,” citing the violence that erupted from Yiannopoulos’s visit to Berkeley in February. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEADERSHIP:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked what is the most important quality of a leader, Le said a leader must be able to listen to the issues of students on campus. Doerr did not pose the same question to Nemeh.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SPECIAL PROJECTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr asked each candidate if they planned to undertake any special projects should either of them become president. Nemeh mentioned again the “$48 fix,” but he also said he wants to implement an open-source textbook library. Le cited again his work to eliminate student tuition through the state legislature.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEGACY:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about the legacy they would want to leave, Le answered that it is not about leaving a legacy but rather about setting up a foundation for future student leaders. “Coming in with the mindset that we have to do everything in one year is not practical and feasible,” he said. Nemeh said he would like to strengthen communication between A.S. and university administration so that everyone is not “trying to reinvent the wheel from the beginning.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>ANTI-SEMITISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last audience question of the day asked the candidates how they plan to address the anti-Semitism on campus that may result from the Israel-Palestine conflict. Le said the campus needs to facilitate “ a civil discourse between Muslim groups on campus and the Jewish organizations.” Nemeh disagreed with Le, saying the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a Muslim-Jewish conflict. “Students who have disagreements with each other on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have it because of political disagreements, not religious ones,” he said.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FREEDOM OF SPEECH:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates to give their stance on the abilities and rights of students to protest. Both candidates said it is a constitutionally protected right. Nemeh said he is a strong supporter of demonstration, which he said helps to produce “new forms of knowledge.” Le said students should be able to express themselves freely and the campus should not be censoring any viewpoints.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>PRIVILEGE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked “what does privilege mean to you,” Nemeh recalled being able to move safely back to the U.S. from Syria at the start of the Syrian Civil War. Le recalled being the son of a Vietnamese refugee and the first in his family to attend a university.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FUN FACT: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le also shared a “fun fact” that he was “born on the 4th of July.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each of their closing remarks, both candidates said again that they want to focus on reducing the costs of attending university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. Elections began 8 p.m. Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of Apr. 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/","id":2412,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2411,2410,2409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andy Doerr, manager of the A.S. Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed six questions, formed by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights of Monday’s IVP candidate forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When asked about the largest problem with A.S., Sandhu cited what she called the “inability” of new senators to become comfortable and accustomed to their new position. Silva, meanwhile, said A.S. should “step up on accountability by making the association more public” and increase transparency with the work on-campus senators participate in.</li>\n<li>Both candidates listed passion as an important quality to have as an IVP. “Those with passion can dedicate themselves to the job can do it well effectively and efficiently,” Sandhu said.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would preserve a civil environment in Senate, Silva said she would make the senators “feel validated” for their work. Sandhu said she would “empower” senators to serve their constituents.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would train new senators, Sandhu said she would “revamp” senator training in the summer and focus on building strong connections with Boards and Commissions. Silva said she wants outgoing senators to train incoming senators through “informative workshops.”</li>\n<li>In terms of the connections that each candidate had for both student leaders and administrators around campus, Silva cited her working relationships with administrative officials like Assistant Director for Government Affairs LaDonte King, Executive Director Marisela Marquez and her history with student groups like the Black Student Union. Sandhu emphasized on the importance of maintaining these relationships and said she was “fortunate to have connected with different students on campus.”</li>\n<li>An audience member asked the candidates how familiar they are with the internal workings of an organization. Sandhu said she was the class president through fifth grade and high school and served as a senator this year. Silva said she has been “privileged” to have mentors within the association and understands the different perspectives of members of the association through their work on the budget.</li>\n<li>In her closing remarks, Silva said she is grateful for the opportunity to run for office and for those who have supported her. Sandhu said she loves UCSB and wants all students to have a positive experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S.

Andrew Doerr, the forum moderator, then asked each candidate two questions and each candidate had thirty seconds to make a concluding statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr first asked the candidates to identify the most important issue affecting on-campus residents. The second question, posed by the audience, addressed resident assistant (R.A.) welfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each prospective senator identified a set of issues that they wanted to address.

When asked about R.A. welfare, he said “being there for them is a huge deal,” and wants residents to reach out to R.A.s to “lend them a hand … and acknowledge their presence.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang, a first-year political science and chemistry double major, said he wants to implement rollover and guest meal swipes for the dining commons, as well as increase the number of study spaces on campus.

When asked about R.A. welfare, Santos said he wants to create an A.S.-funded “mental-health social” for the R.A.s.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadeghi, a first-year political science major, stated he wants to limit the amount of stress for students and increase convenience on campus through providing more water stations in the resident halls and bike lanes at the Arbor. Sadeghi said he wants to partner with C.A.P.S. to provide a program for R.A.s as well as improve the relationship between R.A.s and residents.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goldman, a first-year physics major, said he wants to increase the amount of diversity in S.T.E.M. classes. He also said the rising cost of tuition is the most important issue affecting UCSB students. If elected, he said wants to create a catered mental health group and change the drug and alcohol policy to help R.A.s become healthier leaders.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, a first-year undeclared student, said she wants to revise UCSB’s alcohol and drug program, which puts “unnecessary stress on student’s mental health.” When asked about R.A. welfare, she said she wants to increase R.A. approachability for students by changing the alcohol and drug policy for residents.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressman Salud Carbajal spoke at UCSB on Monday about the difficulty of passing Democratic legislation in a Republican-majority Congress. <em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Carbajal expressed hesitant hope for progressive legislation under the Trump administration but attempted to ensure the town hall attendees that he would do what he could despite being a Democrat in a Republican-majority congress.</p>\n<p>The congressman has sponsored or co-sponsored over 60 bills since being elected to Congress in November and said 25 of the bills have been bipartisan.</p>\n<p>“I still believe there’s always room for collaboration,” he said, despite the currently divided political climate.</p>\n<p>The town hall, hosted by the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, was divided into three sections of discussion: the environment, education and immigration. Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/","id":2719,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2718,2717,2716],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":42,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
