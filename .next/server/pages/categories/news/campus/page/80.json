Local student DJs were judged by a checklist system based on mixing ability, song selection, originality, energy and audience response. The four DJs with the highest scores — Beta wave, PsychoJohn, T-Fresh and Dropwise — will move on to the next round at tonight’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator Karen Masumoto, third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major, Battle of the DJs is a new incarnation of the annual Program Board event Battle of the Bands, which also aims to spotlight local student talent.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to do something new,” Masumoto said. “We always have transitions during Extravaganza when there’s no music playing, so we thought that during that time we could really use DJs. And we kind of wanted to spotlight all the DJs in Isla Vista since there’s so many house parties that have talented DJs.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Speak Volumes editor-in-chief Dylan Chase — who is one member of DJ duo PsychoJohn — said the event allowed electronic music artists across “a whole gradient” to display their different brands of talent, utilizing different techniques ranging from controllers to vinyl to CDs to live mixing.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to show that DJing is a craft and that there are varying levels,” Chase said. “We try to incorporate different stuff into our routine. We do live performance and play vinyl records.”</p>\n<p>Describing their music as a “dreamy and ephemeral kind of house vibe” that ranges from “soul and funk music,” Chase and his DJ partner — third-year film &amp; media studies major Alex Ho — have already played shows at I.V. Theatre, Indochine and SoHo in addition to last night’s performance at the Hub. According to Chase, he and Ho “like to play that funky shit.”</p>\n<p>Tyler Fish, a fourth-year communication major who goes by the DJ name T-Fresh, described his music as “bouncy and highly energetic” and he said the roots of his DJ career go back to his freshman year during Deltopia, which he described as “pretty fucking legendary.”</p>\n<p>“I was a drummer all my life and I was in numerous bands … then I realized that bands aren’t playing backyards on DP — it’s DJs,” Fish said. “So I picked up my first pair of turn tables, sold my drum set and got some speakers.”</p>\n<p>Chemistry graduate student Matthew Snedaker, a.k.a. DJanet Napolitano, said his influences are rooted in hip hop and that his DJ name is derived from his views on the UC President.</p>\n<p>“I really like Janet Napolitano as a person. I think it’s really important to have a woman in this position,” Snedacker said, “But you have to also consider that she’s a politician and she’s making an absurd amount of money when she should be a public servant, and that bothers me a lot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies and sociology double major Ashkan Karimloo — whose DJ name is Kuro—said Battle of the DJs has allowed upcoming talent in the newly emerging electronic music scene to distinguish and legitimize their craft.</p>\n<p>“With DJs, there’s usually this kind of stigma that they just stand there and press play,” Karimloo said. “This is cool because it shows what people can actually do, and it’s good to just to get word out that there’s this different variety of talent and music being played.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54077-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Front-page-DJ-photo_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=2090%2C1362\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54082\",\"title\":\"Front page DJ photo_Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/bottom-right-DJ-Photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=4163%2C2439\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54081\",\"title\":\"bottom right DJ Photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Bottom-left-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54080\",\"title\":\"Bottom left DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-right-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=902%2C900\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54079\",\"title\":\"Upper right DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-left-DJ-photo_Kenneth.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54078\",\"title\":\"Upper left DJ photo_Kenneth\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song &amp;

Representatives from the Student Commission on Racial Equality and the Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs also gave presentations on ongoing projects, in addition to the discussion of other issues and projects, such as a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert that will be held at the Hub on Mar. 6.</p>\n<p>In regard to the marijuana legalization debate, Senators decided to revisit discussion on the bill near the end of the meeting after it had already been passed without deliberation. This discussion incited passionate exchanges on both sides of the issue, with Senators Andre Theus, Amir Khazhaeli, Nick Onyshko, and Montana MacLachlan voicing opposition to the bill. Khazaieli said he feared the bill would reflect badly on UCSB’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“As representatives of the entire student body, taking a stance like this is completely counteractive to the whole notion of promoting UCSB as not a party school, not an ‘OK, get high and not care about anything,’” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Taylor supported the bill, and referred to a position supported by Assemblymember Das Williams, and he argued that one potential benefit of legalization would be the reduction of violence and profits connected to transnational drug cartels.</p>\n<p>“If the taxation happens and we legalize it, that could be taking money out of drug cartels,” Taylor said. “If there is a legalization and it’s going towards a good cause, not only will it be going towards benefiting higher education, but it could be a pipeline to stopping certain drug cartel interactions.”</p>\n<p>At one point, it was revealed that the entire Senate body lacked some knowledge on the legal status of marijuana in the state, when Off-Campus Senator Nick Onyshko asked the question to all senators of whether marijuana was decriminalized in California and did not receive an accurate response until a fellow senator researched the issue.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus, who opposed the bill, said he was frustrated with his fellow senators’ conduct shortly after the confusion.</p>\n<p>“I am extremely, extremely … disappointed with my Senate tonight,” Theus said. “People in this room don’t even know what the current rates are for a misdemeanor or what the actual revenue’s going to bring in … I think we need to bring that back to the Senate, with all of us being educated on the issues of the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she agreed with Theus regarding the Senate’s actions, and added her own personal sentiment.</p>\n<p>“I’m pissed,” MacLachlan said. “I feel very personally offended.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Student Commission on Racial Equality co-chair Hani Tajsar gave a presentation to the Senate regarding the Facing Race Conference that will be held at the SRB on Feb. 22nd. The event seeks to educate students on issues that affect students of color, and anyone who attends will receive a free S.C.O.R.E. t-shirt and free tacos.</p>\n<p>Tajsar also advocated student action that would continue and improve efforts to recruit and help undocumented and low-income students graduate at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The recruitment and retention rate for undocumented students and low-income students in general, is something that I’m ashamed of … and we should all push for a better system,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation on the controversial proposal for a new development in Isla Vista, which would be located at the current site of the bar Dublin’s at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar. The four-story building, called The Nest has received much criticism from students, according to Moore, which is why he plans to work against the project.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, I’m representing student opinions,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed during the meeting included the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert to be held on Mar. 6, as well as updates from Erick Lankey about promoting food insecurity awareness through the A.S. Food Bank, a progress report on the petition being distributed by the UCen S.U.R.F. initiative and updates on a leadership conference hosted by the Office of Student Life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Senator Amir Khazaieli led the opposition, while in fact multiple senators opposed the bill. In addition, it was wrongly stated that Senator Montana MacLachlan disagreed with Senator Andre Theus when in fact she agreed with his frustration with the Senate. The article has been updated to incorporate these corrections.</em>]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/","id":3041,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3040,3039,3038],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S. Prepares for Election Season, Members Hold Informal Info Sessions","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students elections are starting up already, with political parties beginning launching their online campaigning on Sunday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students elections are starting up already, with political parties beginning launching their online campaigning on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the campaign marks the initial activities of current members of the Democratic Process Party (DPP) and Open People’s Party (OPP), as they actively seek out potential student candidates and any other students who may choose to run with other parties or even independently. Later this month, parties are hosting informational sessions designed to educate students on A.S. and the elections process, which differs for both parties. OPP selects candidates for their slate through an interviewing process, while DPP hosts primaries. Next week, parties and independents will be permitted to begin ‘active recruiting,’ which includes advertising party platforms, hosting public events and making selections for candidates. Elections will be held during week four of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Elections Chair Claire Fox, students will soon begin submitting declarations of candidacy, which is when independents and slated party members announce their plans to run and attend a mandatory meeting on the elections process and associated regulations.</p>\n<p>According to Fox, independent candidates have had success in the past and running as an independent is a “good option” for students, citing current A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s election to the office of senator as an independent candidate two years ago.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Navkiran Kaur said the process for building slates is different for each party and noted that while DPP’s primary process is slower, it allows for greater student input into the selection of A.S. officers and representatives.</p>\n<p>“I believe the process for determining slates is different between the parties because each party has different values. DP Party was really created to challenge the status quo of Associated Students and allow for an open, democratic process,” Kaur said in an email. “We really believe that Associated Students should truly be associated with the students and as such, we feel the primary allows students to be directly involved. It also allows students to nominate exactly who they would like to see in office.”</p>\n<p>According to OPP senator Ali Guthy, OPP candidates are selected using an interviewing process, one which Guthy said allows party members more “one-on-one” time with candidates, allowing them to better assess students’ leadership abilities and skill sets.</p>\n<p>“OPP uses an interview process because we like to give candidates more personable, one-on-one time discuss themselves and their viewpoints; however, I believe that both processes are equally valid for creating slates,” Guthy said in an email. “That’s what is great about a two-party system – such different processes can be used, and both have been successful.”</p>\n<p>Active campaigning occurs during weeks three and four of spring quarter, with general elections held during week four on GOLD. Those seeking office will have the chance to hold tables, pass out flyers and meet with students who have questions for them on who they are and what they want to do if elected.</p>\n<p>DPP will host informational sessions Feb. 18 at the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, Feb. 20 at the Loma Pelona Center and the Gibraltar Center in Santa Ynez, Feb. 24 at the MCC Theatre and Feb. 26 at the San Miguel Formal Lounge and the Santa Catalina Fiesta Room. There will be a last-minute info session on Feb. 27 in Girvetz, right before the DP Party primary. The most important date for DPP is the primary election, occurring Feb. 27 at Girvetz 1004, where any student can nominate any other student for a spot on the DPP’s spring ballot.</p>\n<p>OPP will be holding three informational sessions for sessions for students on Feb. 18, 19 and 20 at HSSB 1210, at Santa Catalina Espacio II and the San Nicolas Classroom, respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, February 12, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53998\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53998\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/","id":3047,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3046,3045,3044],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New A.S.

He urged the Senate to publicly solicit contributions for logo ideas and then encourage all “A.S. entities to make their opinions known.”</p>\n<p>The logo issue hit close to home for Abboud, as he said all students should be able to be a part of the incredible projects and events of A.S.</p>\n<p>“I believe each and every person in A.S. and even the student body should have had a chance to submit designs and submit their opinion,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>Contreras said that while she understands the president’s rationale, she hopes the matter will be resolved quickly, as the Senate has already devoted ample time to the deliberation.</p>\n<p>“President Abboud said that he wasn’t comfortable with the outreach efforts, and I feel that this was a reasonable argument,” Contreras said. “But the Senate had been deliberating on the logo for weeks and very few people voiced concerns, so it didn’t seem like anyone was openly opposed to the change.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53899\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53899\" data-attachment-id=\"53899\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/new-a-s-logo-is-a-no-go-a-s-president-rejects-design/logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53899\" alt=\"Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.</p></div>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Associated Students of UCSB.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Environmental concerns, particularly coastal conservation efforts, dominated her presentation, as Farr said biodiversity of the coastland contains great value.</p>\n<p>“Because of all the coastline that I have, all the coastal protection issues are of utmost importance,” Farr said. “This particular stretch of coastline has some of the highest biodiversity on the planet.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Santa Barbara County’s efforts to move away from fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy has been a prominent effort that she and members of her office “all take very seriously.”</p>\n<p>“I feel very strongly, as do several of my colleagues, that moving our county and our society toward a more sustainable future, looking at our consumption of fossil fuels and how we transition to more sustainable energy sources is something that’s extremely important, and I think that Santa Barbara County has been a model in many ways of forward thinking on environmental issues,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Farr said she is currently working to put together the I.V. community center, which she believes will be a vital addition to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“It’s not an easy fight, but we’ve come this far and we’re optimistic that it will happen,” Farr said. “Having a community center in I.V. is huge and this is something that’s been going on for a long time. I’d really like to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator Amir Khazaieli reported on the current progress in receiving funding for the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>“We do have money now to continue the improvement that y’all as an association and a student body have requested in the last quarter and a half,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Corey Lau, however, showed skepticism toward the community center, asking Senator Khazaieli to justify the expenditure.</p>\n<p>“I’m still apprehensive of the very existence of the Pardall Center, because as far as I know, I’m not so sure that’s a necessary thing,” Lau said. “I want to hear your argument as to why do we need the Pardall Center.”In response, Khazaieli said the center is designed to address various shortcomings within I.V., such as a lack in a connected sense of community.</p>\n<p>“There’s frankly no community and/ or student presence in I.V. right now, especially from the Association,” Khazaieli said. “Having something on Pardall Road … an area where everyone passes will one, incredibly increase[s] transparency and outreach of our association … and will allow us to reach more people with our events, our tabling, our forums — with everything that we do. So I think that it’s a very valid, very needed space.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s veto of a bill passed by the Senate regarding the implementation of a new logo for A.S. was upheld after a lengthy debate amongst the Senators, delaying any possibility of implementing changes to the existing logo.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed plans for the upcoming Chilla Vista concert, the expected budget of which totals to roughly $17,500. Senators spoke on the goal of putting primarily local bands into focus for the concert and noted that this year’s planned expenditure is lower than last year’s. The unspent funds were instead diverted toward the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included plans to increase lighting on dark streets in I.V., the fumigation of the Thunderdome, hiring of a new A.S. administrative personnel, planned renovations to the UCen under the S.U.R.F. Initiative and the efforts to provide more worm compost bins around campus to reduce food waste.</p>\n<p>Later at the meeting, Lundberg was sworn as Senator to replace Senator Marvin Ramirez, who resigned for personal reasons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53902\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53902\" data-attachment-id=\"53902\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/as_senate_johnclow_02-05-2014-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1391632970\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53902\" alt=\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53902\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/","id":3046,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3045,3044,3043],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President Jonathan Abboud presented his ideas to chairs and co-chairs of A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, or BCCs, after completing a revision of another restructuring plan, which was presented at the last BC4 meeting. In the revised restructuring plan, A.S. would no longer be divided into BCCs, and instead the Association would be divided into Senate Standing Committees, Senate Administrative Committees, Units and lastly, Boards and Commissions. Thus, current groups — or BCCs — would be placed into one of these categories according to their function or issue of focus; for example, the A.S. Bike Committee would be considered a Unit. This new organization of BCCs makes for increased involvement of the A.S. Senate through several different implications and changes — such as one change to the electoral process for selecting BCC chairs.</p>\n<p>Currently, BCCs have primary control over the selection of their leaders: the majority of groups have an internal election and then forward the names of elected officials to the A.S. president and Committee on Committees, which fills out the necessary paper work. The A.S. president gives a ‘rubber stamp’ approval of the decision and Senate ratifies it, but the Senate does not play a major role beyond this brief approval process. In the new restructuring plan, Abboud proposed that members of Senate and the Executive Board be part of the process of selecting the incoming board members of each group. In this process, two members of the group and the outgoing position-holder would remain as voting members. However, many chairs felt that this proposed process would jeopardize their ability to function independently and as best as possible.</p>\n<p>Friday’s presentation, which also included the participation of Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, was generally met with extensive questioning and criticism, as many BCCs were skeptical of its effects on their autonomy.</p>\n<p>Abboud, along with senate Pro-Tempore Ali Guthy, used a PowerPoint presentation to show how they planned to change the structure of Associated Students. Abboud prefaced the discussion with a plea for civility.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been disappointed with how negative things have been,” Abboud said. “Let’s just try to be constructive.”</p>\n<p>While most attending BCC chairs were not enthusiastic about any aspect of the presentation, the most contentious issue was the proposed change to the selection process for chairs and board members.</p>\n<p>Anisha Ahuja of Human Rights Board said she did not “understand how cutting the amount of voting members” would be beneficial to the selection process.</p>\n<p>According to Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a sexual assault awareness group — Kelty Kauffman, her organization’s mission is to create a safe space for sexual assault survivors; thus, it is important that the selection committee be well versed in the field. With the current process, Kauffman said the group is able to follow this mission and she rejected the idea that such a selection process may result in unfair exclusivity.</p>\n<p>“Take Back the Night is such a sensitive space and it is considered a safe space for survivors … it’s not so much a cliquey thing it’s about choosing people who are sensitive to the issues at hand,” Kauffman said. “I personally think that there are people in the past who have been involved who have not been sensitive to the issues at hand. Picking people who are heavily involved … is not being cliquey.”</p>\n<p>Several members of Program Board were present at the meeting to voice their concerns about the restructuring plan. One member said he felt creating a uniform process for appointments of new board members was inherently ineffective because “BCCs operate at different levels and operate in different ways.”</p>\n<p>Abboud defended the inclusion of senators in appointments, as a way of instituting “checks and balances” and for senators to be more informed of the process, so that when it came time to approve the appointments in Senate, they would know what they were approving.</p>\n<p>“They have to be present so they know what’s going on [and] they’re not making uninformed votes,” Abboud said. “What I’ve seen for four years in A.S. is every time appointments go up … they kind of just pass … what if there’s a problem?”</p>\n<p>Kyle Trager, general manager of KCSB — which would be exempt from the addition of senators in the selection process, as KCSB is an entity of the press — still took issue with the need for a change in the selection process.</p>\n<p>“Should it not be the job of the president and the non-student staff of A.S., who have an institutional memory, to really push the senators to be proactive?” Trager asked Abboud and Guthy.</p>\n<p>Abboud responded that he has “no authority over the Senate.”</p>\n<p>Abboud and Guthy eventually agreed to scrap the idea of the selection process and take the concerns of the chairs into consideration; however, many were still unsatisfied with the restructure as a whole. Hani Tajsar, of Student Commission on Racial Equality, said he felt Abboud was “trying to fix imaginary problems,” and Mohsin Mirza of Student Lobby said “a one-size-fits-all solution might not be the best idea.”</p>\n<p>How, Guthy said that grouping BCC according to the new categories outlined will make for a more efficient and fair process that does not infringe on any organization’s individual autonomy.</p>\n<p>“Nothing about the restructure will change the way that these groups function,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Abboud and Guthy plan to revise the restructure plan once again and bring it back for yet another discussion.</p>\n<p>In addition to the restructuring plan, BCCs discussed a bill recently passed at A.S. Senate regarding food budgets, presented on-going projects and engaged in a question-and-answer with Vice Chancellor Michael Young.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the meeting about his opinion of A.S. as a whole, Vice Chancellor Young said no one could better represent and advocate the needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“Even though people like me truly do care about you — I work for your best interests — in many ways, you are the best protectors of your interests,” Young said. “I can’t speak for students … the vast majority of the presidents that I’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to work with have done just that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Monday, February 3, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53842\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53842\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/","id":3038,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3037,3036,3035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recent Food Bill Dominates A.S.

Senators Andrew Neiman and Jimmy Villarreal authored the bill in order to combat “excessive expenditures on food at meetings,” and stipulated that groups will only be able to spend money on food for events or programs, quarterly banquets and meetings with attendance exceeding 75 people.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur, who sat on the senate last year, was the first student to present at public forum in opposition to the bill. According to Kaur, restricting food budgets will hurt low-income students who depend on free food from the organizations.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students, with their meetings and classes and all the things that they do, don’t even have time for meals and I think it’s the least A.S. can do with their own student fees to provide a couple of snacks for students during meetings,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>While saying it is “really inappropriate” to limit food, particularly for low-income students, Kaur called the bill “classist” and said it “definitely screwed over a lot of students who depend on these meals.” She also brought up the question of whether or not the bill would affect the A.S. Food Bank, whose specific goal is to provide food for those who cannot afford it otherwise.</p>\n<p>Several members of A.S. Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) also came to public forum in order to contest the bill. One member discussed the bi-quarterly dinner that C.A.B. provides for children of UCSB students, saying they wondered if the organization would still be able to provide it with the restriction. PR Coordinator Kari Newman said 75 to 90 percent of new members come to meetings for the food, and that C.A.B. even uses the hook “great food, great friends” while tabling to attract participation.</p>\n<p>Co-chair Kaitlyn Christianson, who also sat on the senate last year, echoed the idea that food was a main attraction for participation at meetings. She said although students may initially come for the food, they oftentimes find opportunities for community involvement and actually take part in campus organizations. Additionally, Christianson made the argument that since C.A.B. uses the Isla Vista Food Co-op for food, the money they spend goes back towards the community.</p>\n<p>Senators did not devote much time to discussing the food bill, however they did establish an ad hoc committee to look into the concerns that were presented at public forum. Senator Arezu Hashemi said she acknowledged the necessity of discussing the bill.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is a good discussion to have,” Hashemi said. “If we want to talk about it on our own, I think that we should make an ad hoc for it — that way the BCCs can get involved.”</p>\n<p>During the Bills and Resolutions portion of the meeting, senators passed changes to the A.S. Elections code. Last year, changes to elections code consumed the senate for weeks, resulting in meetings that lasted 10 to 12 hours, during which senators debated, voted, were vetoed by the A.S. President and then voted to overturn the presidential veto. This year, elections code passed by consent, meaning that not a single senator objected to the changes.</p>\n<p>The most significant changes to the elections code include allowing independent candidates to spend an additional $100 on their campaigns as compared with last year, and extending the recruitment period for elections from two weeks to three weeks. Otherwise, the code remains relatively unchanged.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Executive Officers delivered reports during which External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate reported on the progress being made towards establishing more online courses, and Senators passed a bill establishing an official A.S. logo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/","id":3040,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3039,3038,3037],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It also includes several exceptions, such as special events.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the authors of the bill hope to discourage extravagant consumption of expensive food at board, committee and commission meetings, as they feel that money could be better spent fulfilling that group’s purpose.</p>\n<p>Issues surrounding the measure’s passage included accusations of classism, worries that certain groups may not be able to carry out specific functions that revolve around food and arguments that food at meetings is a primary method of attracting new members.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur said she feels the bill alienates many low-income students who depend on meals provided by A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Christianson, co-chair of the Community Affairs Board, asserted that free food at meetings was a key factor in her choice to become involved in local affairs and warned that C.A.B. would not be able to carry out some of its key missions, such as providing food for the homeless, with such a restricted budget.</p>\n<p>As of press time, senators had not yet discussed the issue.

Beginning with a presentation about how students can figure out how to effectively spend money on a budget, the presentation later gave a detailed look at how credit works.</p>\n<p>According to Raygoza, budgeting is an essential skill everyone, especially students, should know, particularly in light of numerous expenses such as “paying for books next quarter, or going on vacation” and “traveling abroad” in the midst of rising tuition costs and other strains on student finances.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has dreams and goals, and everyone can achieve them,” Raygoza said. “A good way to start planning towards your goals is to create a financial spending plan.”</p>\n<p>However, while having a spending plan is important, Raygoza noted that even more important than sticking to a plan is to defer from overspending, which can be difficult amidst what he said is the plethora of purchasable temptations in today’s consumer culture.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of choices in how we spend our money,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>While saying that spending money on entertainment can be important to one’s well-being, Raygoza said it is essential to determine how much can be allocated to certain expenses. To do this, Raygoza said students should keep a spending diary for a month and reconsider what classifies as ‘needs’ and ‘wants.’ He also recommended developing cost-cutting habits, such as using public transportation, attending free events, volunteering, brewing your own coffee and taking advantage of student discounts.</p>\n<p>“Ballin’ on a Budget” presenters also discussed interest and annual percentage rates, the usefulness of credit for emergency purchases and larger expenses, as well as the differences between debit, credit, ATM and stored value cards. Speakers also recommended finding out credit scores through Equifax, Experian, TransUnion and <em>www.annualcreditreport.com.</em></p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Amanda Pheng, who attended the event, said the workshop was useful in terms of bettering her understanding of how to handle personal finances.</p>\n<p>“It is stressful. I have to worry about utilities, gas, groceries and other stuff like that. It’s hard sometimes to figure what I need to spend and what I have money for,” Pheng said. “I think it’s always good to budget yourself a little bit better.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 29, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/","id":3139,"author":{"id":185,"name":"Michael Coronado"},"related":[3138,3137,3136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Food Bank.</p>\n<p>In explaining the California State Budget’s impact on the education system, third-year student Ajinkya Joshi discussed Governor Jerry Brown’s priorities in educational funding and also said tuition costs are expected to remain unchanged in the upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to focus on making a five percent increase in the general fund to schools and higher education,” Joshi said. “Essentially, our tuition won’t be increasing; it will be stable, and the UCs and CSUs are going to be aiming to try to increase innovation and trying to make it so that way more of us graduate at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Joshi said the current problems in higher education are that the UCs have a higher cost structure and higher per student subsidy.</p>\n<p>“Right now the problem is trying to maintain the quality of education while keeping the costs low for the student,” Joshi said.</p>\n<p>Although Joshi’s presentation covered a fairly large quantity of information that would directly impact UCSB students, Senators came close to denying Joshi sufficient time to make the presentation. The vote on granting Joshi his requested 10 minutes of extra time turned out to be a tie until Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet broke it with a vote in favor of the time extension.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke briefly on plans for Deltopia, the annual student-organized event coming up this Spring Quarter, regarding efforts to provide extra police units, Port-a-Potties and access to drinking water during the festivities. Moore said he will advocate for a similar system established during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is an expanded version of what we did for Halloween,” Moore said. “We’ll have a hydration station and some sort of safety effort as well.”</p>\n<p>Chair of A.S. Food Bank and third-year economics and accounting major Erick Lankey reported on a series of upcoming events geared toward enhancing student involvement and knowledge about the Food Bank. According to Lankey, these events include “how to eat on a low budget” tours through the I.V. Food Co-op, an extreme couponing team contest and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program challenge in which participants pledge to live on $31.50 of food for a week in an effort to gain empathy for the challenges faced by individuals living on food stamps.</p>\n<p>The presentation received positive feedback from Off-Campus Senators Andre Taylor and Nick Onyshko. Taylor said he was “very excited” to participate, and Onyshko said he applauds the Food Bank for its growth as an organization.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to say all this stuff sounds amazing, and I’m really impressed with everything you’ve done with this committee,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Bills passed during the meeting included a bill to update Take Back the Night’s legal code as well as another bill that limits the amount of money campus BCCs spend on food per quarter to $500 or less, depending on the size of the particular BCC, as part of an effort to reduce wasteful spending. A bill to establish a new A.S. logo was tabled for another week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/","id":3138,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3137,3136,3135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AS Legislation Seeks to Reassign Responsibilities","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Legislation is in the works to restructure Associated Students and its governing bodies, with plans to create special committees in A.S.

Senate that will be responsible for certain A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions and related areas of interest.</p>\n<p>Changes will include the formation of Senate Committees, small groups of senators which will focus with greater depth on particular issues before recommending legislation for all senators to vote on. Another change includes the formation of Senate Administrative Committees, which will dedicate more time to reading over records of Boards, Committees or Commissions meetings than is possible under the current Senate structure. The third revision of the proposed restructuring will be presented to a gathering of all A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions on Friday, Jan. 31 for discussion.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud said he thinks the proposed are changes necessary, saying they will create a greater sense of accountability amongst campus groups and address the current lack of structure and specialization within A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“The Senate meetings run long,” Abboud said, “Without taking a long time, [the senators] don’t really have the opportunity to take a look at resolutions and bills and fix them and make them better before passing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, there are two fundamental problems with the current organization of A.S., the first of which is an alleged overload of responsibilities for senators. In regard to this first problem, Abboud said organizing senators into committees directly dealing with particular issues will cut down on time spent during meetings.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have Senate committees, much like city council or California legislature, that deal with matters on a smaller basis and then recommend legislation back up to the Senate,” he said.</p>\n<p>The second problem he mentioned was discrepancies in the relationships between BCCs — or Boards, Committees and Commissions — and the rest of A.S.</p>\n<p>“There is no definition between the different kinds of entities in A.S,” Abboud said. “There are unclear relationships between the Senate and the BCCs and the Execs and the BCCs.”</p>\n<p>However, many students involved with these A.S. groups hold concerns about how the new restructuring plan will affect the autonomy of each campus group, as they will now be grouped with other organizations and have an A.S. senator representing their interests at Senate meetings. Chair of the Womyn’s Commission Olivia Jaffe-Pachuilo, a third-year French major, is concerned about the effects the restructuring will have on student input for each organization.</p>\n<p>“It’s the details that concern me,” she said. “I don’t think it’s inherently bad, but when it comes down to the bits and pieces, people need to have their own say about what happens to their own groups.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year sociology and psychology major Ali Guthy, who heads the committee authoring the legislation of the restructure, said the new plan addresses divisions that are currently present in the student government.</p>\n<p>“There’s a disconnect between all the different entities within A.S,” Guthy said. “It doesn’t feel like we’re all under the Association.”</p>\n<p>Such disconnect leads students to misunderstand the role of A.S., according to third-year Andre Theus, off-campus senator and vice-chair of the restructuring committee.</p>\n<p>“Everyone thinks that A.S. is Program Board,” Theus said. “They’re a huge face of A.S., but no one knows that there’s this governmental side so there’s this lack of unity.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, BCCs such A.S. Publications and the A.S. Ticket Office will be grouped together in order to promote greater unity within A.S. under the new structure. She also said the restructuring will not affect the internal workings of any BCC.</p>\n<p>“In no [version of the] restructure, has the internal functioning of a group changed,” she said. “We’re changing how groups communicate between each other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53613\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53613\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/","id":3121,"author":{"id":190,"name":"Leon Freyermuth"},"related":[3120,3119,3118],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The meeting was organized by administrators in the Division of Student Affairs and Associated Students officials, and 35 students — including representatives such as the Interfraternity Council President and A.S. president — will participate. The meeting will be closed off to other students.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students marched from the Student Resource Building to the Faculty Lounge, demanding a public forum with the newly appointed UC president, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security before becoming the new leader of the UC system.</p>\n<p>Napolitano’s appointment, which came in July, has largely received backlash from many students since she is the first UC president to lack a background in education, previously acting as the governor as well as attorney general of Arizona. She has also drawn much criticism from the undocumented immigrant student community since she spearheaded the controversial Secure Communities program during her time as Secretary of Homeland Security. The deportation program seeks out undocumented immigrants using fingerprints by provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the site for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported around two million undocumented immigrants — including non-criminal persons — during Napolitano’s term.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s protest, student held up a giant banner highlighting the “No” in “Napolitano,” students from UCSB’s I.D.E.A.S. — or Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success — as well as other campus organizations, marched past UC Police Department officers and CSOs until finally arriving to the Faculty Lounge, where they were met by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead. After criticizing Napolitano on her implementation of record-breaking deportation programs as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, students asked Yang and Armistead if there could be a public forum allowing more students to speak than the few “student leaders” selected by administrators.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. member and second-year student Abigail Salazar said many undocumented students on campus have been directly affected by Napolitano’s deportation programs, herself included.</p>\n<p>“With all due respect, this is a person who has invaded my home, who has destroyed my family and I wasn’t even invited [to the meeting],” Salazar said. “I want to direct a lot of feelings that I have towards her. I have that right.”</p>\n<p>Salazar also said administration’s decision to hold a private meeting instead of a public forum with Napolitano further insulted the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“I command you, Chancellor Yang, to hold a public forum,” Salazar said. “We’re not going anywhere … we will not stand by this any longer. Do you understand us? With all respect, do you understand us?”</p>\n<p>In response to student demands, Armistead said Napolitano would leave right after tomorrow morning’s private meeting and that there was thus “not enough time for a public forum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that everybody who was picked is happy to have an open forum,” Armistead said. “They actually want to have a dialogue, and the concern is — that this happens within the public forum, then nothing can happen and you can’t have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Attendees of tomorrow’s meeting include A.S. executive officials, leaders of campus organizations such as Human Rights Board, I.D.E.A.S. and S.C.O.R.E., or Student Commission on Racial Equality, as well as members of Greek life. However, some of the students invited are not currently the head of any campus group, according to Mario Vasquez, a member of Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Chicano Studies professor Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who joined students in protesting today, said he has taught many students who have dealt with deportation on a personal level. He said student demonstrations should push Napolitano to support the undocumented student community and advocate for immigration policy reform.</p>\n<p>“She could apologize for what she did, and she could put pressure on the Obama administration to stop what it’s doing,” Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said. “It’s nearly deported two million people, which is more people combined than any other in U.S. history.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano has also expressed support for the DREAM Act and undocumented students, and she recently devoted $5 million in UC funding to financial aid and special counseling for undocumented UC students, according to a UC Office of the President press release.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Norma Orozco expressed opposition to the appointment of Napolitano both because of her experience in the Department of Homeland Security and her lack of professional academic experience.</p>\n<p>“This is the president of our university. This is the person that is supposed to make the most critical decisions for universities, such as where our funding goes and where our funding comes from,” Orozco said. “She was in charge of increasing the budgets for our military … that’s not what a university’s about.”</p>\n<p>According to Armbruster-Sandoval, Napolitano should respond to student protest and demand for a public forum if she wants to save face as the rightful president of the UC.</p>\n<p>“So the idea is to say, ‘Hey we’re not happy with this, listen to us,’” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “Apologize, do something, show some contrition, show that you’re a human being, that you have some heart, basically, because you’ve broken our hearts.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"500598246\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"53199\"><img data-attachment-id=\"53201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/protesters-express-outrage-over-napolitanos-exclusive-meeting-with-ucsb-student-leaders/napolitano-protest-johnclow_11-21-2013-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1385052985\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-53201\" alt=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Pardall Center — a center at 6550 Pardall that will be funded by student money and will be open to A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>So far, student officials have not extensively publicized the opening of the space to the general UCSB community, although the center will be entirely funded by student fees. The student government also discussed student support for UC workers, bicycle and skateboard safety and IGNITE, a program that stands for “Invest in Graduations, Not Incarceration. Transform Education.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting Associate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones introduced recently hired staff member for the A.S. Pardall Center Jeanette Lyden, who will be staffing the first floor of the building from noon to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday for the next several months. He said Lyden will be there to “to provide a more consistent presence,” inviting students in A.S. organizations — known as Boards, Committees or Commissions, or BCCs — to stop by and utilize the space.</p>\n<p>Rent for the space costs $5,000 per month and is currently open to A.S. students and members of BCCs. No concrete plan for funding has been formed, although the center will be paid by student fees regardless. Senator Amir Khazaieli has been working closely with an Ad-Hoc committee to search for which groups will contribute funds to the center over the next two years.</p>\n<p>Jones encouraged students to “utilize and hang out in the space” and to continue to visualize what the space will be used for, recalling a recent instance by which the space was used.</p>\n<p>“Just last night, CAB helped to co-sponsor the event with a frat or sorority or another org … where they had a carnival for youth in Isla Vista, and it was packed,” Jones said. “They had game stations set up all throughout the first floor, food, popcorn, games, it was great.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, student officials also spoke about the UC workers’ strike earlier in the day, which drew hundreds of participants campus wide.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano spoke on behalf of UC service and patient care workers, highlighting the economic discrepancy between campus workers’ wages and wages of the national average. According to Soriano, university employees deserve better wages and pension pay than they are currently receiving.</p>\n<p>“Because our employees make so little money, our employees qualify for many public benefits, including MediCal, food stamps, housing subsidies and childcare subsidies,” Soriano said. <b></b></p>\n<p>In addition, a resolution in support of A.S. Bike Awareness Week — concerning pedestrian, skateboard and bicycle safety — was tabled. With a $90,000 budget, A.S. Bike Committee is currently looking outward for more funding assistance for their bike safety campaign causing Senators to argue over their request for more funding for items such as American Apparel t-shirts.</p>\n<p>IGNITE — or “Invest in Graduation, Not Incarceration. Transform Education” — discussed decreased funding for UC education in relation to increased funding for incarcerations. IGNITE is working to reverse issues facing UC students by passing three bills that aim to reprioritize education over prison spending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, November 21, 2013’s print version of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/","id":3068,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3067,3066,3065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Attend Conference at UCLA Despite Funding Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB students attended a three-day-long “Students of Color Conference” at UCLA, after students planning the trip struggled to attain funding when some student government officials said money was b...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB students attended a three-day-long “Students of Color Conference” at UCLA, after students planning the trip struggled to attain funding when some student government officials said money was being allocated unfairly.</p>\n<p>The Students of Color Conference (SOCC) is an annual UCSA event in which students are able to host workshops, listen to speakers and discuss ideas with their peers at other UC campuses. The UCSB Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) sent a delegation of students to the conference — led by Hani Tajsar, a fourth-year Middle Eastern studies major, and Navkiran Kaur, a third-year sociology and Black studies double major. The trip received $7,000 from Associated Students Finance Board for attendees to go to the event, but then struggled to hold onto the funding when other A.S. officials questioned how S.C.O.R.E. was selecting which attendees were permitted to go.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, S.C.O.R.E. asked elected A.S. officials to pay from their allocated budgets to attend the event. S.C.O.R.E. received too many applicants than could be accommodated so the organization asked A.S. officials to pay since they have access to funding that is not available to other students, Kaur said.</p>\n<p>“We wanted elected officials to pay because that way we would have been able to take more first- and second-year students who wouldn’t have had the means to go, otherwise, on the trip with us,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, A.S. Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo said the blocked funding for the delegation was based on discrimination.</p>\n<p>“The Attorney General said that S.C.O.R.E. was discriminating against people in elected positions by making them use their funds to pay for the conference, but the Finance Board ended up disregarding that,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, Finance Board asked Senate to make a final decision or come to a compromise. In response, the students came to a compromise by adding A.S. Senators to the waiting list for the delegation and giving some Senate funding to those who did not get off the waiting list. Abboud, Maghsoodloo and another A.S. official attended the conference using funds from the A.S. Office of the President.</p>\n<p>Maghsoodloo commented on the negotiation in an email, stating Finance Board “broke financial policy with their selection process, so there was a compromise resolution to erase those harms caused by the exclusion of all elected officials from the conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Abboud conceded that S.C.O.R.E. was justified in asking elected A.S. officials to use other funds, but expressed discontent with the fact that S.C.O.R.E. made this request after applications were already submitted.</p>\n<p>“It was retroactive. It was after the applications were submitted,” Abboud said. “I feel like if they had been more proactive and said, ‘Hey, Senate, we’d really appreciate if you paid for whoever applied from Senate,’ that would have been the best way to go about it.”</p>\n<p>Apart from funding issues and in regards to the conference as a whole, Kaur said the event was necessary for students who did not feel comfortable expressing their voice in a normal campus setting.</p>\n<p>“At school, oftentimes, there is no space to express yourself,” Kaur said. “At the conference, students were empowered to share their ideas and share whatever was on their minds.”</p>\n<p>As with every annual SOCC conference, UCSA stages some sort of action, protest or rally. This year, UCSA transformed its F.I.R.E. (Fighting Incarceration, Reclaiming Education) campaign into an I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign (Invest in Graduations, Not Incarceration, Transforming Education).</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, a major focus of I.G.N.I.T.E. is to reexamine the way prisons are structured in the United States. She said a large and concerning discrepancy exists between the funding allocated to education and the funding allocated to prisons.</p>\n<p>“In the past 20 years, California has built 22 prisons but only one university,” Kaur said. “Most of the people incarcerated in these prisons are black and brown people. We need to shift our focus so that we can get these people out of prisons and back into school, so they can have a future.”</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, second-year sociology major and a member of S.C.O.R.E. who attended at the conference, echoed Kaur’s statement. He also said a key aspect of SOCC is the workshops and caucuses they hold for attendees. This year’s workshops aimed to highlight the associations between social justice struggles that are otherwise viewed as irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“A major focus in many of the workshops was connecting the struggles of people of color,” Mirza said. “One workshop connected the Philippines to Gaza to Latin America. Another dealt with the issue of decolonizing textbooks.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said the conference allowed students to attack some of the issues they currently face, but in a safe setting.</p>\n<p>“Students of color are often silenced and their issues are tossed aside or completely ignored,” Mirza said. “Going to conferences like this helps the general UCSB community because it can help us address some of the problems we have.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>—Tiana Miller-Leonard contributed to this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Wednesday, November 20, 2013 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/","id":3067,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3066,3065,3064],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":80,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
