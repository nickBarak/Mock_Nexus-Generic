Senate’s statement was posted on the A.S. Senate Facebook page on Nov. 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been three allegations of sexual assault brought against Sigma Pi; the first two were reported by the Nexus on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oct. 24</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while the third was reported by the university through a timely warning sent out on Oct. 28. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura was the one who first brought up the recent allegations to the Senate during the Wednesday night meeting, emphasizing the importance of making survivors of sexual assault aware of the resources available to them through A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate then went into a working group to write a draft of the statement, which was later posted on Facebook alongside a note encouraging attendance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a town hall hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault on Nov. 14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement condemns “unsafe spaces” and “any student organization that perpetuates the harassment and abuse of any person”; it also calls for the UCSB administration to respond to “environments that enable sexual violence.” The statement did not name any particular organization or environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, the Senate added that it believes these allegations are not isolated incidents and are instead “a reflection of a greater culture that allows sexual violence to continue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This harmful culture needs to be addressed and stopped,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President Alli Adam echoed similar points in a statement to the Nexus, stating A.S. “[doesn’t] condone what’s going on in our own community and [has] no problem standing up to fellow community members and confronting this unfortunate culture.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also mentioned that the Senate emphasized the need to demonstrate support rather than simply listing resources for survivors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that [the senators] brought up that I thought was really powerful is they didn’t want to just list resources because students kind of feel like that’s redirecting the issue, but [the senators] all were willing to make themselves available as well. So I thought that was a really unique perspective to take, and I’m proud of that,” Adam said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement released by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) parallels the Senate’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one should have to spend their nights out in fear. It’s on us to take a deep look at the culture that enabled this incident, and correct it,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in the statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kristie Nguyen, board director for the I.V. CSD, the problem doesn’t lie within Greek life as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some social media posts have </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, but with the individual.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to see [people] blaming the Greek community for recreating this culture because this culture has already been prevalent throughout society. It’s a huge epidemic,” Nguyen said in a phone call with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look into it, a lot of people in the Greek community – like fraternities – don’t condone that kind of behavior. It was more of an individual choice to make those disgusting decisions to do that to people. We shouldn’t be blaming anyone but the people who have done what they did.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD’s statement was sent out on Oct. 24 — prior to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB to all students on Oct. 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he was “incredibly frustrated and disgusted” by the alleged crime in the timely warning sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that under all the scrutiny that the university is providing [Sigma Pi] right now, there was another incident, really speaks to the institutional problem, a problem with the culture,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also lists a variety of resources for survivors of sexual assault offered by the I.V. CSD and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just stand by without doing something. While we’re already providing services like our interpersonal violence and sexual education and prevention program along with the survivor resource center, we also just want to continue to make it clear what our values are and how we will support survivors,” I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will believe survivors and we will stand with that.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The GSA also plans to use part of its own budget to finalize said renovations, with the total cost estimated to slightly exceed $100,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Space really is a commodity on this campus,” Sorin said. “We were hoping… to reclaim [the lounge] publicly as ours, to demonstrate to the broader UCSB community that [it] is for grad students. We really don’t have anywhere else on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other renovations, the GSA intends to replace all the furniture in the lounge and patio, Sorin said, adding that accessibility for all students was considered, as the current furniture limits flexibility within the space. She said the intent with the new furniture is to make every student feel comfortable and welcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GSA Lounge will be open 24/7, but students will need to check out a keycard from the GSA to open the locked door, according to Sorin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lounge will also be receiving four egg chairs — spherical chairs with an overhead visor — courtesy of UCSB Health and Wellness, which has a budget set aside for graduate students. The chairs will be placed into a new relaxation room, formerly an infrequently used conference room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sorin, the last renovations to the lounge were made prior to Lubach’s appointment as advisor — over 14 years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The lounge is] a real hodgepodge, we couldn’t tell you where any of it came from,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations began in the middle of August and are planned to be completed by the end of fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just excited to get it finished… really we just want grad students to feel like they have a place on campus where they are welcome constantly anytime, day or night, and that they can get support, even if that’s just kicking back on the couch,” Sorin said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sweeney said that it is highly unlikely that union members would reject the contract, but if they did, the union would need to re-negotiate a contract with the UC. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeney added that the contract will increase researchers’ job security by extending appointment times to at least a year for each researcher. Before the contract, researchers could receive appointments lasting as short as a month, reducing their ability to plan projects effectively, according to Sweeney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC agreed to “longer term appointments, equity and salary scale smoothing adjustments for those lower on the salary scales, [and] strict merit review deadlines” Holbrook said in an email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal was a multi-year agreement that recognizes the significant contributions academic researchers make to UC’s academic mission, and that’s what we’ve achieved,” said Peter Chester, the UC’s executive director of labor relations, in a press release.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the UC now requires “just cause” in order to terminate a researcher in the middle of their appointment, according to Sweeney, meaning that the UC must provide warnings and a fair investigation of a researcher’s conduct before firing a researcher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union was unable to secure comprehensive paid parental leave during the negotiations, but now employees may accrue sick and vacation days in order to use them consecutively as a substitution for parental leave, according to Sweeney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before this contract, you were only able to use those sick days in very limited ways. It had to be either you were sick or a family member was sick. Under the [new] contract, you can use them to take care of a baby,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Paid parental leave increases employee satisfaction, increases retention of women at the university, increases productivity. The costs of it are basically negligible because people end up staying longer. We think it’s really a win-win to expand this.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a joint committee between the union and the university will explore options to fund paid parental leave and create bridge funding, according to Holbrook. Bridge funding is a form of financing meant to cover immediate, short-term concerns until a method for longer-term funding is found. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While ARU and UAW 5810 settled their contracts relatively amicably with the university, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents UC health care and service workers, is striking and will hold a walkout on Nov. 13 due to allegations of violations of state labor laws.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People form[ed] a union because they felt that, as researchers, they could do better work if they had more workplace protections,” Sweeney said. “Better working conditions leads to better research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/","id":1943,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1942,1941,1940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Real Talk Program Returns to Dorms for Second Year","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Real Talk program works toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender.

While the Multicultural Awareness Program appointed coordinators in each residence hall to facilitate discussion programs, the Real Talk program will instead work toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender, rather than keeping the focus on education-based programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duane “Deejay” Johnson, chair of the Real Talk program, explained that the Multicultural Awareness program was created in the 1980s, and in the past few years, staff noticed there was “lack of knowledge” regarding marginalized groups in the older program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, in 2019, people… have access to more knowledge surrounding race, sexuality, etc,” Johnson said. He added that Real Talk took inspiration from other programs such as Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk, a Facebook Watch show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Johnson, the Real Talk program was established as a way for students to comfortably talk about different topics such as “race and [the] social norms of living in this society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to not ignore the educational component of teaching students in the residence halls about multiculturalism, but instead, give students the opportunity to talk about their own experiences, teach each other and create open dialogues surrounding different topics that affect all of our everyday lives,” James Forrester, a student leadership program advisor, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrester views the Real Talk program as a chance for students to hold meaningful conversations that spark new perspectives “using key communication skills.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Assistant Resident Directors supervise each residence hall’s individual program and each have their own goals for it, according to Felipe Recinos Quant, Manzanita Village’s assistant resident director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My main goal is for RTs to become bigger in attendance. Of course, quality over quantity but I would love for discussions about social justice to continue to grow,” Recinos Quant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want there to continue to be a safe space available for the Manzi community to have discussions on social justice issues that are at times somewhat taboo to talk about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first year of the Real Talk program was focused on tackling the “-isms” — such as racism, sexism and ableism, according to Johnson. But Johnson found that the program still felt constricting —  the point was for the conversations to be free-flowing. Now, facilitators are trained not to give their personal opinions, but instead to guide conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Real Talk has a motto: they do the before, during and the continuing. Before consists of checking themselves — are they able to deliver this, are they able to educate on this topic, do they hold personal biases?” Johnson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the session [the facilitators] set ground rules and look for signs in the audience of anger, discomfort, frustration.

The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">panel was made up of leaders from Food and Water Action, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mixteco/Indígena Community Organizing Project (MICOP), the Community Environmental Council (CEC) and Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the groups are members of the C3JN and are specialists on specific local economic and social climate concerns; C3JN</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a group that has been working together for two years to achieve more transactional climate action. Ana Rosa Rizo-Centino, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senior Central Coast organizer for Food and Water Action, said that C3JN is a blueprint for what other areas can be doing to best address climate challenges. It focuses on how whole community involvement produces the most effective results. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making presentations about their organizations, community climate leaders opened up the floor to take questions from the audience and discuss community climate concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening centered around the importance of community collaboration to achieve a Green New Deal suited to the Central Coast; Vanessa Terán, policy and communications associate for MICOP, emphasized that “it’s going to take all of us to build the movement that we want to see and the change we want to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent Montecito mudslides and Thomas Fire, which devastated areas of Santa Barbara County, were big topics of discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These events put our work in greater perspective,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigrid Wright, the CEO and executive director for the CEC said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referencing working on climate policies in the face of natural disasters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Pellow, director of the environmental studies department at UCSB, said the Green New Deal will look different for various solutions depending on areas’ geographic and economic dynamics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Santa Barbara area, this involves reducing emissions, creating sustainable local jobs and revolutionizing transportation systems, according to Pellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wright added that the close proximity of Santa Barbara’s highways and train systems to the ocean makes them particularly vulnerable to climate effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of our critical infrastructure is at risk,” Wright said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron Gray, transportation and climate manager for the CEC, further explained that “40% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation systems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that greenhouse gas emissions need to be decreased in order to significantly reduce climate change; in the Santa Barbara area, this would mean changing the number of electric cars, moving jobs closer to where people live and improving public transportation to reduce congestion along Highway 101.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students were curious about how they could take action themselves. Representatives from the student group, Eco Vista, asked for hands-on suggestions on how to make Isla Vista more green. Alice O’Connor, director of the Blum Center, recommended community gardens and locally sourced goods as a place to start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel also emphasized the need for the Green New Deal to be intersectional and inclusive of all groups, regardless of income or race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Climate justice requires rebirth of institutions which have been historically and to this day predominantly white,” Maricela Morales, executive director of CAUSE, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruby Layman, a first-year environmental studies major at UCSB, attended the forum to get more involved in local sustainability initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to see as much environmental action as possible so I figured going to forums and getting involved is the best way to do that,” Layman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people closest to the problems are closest to the solutions,” Terán added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

<em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event’s organizers were careful to emphasize that Thursday’s gathering was not a protest but instead a demonstration to support survivors and provide students with information about the resources at their disposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to clarify that this is not a protest. We are not yelling out anything or being aggressive. This is a demonstration to SUPPORT and STAND with survivors,” the organizers wrote Wednesday night on the Intersectional Feminists’ </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RWA8ZJUbB/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary event organizers, Eli Diaz, Alana Ulloa and Kyremina Youssef, began planning the event on Monday, starting with two organizations and eventually growing to 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They originally planned to publish a list of demands for the university on Thursday morning that students would have been able to sign on to support at the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In place of a list of demands, the organizers instead presented attendees with a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm7FZrdK3bFI_U12QGWji2mt1M6z6JK5dWMR9wMv1uyo_J6A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that asked people their name and affiliation with UCSB or Isla Vista. The form also prompted them to answer the question, “What demands would you like to see be enacted on campus and in Isla Vista?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really want to make sure these demands are representative of what the student collective wants,” Ulloa said, adding that they would most likely release the demands in about a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of Thursday’s demonstration, the petition had received over 800 signatures, according to Diaz, who said they “don’t plan on closing [the petition] off anytime soon.” Despite not having a list of demands prepared at the Thursday protest, Diaz found “it’s better to get the input from the wider student populace before we finalize that list.”</span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because of the volume of feedback that we’ve gotten, especially from the Google Form, we definitely want to take an appropriate amount of time to really comb through that and really take the time to incorporate that into whatever list gets made,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens of students, some affiliated with participating organizations and some on their own, held up signs and talked to those walking through the Arbor about signing the petition through a QR code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For second-year student Hannah Ezell, the decision to sign the petition was a simple one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just important for everyone to participate … it’s yes or no; it’s a pretty clear answer of what needs to be happening, so I did it without question,” Ezell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If getting involved in an organization isn’t for you, just talk to your friends about it and learn about what other people’s takes are on it. The more you know, I think the more you can grow and the more you can teach other people from what you have learned.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year economics major Devin Dohrmann also decided to join in solidarity, saying that he believed a misogynistic society is at fault for the recent events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more male voices which you have, I feel, the more likely other men are to listen to you, because the people who are committing these rapes are already being conditioned by a really misogynistic society to not listen to women,” Dohrmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organizers also emphasized the importance of creating an activist coalition through the demonstration. Over 15 organizations signed up to collaborate with Intersectional Feminists, including campus resources such as Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) and student-led groups like Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For SASA, it was important to use the demonstration as a way to share resources that are available to survivors to help them navigate what they can do after being sexually assaulted, according to Francisco Trejo, a fourth-year biology major manning SASA’s table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Intersectional Feminists has taken the lead on putting together the demands, SASA has been figuring out “how much is actually feasible for the administration to implement,” Trejo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks ago, SASA met with several administrators to discuss the university’s response to the latest allegations of sexual assault, according to Trejo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re always in the process of figuring out what more we can ask of [the university] to do for the student body and how we can more effectively communicate with them,” he added. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90929\" style=\"width: 1830px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA is also partnering with C.A.R.E. to create a new prevention education curriculum, according to C.A.R.E.’s Assistant Director of Prevention Education Sven Rundman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with SASA to develop curriculum that we’re launching this year for all campus organizations … [and] also for Greek life as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood Generation Action, an on-campus organization that functions as a political arm of Planned Parenthood, was another student group that set up a table at Thursday’s demonstration with the intention of providing students with information about resources in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a survivor, I want to show the resources that helped me at Planned Parenthood when I needed that support,” said Megan Ashley, third-year vocal performance major who represented Planned Parenthood Generation Action at Thursday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor for Santa Barbara County and a representative of Isla Vista and UCSB, was originally only on campus to meet with Planned Parenthood Generation Action when she learned about the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here because I want to stand with survivors and highlight the importance of this issue,” Hartmann said. “This is unacceptable, and we really need to change people’s minds about what it means to be a man in our society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also applauded quick organization of the demonstration by Diaz, Ulloa and Youssef, and the large coalition of campus organizations that had come together in just a few days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This really speaks to one, the organizational abilities of those who put this together and two, how serious everyone takes [allegations of sexual assault] on campus,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said she was also excited by the fact that the petition in circulation wasn’t just a set of demands, but an invitation for students to provide their input on what changes needed to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the beginning of a discussion to pull together ideas,” she said. “I want to be part of the discussion, and I want to be part of the answer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt ‘19, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, noted that it seemed as if the university was back where it was several years ago, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sit-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office with a list of demands to reform the way the university addressed sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The frustration is palpable, to still be here three years later,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In between now and then, we’ve had the #MeToo movement, which has brought a lot of issues of sexual violence and harassment into the national context,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echoing Hartmann’s points, Brandt applauded the efforts of the students who put together the demonstration and the efforts of those who have pushed for conversations about addressing sexual violence on campus and in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that what’s really important is that students are the ones who are leading this movement,” he said. “Students have come together and said ‘enough is enough’ before, and I think that’s what needs to happen again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the local politicians present at Thursday’s demonstration, several university administrators attended the event to show their support, including Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, and Katya Armistead, dean of student life, who co-signed an email sent to all UCSB students Wednesday night regarding the recent sexual assaults and university communications with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took us a long time to get that statement out, and quite honestly, that hurts my heart,” Armistead said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the concerns she has heard from students were that the university hadn’t been communicating enough with students and that the administrators were planning on continuing to send emails to students explaining the situation and what the university was doing in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Affairs administration will be holding a town hall next Wednesday, Nov. 6, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef emphasized that she hopes the conversation around sexual assault will continue with administrators after the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is something we want to keep in discussion with UC admin and just keeping it in discussion from now on. This is just the start, and we want to keep doing things as well,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the demonstration can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/in-photos-protect-survivors-not-frats-students-hold-demonstration-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-90840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long associated with the hippie and counterculture movements, the widespread availability of psychedelics and other substances in the 1960s attracted the concern of governments worldwide, leading to the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970 and the further stigmatization of psychedelics in American culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ever since psychedelics were criminalized by Nixon around the early ‘70s, it’s been hard to use them in research or therapy,” Emily Gworek, fourth-year biopsychology major and cofounder of UCSB’s Psychedelic Club, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is changing — the conversation and culture around psychedelics is beginning to shift, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past couple of decades … people have been pushing those bureaucratic boundaries and working the drugs through clinical trials,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by UCSB students Gworek, Surya Santhanam and Kristel Kerrigan, Psychedelic Club of UCSB aims to provide a space on campus to facilitate honest discussions about psychedelics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first branch of Psychedelic Club was established at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2014. Psychedelic Club’s overarching mission is to “increase mainstream cultural awareness and acceptance of psychedelics,” according to a statement from its </span><a href=\"https://www.psychedeliclub.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the very basic level, we want to be a safe space for people to come and talk about whatever interest they have in it. Bad or positive experiences, life-changing experiences. We want them to be able to connect with people about [psychedelics] and learn,” Kerrigan, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us are biopsychology majors; we know how [psychedelics] work on your brain and how it affects your body. We want to actually inform people on that and actually talk about research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelic Club of UCSB is the first branch of Psychedelic Club in California and the 10th in the nation, with other branches located in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine, according to its website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek first became aware of Psychedelic Club while browsing research on the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (M.A.P.S.) website, stumbling upon a link to the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then reached out to Clayton Ickes, the vice president of Psychedelic Club at CU Boulder, and began discussions to establish a branch of Psychedelic Club at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Gworek was starting to have conversations with other UCSB students surrounding their shared interest in psychedelics research. Over the summer, Gworek communicated with Santhanam over text, although they didn’t meet in person until the beginning of this school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were intrigued by historical research into psychedelics, as well as the growing acceptance of psychedelics in present-day psychological research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] see all this valid research — although most of it was done in the ‘60s before the giant ban on drugs,” Santhanam, a third-year psychological and brain sciences major, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were these incredible findings with people with terminal illnesses. Psychedelics had this capacity to help people accept death or change their attitudes toward death, which I think is phenomenal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research also indicated that psychedelics were effective in managing disorders like anxiety and depression and even had a degree of effectiveness when other medications weren’t working, according to Santhanam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have institutions began to address the subject of psychedelics on a large scale, Gworek said. In September, Johns Hopkins University opened a center for psychedelic research: The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Funded with $17 million from private donors, it is the first research institution of its kind in the United States and the largest of its kind in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“John Hopkins has opened their research center for psychedelics, which is amazing. I would love to be a part of that and get more labs open to that, although definitely something that needs to happen now is that [psychedelics research] needs to be more structured and have more direction,” Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santhanam, Gworek and Kerrigan were also interested in how the everyday person could benefit from psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics can allow even your average person to get new perspectives on life and it allows people to be really introspective and remind you how important it is to be present and intentional with the things that you do,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a psychedelic is metabolizing the serotonin receptor, it seems to fire much faster and also can make parts of your brain interact that don’t normally communicate,” Santhanam added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santhanam, psychedelics allow one to reexamine aspects of their life in manners which are difficult to perform without psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek, Santhanam and Kerrigan intend to use the club as a platform to inform people of the benefits and drawbacks to using psychedelics, as well as dispel common misconceptions regarding psychedelics and how they compare to other drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics are not the go-to drugs for most people. You’d be surprised by how many people may have heard about it but don’t even know what a psychedelic is,” Santhanam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, Psychedelic Club would like to bring speakers and advocacy organizations to campus, such as EntheoMedicine, as well as host risk management events in the style of The Zendo Project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EntheoMedicine people are the people that kind of guide you through your trip and they host events in other countries where it’s legal, and they’re kind of guides when you’re on it. They said they’d be interested, and that they really want to talk to young people, Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zendo Project is a program associated with M.A.P.S., which provides psychedelic harm reduction to those at festivals, concerts and other events where psychedelic substances may be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re at a festival and you’re using psychedelics and things get weird and you’re uncomfortable and you’re anxious and you’re overwhelmed because you’re surrounded by thousands of people and pounding music, they provide a safe space where you can go,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have therapists who are trained to deal with people having a difficult psychedelic experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek plans to host a psychedelic harm reduction event in the same vein to teach people about risk management, how to best navigate bad trips and, beyond that, what to learn from difficult trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If something goes wrong like that, that’s an anxiety that a lot of people have about using psychedelics. It’d be nice to educate people on how to best handle those kinds of situations,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But above all else, the priority of Psychedelic Club is to start the conversation about psychedelic use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping the club will just be a place where people who are interested in psychedelics or psychedelic research or just the psychedelic experience in general … can just kind of congregate and have those discussions,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

[The] day of, we all showed up, we were all ready … But the only thing is not a lot of kids showed up,” Ornelas said. “Three kids showed up, which is really unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tradition of trick-or-treating is often lost on those residing in Isla Vista, especially for the local youth in search of bite-sized fun. Events like Haunt the Loop help provide an opportunity to engage in a community often tailored to a much different demographic. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/islavistacdpcalifornia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last census</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2010, less than three percent of Isla Vista’s 23,096 residents were under the age of 18; within that, less than 0.9 percent were under the age of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like the children around this area don’t really have a normal childhood as other children would have, because they live in a college town,” Joana Gutierrez, a third-year sociology major who volunteered at Haunt the Loop, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re constricted of doing many things, especially during the holidays, because it’s not really safe for them to go out when everybody is going out and getting drunk and partying. So I feel like it’s very important that [we] as students take them out to safely trick-or-treat and show them that we care about them having a childhood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But only a few volunteers got to answer this call. Trick-or-treating was supposed to be over a two hour period from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. last Sunday, with volunteers leading groups of children from one spot to another. The first </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and only </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group to arrive came to the Pardall Center around 3:30 p.m. But around 4 p.m., Ornelas said the volunteer crew began packing up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s drop in numbers took organizers by surprise. Both the planning and the event itself were based entirely off of last year’s report, according to Shannon Sweeney, the EVPLA chief of staff, who put the event together alongside Andy Ruiz, the EVPLA community events coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can never really guess predictability on the kids’ end, just because every year it’s different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what they might be doing that weekend,” Ruiz said. “The businesses are always so amazing at helping out with that, being very cooperative, allowing us to invite people into their business for community betterment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two worked from a report left by former Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) organizer Alex Young, who detailed the process in which organizers hosted the event last year. Like last year, according to Ornelas, the I.V. CSD coordinated with the EVPLA office to advertise the event with posters through I.V. Youth Projects (IVYP) and I.V. Elementary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The youth-oriented nature of the event proved to be one of the biggest challenges in planning and publicizing it, Sweeney said. While most events targeted for students are advertised through Facebook and Instagram, Haunt the Loop’s audience </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children and their parents </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required a different kind of grassroots approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle that, the EVPLA staff brought their posters to the I.V. CSD, who then shared it with IVYP’s Family Resource Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said the planning process was “exactly the same as last year,” and couldn’t deduce why the turnout was significantly lower compared to Haunt the Loop in years past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It could have been any number of things … sometimes events just don’t have a lot of people come to them. It was a great success last year; it was a lot of people. Who knows why people didn’t come this year?” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifteen local businesses in and around the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including Buddha Bowls, Rockfire Grill, Cajé, Amazon and the I.V. Bicycle Boutique </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partnered with the EVPLA office to pitch in with candy distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were on hand to provide candy to participating businesses, but Ornelas said many provided their own and decorated for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plenty of leftover candy to spare, Ornelas also is not sure what caused this year’s small turnout. Hosting the event on Sunday afternoon </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same day as last year’s Haunt the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely isn’t the problem, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz said the Sunday afternoon slot was chosen for safety concerns for children and for volunteers who would be difficult to schedule during the week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with this year’s low attendance in mind, Ornelas is discussing with Sweeney and Ruiz about moving the event closer to Halloween in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas speculates that the areas to the north of I.V. are a more popular option for candy collecting as “a lot of children go trick-or-treating in the community behind FT” and as it is outside of I.V., which may be safer and more receptive to children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working through I.V. CSD and other organizations, Ornelas believes that in the future, the EVPLA office should be more direct in its outreach by keeping more of the workload in-house to draw the most outreach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Haunt the Loop was a learning experience, Ornelas said, in part because the responsibility of hosting the event fell onto new shoulders, and the small showing left most involved scratching their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fliers, pounds of candy and weeks of preparation, when an event doesn’t turn out the way you had it envisioned, Ornelas said: “It just sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

However, the office does keep copies of the allegations on file, even if the student isn’t punished following a first infraction, according to the warning emails sent to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never tried to get an ID in the past, but I’m on Free and For Sale and I see the posts all the time and I know it’s a common thing people do,” said a fourth-year anthropology major, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The student posted on the Free and For Sale page looking for an extra ID so their younger sister, who is not a UCSB student, could attend Delirium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting on the Facebook page, a warning email from the Office of Student Conduct appeared in the student’s inbox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t even think about it being an issue because everyone’s been doing it for so long.

However, Board President Spencer Brandt named UCSB, A.S., Santa Barbara City College, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District, the city of Goleta and local businesses as current potential sponsors for the festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the number that we have in front of us with no else at the table with us, I’m not comfortable using our revenue for it, in the full amount,” Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen agreed with Bertrand’s concerns and suggested scaling down the size and cost of the event to gauge the community’s response, and afterward, determine if the festival was a success and warrants a greater investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find out if [the spring festival] is going to be successful, then we can start funding more money. But as of right now, we don’t know the success rate, and we won’t know until it actually happens,” Nguyen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has also shouldered a portion of its festival budget under Operating Expenses but stressed that the Safety and Security portion is “NOT THE PLACE TO CUT” in the budget, as stated in the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been continuously telling people that the reason why we want to do this is not because we want Deltopia to be shut down. It’s because we want to draw people — a certain amount of people, not everyone, but a certain amount of people — away from the [Del Playa] area because that is where the public safety problems are,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to gather community feedback regarding the spring festival, the I.V. CSD will be having a town hall at St. George’s Youth Center tomorrow, Oct. 28, at 6 p.m. with Lucidity representatives present.

id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The reference desk was merged with the services desk. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reference desk, previously 30 feet away from the library’s mountain side entrance, was removed on Sept. 14 and merged with the services desk by the Paseo West entrance; while this may be a new change to the UCSB community, Library </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communications &amp; Marketing Manager Hannah Rael believes that it isn’t an outdated practice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reference desk removals at libraries [have] been a trend for more than a decade,” Rael said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, library reference desks are desks that professional librarians sit at to help direct students to what they are looking to find. But due to internet advances and other technical innovations that allow users to access information in a handful of seconds, libraries have had to rethink the ways in which they make directional and reference information easily accessible to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rebecca Metzger, associate university librarian for research, the merging of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the reference desk and services desk is the culmination of a three year-long planning process involving the strategic review and redesign of the library’s frontline service model. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During those [three] years, we gathered data, held facilitated discussions with reference librarians and staff, introduced an online system for booking reference appointments and experimented with different hours and staffing models,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightspot, a strategy firm dedicated to collaborating with universities and other institutions in order to improve student services based on technological shifts and social changes, was brought in to assist library staff with the redesign to better serve users of the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We worked with [Brightstop] for two months, guided by a steering committee in the library. Two open town halls were held for library staff, and Brightspot led multiple additional focus groups to gain input,” Metzger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metzger explained that the ultimate goal was to provide library visitors with a well-structured experience. Formerly, each desk was managed by a different library department and staff went through distinct training programs. Now that the desks are merged, all desk staff will have the same consistent service training and be able to provide users with answers to whatever questions they may have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to improve the user experience and service consistency. In the past, it wasn’t obvious which desk to start at. Students would sometimes get bounced back and forth between the two desks to get the answers they needed,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as reported by the </span><a href=\"https://www.arl.org/arl-statistics-survey-statistical-trends/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Association of Research Libraries</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there has been an 84% decrease in reference questions within the past twenty years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Metzger, only one-third of the questions asked at the Davidson Library’s reference desk were reference-related questions. By removing librarians from the reference desk, their time is no longer spent addressing basic questions that can instead be answered by trained staff and students at the service desk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this merge allows the library to make more effective use of its resources, Metzger stressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were investing in duplicative staffing by having student assistants and staff on the reference desk and services desk only 30 feet apart at the same time,” Metzger said. “Our data shows us that the same types of questions were being asked at each desk, [and] by streamlining our staffing, we are able to continue to invest in other projects that improve the library.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the services desk now takes on reference-related matters, it still maintains many of its old functions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The services desk continues to be the spot for checking out books, media, course reserves, interlibrary loans, laptops and other materials,” Metzger said. “In fact, you can now also check out calculators, phone chargers, bike locks, board games and frisbees.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Library users are encouraged to submit their feedback via the library’s online s</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/suggestions.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uggestion box</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, said Metzger. Alongside a handful of students submitting feedback saying that they miss the reference desk, library staff have also had to grow accustomed to these changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Library staff are still learning how to provide service in the merged environment so there may be some growing pains, but they are deeply committed to providing quality service to our UCSB community,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the library is currently in a transition period as it has moved on to revamp its service training program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are monitoring how [the training program] is going and are open to making tweaks as we learn more. The truth is that we live in a fast-paced environment where library services have the potential to change regularly based on trends, user behavior and input and data,” Metzger said.</span></p><div

The office plans to put on events throughout the year for mentorship pairings, but the goal for the program is for the pairs to find and share commonalities in their free time as well, Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes a great deal of courage to leave your family and friends behind to pursue their academic aspirations,” Rifkin said. “The Global Ambassador Program tries to ensure that our international students feel welcome and included.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mission of OISS is to “cultivate an inclusive environment which supports international students academically, professionally and personally by providing holistic advising on immigration, employment and cultural matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” according to its website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff and advisors at OISS recognize that international students often have difficulty making friends and can feel uncomfortable sharing their culture, Rifkin said, and added that similar programs have found success at universities like UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to mentor also gives experienced UCSB students the opportunity to gain important skills in an increasingly global world, Rifkin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This holds true with Lauren McKnight, a third-year biochemistry major who was a tour guide for international students over the summer who said she wanted to continue cultivating those relationships during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having grown up in southern California, I’ve always been really familiar with the culture in California and the U.S. By getting to know my mentees and other international students, I get to see a little bit more of their perspective of the environment here,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight added that the Global Ambassador Program not only creates an easier transition for international students but overall increases campus diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Joost, a global ambassador and fourth-year global studies major, said she has cultivated friendships that extend beyond the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also have a great line of communication through [Snapchat] and WhatsApp. We try to meet [up] just to study, or if one of us is just hanging out in IV we try to let the group know that they can join us!” Joost said over email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am hoping to build some great friendships and to learn more about the different cultures within my group,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mentor, Jordan Kaiser, fourth-year global studies major, said she understood the difficulty of trying to cross a cultural barrier from her time studying abroad in Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wished I had a program like this when I was abroad. I often felt confused or lost when I was abroad and had a hard time breaking out of my ‘American bubble,’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rifkin, the program not only benefits international students but also the ambassadors who learn to view the world through a “different cultural lens,” particularly those interested in working in an international field or studying abroad.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As international educators we recognize that global exchange is a two-way street,” Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s domestic students and staff stand to learn just as much as from our international students and scholars as they do from joining our campus community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90627\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90627\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/","id":1955,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[1954,1953,1952],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
