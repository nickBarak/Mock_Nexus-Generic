The workers laid the last segment of pipe on Tuesday evening and are now replacing the ground on top.</p>\n<p>The project faced significant delays due to the large storms as well as sporadic rain events throughout the winter that have led to extremely wet soil that is taking longer than expected to dry.</p>\n<p>The renovation may be further extended to replace a part of the bike path. Though this is not part of the infrastructure project, Foster believes it would be ideal to take advantage of cyclists already being rerouted.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done Herculean efforts to keep construction as minimal with regards to the extent of the work,” Foster said. “That slows us down a little bit, but I think that payoff is important to the students.”</p>\n<p>In order to minimize the project’s impact on students, project managers have extended construction hours as late as 10 p.m. in attempts to finish construction sooner.</p>\n<p>Ray Aronson, associate director of Design &amp; Construction Services, said financing for the infrastructure project comes from the state’s annual budget. Phase 1B, which was done by Tierra Contracting, totalled $6.5 million, while the contract with D-KAL Engineering for phase 1C was $2.3 million.</p>\n<p>According to Michael McGrogan, financial planning analyst, UCSB will not be responsible for payments on the loan, which came from the UC Office of The President. The office will repay the loan through state appropriations.</p>\n<p>Also included in phase 1C is the Lagoon Road stormwater drainage project, which will create a new pipeline to reroute runoff water into the lagoon instead of off the eastern bluffs.</p>\n<p>The project will abandon and cap the existing drainage pipes and remove the sections that extend past the bluffs. This may help prevent bluff erosion, which could potentially affect the new pipeline in 100 years.</p>\n<p>The new pipeline is installed between 30 and 200 feet away from the bluffs’ edge.<br>\nA lagoon hydrology study was prepared in 2008 to analyze the hydrological impact of this project. The study found that this would only moderately increase the lagoon’s water levels and showed there would not be a significant increase in pollutants, since the lagoon already contains high levels of copper, phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>\n<p>The report recommended a bioswale to improve water quality, prompting the San Nicolas Restoration project as part of phase 1A. A bioswale is a landscape technique designed to remove silt and pollution from surface runoff water.</p>\n<p>This may improve water quality in the lagoon by diluting current water with water that does not have the pollution present in previous storm runoff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Local Freebies and Activities This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week, catch the 'zine scene with The Catalyst, desserts with the elderly and more.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday at the I.V.

Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Maryam Rasekh sat in front of a computer in Iran on Jan. 27, rapidly refreshing her computer screen to determine whether she could return to Santa Barbara and complete a graduate degree.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump had issued an executive order hours earlier banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. As news began spreading throughout the affected countries, Rasekh learned firsthand that she was one of three UCSB students barred from reentering the U.S.</p>\n<p>For one month following the executive order, Rasekh remained at her home in Iran, unable to return to her studies at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing about it was the rollercoaster,” she told the <em>Nexus</em> in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her first instinct was to wait. She said she had heard “horror stories” of immigrants waiting in limbo at U.S. airports as Customs and Border Protection agents denied visas that many of them had waited months — or even years — to attain.</p>\n<p>All she did was write an email to the embassy asking what had happened.</p>\n<p>Over a week later, a federal appeals court lifted the travel ban. The U.S. embassy responded to her email saying she would receive a visa once again.</p>\n<p>When she obtained her first visa to the United States in 2013, Rasekh had traveled on plane to Ankara, Turkey, the nearest U.S. embassy to Iran. Because Rasekh did not want to make the trip again in early February, she paid a visit to an Iranian travel agency to request they go on her behalf.</p>\n<p>When she returned home from the agency, Rasekh looked on her computer and found another response from the U.S. embassy. The officials told her to “hold off, disregard the previous email and just wait.”</p>\n<p>“I was still scared, [thinking] ‘will they mark it as rejected? What will they do?’” she said.</p>\n<p>Almost another week passed by until the embassy had updated her visa status again. On Feb. 16, the U.S. embassy once again assured her the valid visa that Trump’s travel ban had denied.</p>\n<p>Rasekh returned to UCSB last Monday, Feb. 27, just days before Trump issued a modified executive order on March 6, lifting some restrictions and cementing others.</p>\n<p>The new travel ban allows entry for current U.S. visa holders and refugees who have already been granted asylum and removes travel restrictions from Iraq. Students with J visas, such as Rasekh, will be allowed entry. The ban will go into effect March 16.</p>\n<p>“I scraped past,” she said, adding that many of her family and friends may remain unable to enter the U.S. in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Rasekh’s return last Monday marks the third time she has made the trip to the U.S. She first came to UCSB in February 2013 to join as a researcher in the electrical engineering department.</p>\n<p>It was during her time as a researcher that she met her boyfriend Hassan Arbabi, a fellow Iranian and researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Arbabi acted as a correspondent to the <em>Nexus</em> on Rasekh’s behalf when she was barred in early February.</p>\n<p>“He was actually more stressed out than me. Even when the ban was lifted, he was like, ‘Don’t come on Monday; come on Sunday because you don’t know, maybe he’ll sign a new one,’” she said. “He was really trying to shield me from all his stress and anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Rasekh said her sister, who studies at Boston University, was also worried for Rasekh during Trump’s travel ban. She even tried to put Rasekh in touch with Joe Kennedy, the U.S. Congressman out of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“Everybody here was more stressed out than I think myself,” Rasekh said.</p>\n<p>For the two weeks since her return, Rasekh has been continuing her research in the engineering labs. Because of her prolonged stay in Iran, Rasekh missed a conference on Feb. 21, where she was supposed to present her research, and she was unable to enroll for courses in the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“I arrived too late,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rasekh still expects to receive her Ph.D. in April, although she is unsure whether she will stay in the U.S. after that point.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if U.S. still looks like a good prospect for living,” she said. “I think it’s in the back of all Iranians’ minds that maybe we should plan long-term on somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s latest actions lead her to believe that, for Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States.</p>\n<p>“And it’s not just laws. Just the general atmosphere; if it’s going to keep going toward all this tension, then it’s bad for everybody,” she said. “There’s a reason people choose the U.S. to work and live in, and this could be hurting that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/","id":2418,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2417,2416,2415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Suspended Student Sues to Return to School","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"According to a letter from Doe’s lawyer addressed to the Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, the university has suspended Doe indefinitely since the end of August despite not having ch...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>An incoming freshman at UC Santa Barbara is suing the university to remove a suspension that has barred him from attending the school since August.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, listed as John Doe in court documents, is currently under investigation and was suspended on Aug. 30  after the university “received several student complaints about a 19-second video depicting [Doe] threatening to assault a young woman,” according to the UC Regents’ brief to the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a letter from Doe’s lawyer, Robert P. Ottilie, addressed to the Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, the university has suspended Doe indefinitely since the end of August despite not having charged him with any violation of rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet, even though my client has never been charged by UCSB with any violation of University rules, he sits out of school and it is now clear he will miss the entire school year unless a court ultimately intervenes,” Ottilie said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said UCSB abused a certain section of the UC Regents’ policy on student conduct to hold Doe in suspension, and he wrote in his letter that he hopes they will revoke the statute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be certain the two of you [Chancellor Henry Yang and the Regents] know how the Regents’ statute, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">§</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">105.08, has been abused at UCSB this year. I write for myself, in an effort to educate you and others to revoke this statute,” Ottilie said in a letter. “It seems to me that there is a pattern. Remove certain students from campus, tell them it is only ‘temporary’ until they are investigated, provide little or no support, and then just not investigate. Students without resources will give up and go away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their brief to the court of appeal, the Regents said “the 19-second video depicting [Doe] threatening to assault a young woman amply justified the interim suspension while the University completes its investigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said Doe’s suspension violated the statute’s requirement that the student appears  likely to commit violence or be a threat to safety and that the suspension be the “least restrictive necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents said in their brief to the appeal court that they deemed the video evidence sufficient to prove the student was a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, the threatening video coupled with additional evidence in the University’s possession provided the University with sufficient cause to believe [Doe] posed a sufficient threat to campus safety,” the Regents said in their brief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he was concerned about the way that university suspended the incoming student without being given charges and said he had “never heard of a school that suspends students without charges.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he discovered the case of another student in a similar situation who has also been suspended from UCSB without charges of violating the university’s rules. The other student, referred to as Susan Doe in the letter, “has been missing her entire freshman year, suspended without any underlying investigation, let alone charges or conviction.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe filed an emergency petition for a writ of prohibition to the court of appeal on Feb. 3, which the court accepted on Feb. 7 but has not yet granted. A writ of prohibition is an order from an appellate court to a lower one directing the lower court to act in a particular way. In the lawsuit, John is seeking an injunction from the appellate court which would in effect end his suspension. Ottilie expects the appellate court will give a decision on whether it will provide his client’s requested injunction on his suspension before the beginning of the Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ottilie, John and Susan Doe are both minority students and, in his letter, raised the concern that the university is mistreating them by providing suspensions that they are unable to legally contest because of a lack of financial resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It certainly concerns me that one of the most powerful institutions in our State has treated two young minority students, without financial resources, in such a way,” Ottilie said in a letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said she could not comment on the particular case, but she said the university holds the “safety and wellbeing” of students as its “highest priority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to policies that protect our campus community and survivors of assault while affording fair and consistent due process to those who have been accused,” Estrada said in an email. “The University recognizes the need to ensure that community members have the right to equitable procedures, and we strive to treat each student with dignity and respect.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The language regarding John Doe’s emergency petition was made clearer to show the relationship between the appellate and lower court.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76383\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/suspended-student-sues-to-return-to-school/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76383\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/suspended-student-sues-to-return-to-school/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/suspended-student-sues-to-return-to-school/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/suspended-student-sues-to-return-to-school/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/suspended-student-sues-to-return-to-school/","id":2419,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2418,2417,2416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"George Thurlow Joins CSD on First Day of Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"The CSD held its first public meeting on Tuesday in which the Board elected officers, established three new committees and addressed an open forum of community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Decades of self-governance movements culminated in a six-hour gathering at the Isla Vista Community Room this Tuesday evening when the I.V.

She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.</p>\n<p>“He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,” she said. “So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.</p>\n<p>“After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,” she said.</p>\n<p>Michelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.</p>\n<p>“He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,” Lew said. “Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.”</p>\n<p>Lew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.</p>\n<p>“He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>Lew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.</p>\n<p>“The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,” Lew said. “The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’”</p>\n<p>Lew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.</p>\n<p>“Everything just fit together by random chance,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>In high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.</p>\n<p>Wyatt described Anthony Tsang as “curious and mischievous … but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.”</p>\n<p>“It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.</p>\n<p>“It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,” Wyatt said. “And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.” It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.”</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as “someone you could count on, no matter what it was.”</p>\n<p>“I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in … he wasn’t really one to judge people,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a “huge impact” on his own high school experience.</p>\n<p>“He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,” Wyatt said. “It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he “really loved it.”</p>\n<p>He traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how “nice” and “chill” everyone was there.</p>\n<p>According to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a “big beer enthusiast,” which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.</p>\n<p>“He liked … just how everyone is so easygoing,” Lew said. “He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Lew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.</p>\n<p>Anthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.</p>\n<p>“A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,” Lew said. “We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.</p>\n<p>“He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,” Tiana Tsang said. “And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/","id":2414,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2413,2412,2411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Documents Show 6 UCSB Employees Violated Title IX Policy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-11.22.24-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-11.22.24-AM.png?resize=900%2C432&ssl=1","description":"The documents identify approximately 124 Title IX violations across the UC system between Jan. 1, 2013, and April 6, 2016.

Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.</p>\n<p>The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.</p>\n<p>Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.</p>\n<p>She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”</p>\n<p>The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.</p>\n<p>In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.</p>\n<p>The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76156\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76156\" data-attachment-id=\"76156\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2-27-10-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"465,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen shot 2017-03-02 at 2.27.10 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76156\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=465%2C531\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report in April 2013 alleging that Facilities Management laborer Cresenciano Marin sexually harassed a senior custodian.</p>\n<p>The female subject had previously complained to her supervisors about Marin’s conduct, but she received no resolution. A formal investigation began in April 2013.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the documents, the complainant said while riding in an elevator together during their shift, Marin came up behind her as she bent down and put his hand on her back without her consent and made gestures “as to mock a sexual position.” After she told him he was being inappropriate, he responded that he would find her later and “violate/rape” her.</p>\n<p>The complainant said Marin told her on several other occasions that she should “suck his dick,” asked her the color of her underwear and asked if the color of her pubic hair was the same color as the hair on her head.</p>\n<p>The investigation also found that on an unknown date, coworkers found pornographic videos and newspaper clippings of the <em>Nexus</em>’ “Wednesday Hump” as well as “December 2006 Playboy Magazine Digital Edition” in his cleaning closet.</p>\n<p>Marin denied all such claims, but the Title IX office substantiated all 11 sexual harassment claims against him. The university terminated his employment in July 2013 following the findings of the investigation.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in April 2015 that a UCPD supervisor allegedly sexually harassed his female employee during an after-hours celebration at American Ale in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male subject went to hug his employee and “grabbed her breast,” to which she “stood stupefied” and didn’t say anything. She went to push him away, but he “grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat.” When she turned back around, he tried to hug her and “bit her neck, leaving a mark.”</p>\n<p>The documents report that, when the female returned to the outdoor seating area, she informed the group that she was attacked. A witness reported to the Title IX office that the same male had “pinched his/her buttocks earlier that night.”</p>\n<p>The male subject claimed he “blacked out” the night of the incident and could not respond to the allegations because he could not remember.</p>\n<p>At the time of the allegation, he was working half-time in his department, and he became a full-time employee in July 2015.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UCSB required the male subject to complete the university’s online sexual harassment prevention training and attend personal counseling.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in November 2015 that a music department lecturer allegedly sexually harassed a former music department student.</p>\n<p>The student claimed she was harassed through verbal conduct during piano lessons and that the male subject would comment on other women, saying “so-and-so’s boobs are hanging out,” “so-and-so’s ass cheeks are hanging out” and “women are provocative, and the things they wear seduce men, and it’s no wonder that all these women get raped.”</p>\n<p>Another complainant said the music lecturer would tell her sexualized comments he made to other students like, “If this composer was here, he’d want to seduce you.”</p>\n<p>The male subject denied the allegations against him, but the Title IX office concluded that the conduct “more likely than not did occur” and that the music lecturer had violated UC sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, the male subject received a 10 percent salary reduction and a written censure.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report that a faculty member from the global studies department allegedly sexually harassed a fourth-year undergraduate student.</p>\n<p>According to the female complainant, the male faculty member made jokes promoting rape culture that had no relevance to the class. The jokes were, “What was the wife’s favorite sex position? Facing Nordstrom’s.” and “Why were the sorority girls disappointed about being gang-raped? Because they had to write so many thank-you cards.”</p>\n<p>The female complainant spoke out during lecture, saying that he was being inappropriate. The female subject dropped the global studies class that same day due to the “sexist classroom climate.”</p>\n<p>She stated in her interview with the Title IX office that she could not concentrate for the remainder of the class because she was so upset by his comments. When asked what resolutions she sought through the process, she said that she did not believe the male subject should be teaching at the university.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male faculty member wrote through his attorney that he did not use the words “the wife,” “raped” or “sororities,” but admitted the jokes were made in poor taste.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office substantiated one of the three sexual harassment claims against the faculty member. The documents do not indicate whether the university took further disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university investigated and adjudicated all of the UCSB cases under policies and processes that have since been updated.</p>\n<p>“Over the past two and a half years, UC has taken steps to significantly change — and improve — the ways such cases are handled,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also obtained the Title IX documents of eight other campuses — UC Merced, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC San Diego — and is currently sorting through them to determine further details.</p>\n<p>Although UC Berkeley has not yet sent in its documents, the <em>Daily Cal</em> provided the number of sexual misconduct cases listed for its campus.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76138\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76138\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/","id":2413,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2412,2411,2410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Meeting Focuses on Displaced Students, Deltopia","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Student-Fees-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Student-Fees-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students (A.S.)

Tenants Union (IVTU) spoke during the open forum about students displaced from Del Playa due to the cliff erosion. They have created a $15,000 emergency fund and asked Senate to match these funds to ensure that students have access to new housing, financial support, moving support and legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to pass a resolution to match this funding, giving up to $300 per displaced UCSB student. SBCC students will not be eligible.</p>\n<p>IVTU is also creating an emergency protocol to ensure that students’ needs are met and that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Senate also approved a resolution on the “festival ordinance” in relation to Deltopia, changing the dates of the ordinance to include April 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The bill also aims to increase the role of the external vice president of local affairs in the discussion of the ordinance and open communication between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>They also voted on a resolution regarding advertisements aired on social media discouraging students from coming to I.V. to attend Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Senator Cole Marting expressed concern about a lack of public data about the effectiveness of the advertising and added a stipulation to the resolution asking that the university provide Senate with data.</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with 19 senators in support. Senator Ashley Selki abstained.</p>\n<p>As for items discussed, the meeting began with a statement from Gina Fischer, a representative for Third District County Supervisor Joan Hartmann, about the installation of traffic light at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte.</p>\n<p>Senator Batsheva Stoll expressed concern over the 10 minute intervals between classes when students rush through Pardall, and whether timing on the street lights might affect this.</p>\n<p>“We watch it and make minor tweaks to it to make it run as efficiently as possible,” Scott McGolpin, Santa Barbara public works director, said.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed law enforcement at the stoplight.</p>\n<p>Stoll said “people will be angry with a $200 traffic ticket,” but Deputy James McKarrell said there would first be an educational period ensuring that students understand proper safety, followed by a probationary period with heavy police presence to give out warnings to students who did not obey the light.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t see a change, then we will have an enforcement period,” McKarrell said. “My job is not to necessarily be out here and have you like me; it’s to make sure you get home to your parents.”</p>\n<p>There was also a discussion regarding anti-Semitism that was discussed during the last Senate meeting, with Jack Tannenbaum, third-year economics major, expressing extreme disapproval of the way Senate handled a discussion about anti-Semitism during last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a right of any minority group to define what hate against themselves is,” he said. “It’s extremely inappropriate to diminish harm students are feeling because it’s late at night.”</p>\n<p>Senators all expressed their support. Senator Marting said he had taken the time to fully understand anti-Semitism, and Natalie Jordan said they would consider doing more trainings to help further understanding.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with a statement by Steven Kwok, director of legislative accountability, expressing his disappointment in the lack of engagement by senators with BCUs.</p>\n<p>“I do want to stress how important your presence at meetings is,” he said. “There are a lot of people doing work out there, and I’m not sure how much you know about it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

the closure, enforces environmental restoration regulations. The facility has submitted a plan to the CCC that aims to relocate the stables. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Located near West Campus and the Devereux Slough, the property is home to an historic barn originally built in the 1920s as part of the Campbell Estate. It is now part of the UCSB Horse Boarders Association (HBA).</p>\n<p>According to the updated LRDP, the area that houses the facility will be restored to natural wetlands, although the HBA says the area has not functioned as a wetland in hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Members are concerned the property is being used as “leverage” for the university to gain approval on future development projects from the California Coastal Commission (CCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, said, however, that the stable is located on environmentally sensitive area of campus.</p>\n<p>“Due to the sensitive nature of the area, the California Coastal Commission has required the campus to plan for the removal of the stable facilities,” she said. “They have given us 10 years to remove the facility.”</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university also submitted a Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015, to allow possible relocation of the horse stables. The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s. They have halted definitive closures by pressuring the chancellor’s office with an influx of letters intended to emphasize their value to the community.</p>\n<p>“They think that what we offer doesn’t have enough value, and so they can promise the Coastal Commission that they’ll remove our activity and restore the natural habitat in order to get approval for their other development projects,” said Nuovo.</p>\n<p>LRDP regulations prevent the HBA from changing the aerial view of the barn by creating any new permanent structures, repairs or effectively altering the “footprint” of the barn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75779\" data-attachment-id=\"75779\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/horse-1-by-min-xie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Horse 1 by Min Xie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75779\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stables, located near West Campus and Devereaux Slough, sit atop environmentally sensitive areas.<br>Because of this, the campus has been tasked with closing the facilities down within the next 10 years. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The LRDP restrictions maintain that repairs cannot result in the demolition or reconstruction of 50 percent or more of any structure. The facility also abides by the CCC’s environmental sustainability regulations.</p>\n<p>Lauren Rudnick, a second-year mechanical engineering major and member of the HBA, is currently making repairs to her horse’s stable and is mainly concerned with the longevity and safety of the stall.</p>\n<p>“These restrictions make it difficult to fully repair anything,” Rudnick said, adding that from a legal standpoint, the restrictions could be at fault if the animals or caretakers are harmed.</p>\n<p>Sitting about 300 to 400 yards away from the edge of the horse facility is a wetland buffer zone that the Coastal Commission closely maintains.</p>\n<p>The HBA has planted blackberries, Bermuda grass and other native bushes around the stalls and the buffer zone. The plants absorb nitrogen and other plant-growing material to filter the runoff from the horse’s manure so no harm comes to the wetlands.</p>\n<p>“It is possible to co-exist with the slough. We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/","id":2720,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2719,2718,2717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Currently, new A.S. fees that are on the ballot by student petition need only 51 percent to be added, while fees that are put on by Senate need 60 percent. The referendum would increase the votes necessary for all new fees to two-thirds.</p>\n<p>This referendum also makes it more difficult for student fees to be increased and reaffirmed. Existing lock-in fees must be reaffirmed every two years. The new legislation would mandate that fees that are up for reaffirmation must pass by 60 percent, while fees on the ballot for an increase must pass by 66 percent.</p>\n<p>These amendments will be sent to Elections Committee and will go through Senate at the end of the quarter before being sent to the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>The final bylaw proposes a cap on the amount spent by the Finance and Business Committee on conferences.</p>\n<p>Currently, A.S. Financial Policies and Procedures do not allow non-A.S. organizations to use A.S. funds for expenses related to off-campus conferences. Organizations that want to use funding for conferences can use a one-time exception allowing them to get the funding they need.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t make sense that a huge portion of the finance and business budget goes towards an exception to the rules. We need to either modify the rules or limit spending,” Ian Caples, A.S. Director of Budget and Finance, said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75804\" style=\"width: 626px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75804\" data-attachment-id=\"75804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/a-s-aims-to-lower-student-fees/student-fees-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"616,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student fees graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75804\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=616%2C563\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?w=616&amp;ssl=1 616w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The current proposal is to create a separate category specifically for conferences totaling $70,000, with a $150 per person cap. In previous years, around $80,000 was allocated towards conferences.</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee Chair Reilly Hobson emphasized that the goal of this bylaw was not to decrease student fees but to limit the amount of money spent off campus.</p>\n<p>“I think students don’t realize that the money that Finance and Business Committee has is coming from student fees,” Hobson said. “They think it’s from the university, and then we have to dispense it. It’s actually from students, so when they’re asking for like $600 per student to go to a conference, that’s like three people paying for one person to go.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, said he believes a cap on conference spending will negatively affect minority students.</p>\n<p>“I think that limiting the spending on conferences is very detrimental to a lot of minority communities because a lot of the learning and community building and healing come from going to conferences,” Dumlao said. “I think in trying to limit that you are, in turn, oppressing the communities that you say you are supporting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is expected to vote on the conference cap on Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Last year’s election season saw the emergence of four new parties: The Response, Peer Action Coalition (P.A.C.), Campus United (CU) and Queer and Trans Student Body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU became the dominant party in April, garnering 64 percent of the Senate and three out of five executive seats. The Response won seven seats on the Senate, and P.A.C. took the remaining two seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would not wish to see something like that happen again. In my opinion, you would have it so that no one has the majority,” said Nawar Nemeh, third-year political science major and Isla Vista Party executive member. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to try to dominate. That would be stupid of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, many of Isla Vista Party’s members were active in P.A.C. and The Response last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an obvious overlap. I don’t think that’s an unfair assessment,” Nemeh said. He added that the party includes students with no previous experience in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about 40 active members in the Isla Vista Party, according to Nemeh. He said many of them represent the Black Student Union, El Congreso, Queer Commission, Multicultural Greek Council, UCSB Panhellenic and Inter-Fraternity Council, among other groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how the Isla Vista Party differentiates itself from others, on-campus senator Lesly Silva said the party is “grassroots” and “diverse.” Party members have not yet formed their platform, she said, because they are in the process of gathering input from a range of “historically underrepresented communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reach out to communities asking, what do you need? … What has been on your mind?” she said. “This is a community-based party.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a second-year global studies major, said party members contacted his group, the Queer Commission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, it’s been an afterthought where people have created their parties and then came to the queer communities,” he said. “We really get a say on what the party is doing, and so we get that foundational support instead of support that we would get as an afterthought.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of the Isla Vista Party, Nemeh said, is to change the structure of Senate so that students have increased “decision-making power” at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing the UC shared governance policy, which splits campus responsibility evenly between students, faculty and administration, Nemeh said students have “gotten the short end of the deal recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is to make sure that students have an actual decision-making power that’s not just one seat on an advisory committee. We want them to actually be the decision-makers,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lopez, off-campus senator and third-year sociology and economics double major, said the goal of this party is to elect student government officials who will use the power invested in them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to actually put people in positions where they will have a big influence and will use that influence, rather than putting people into a position because the title sounds nice,” Lopez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, the name of the party is intended to localize the interests of A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to remind people, what do we actually love? What is actually our home? It’s Isla Vista,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU will continue to run a full slate for this spring election. According to Niki Elyasi, a CU organizer and fourth-year biopsychology major, her party will maintain its same mission and values, even with the formation of a new party.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every year there’s more than one party. It’s definitely more competitive than when there’s only one party running,” she said. “I don’t see that changing Campus United style or Campus United mission. I don’t think you’ll see anything different from us. It’s up to the different parties what you’ll see from them.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Attendance during the following two years was “dramatically lower.”<em> Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The advertisements will appear on Pandora, Facebook and television in the weeks leading up to Deltopia, which typically takes place on the first weekend after spring break.</p>\n<p>According to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning, the funding for these advertisements comes from unrestricted gift funds, which are donations made by alumni.</p>\n<p>He said the university spent $41,000 in advertising for Deltopia and $30,000 for Halloween last year. According to Haines, UCSB typically runs these campaigns for three to four weeks, spending $10,000 per week of advertising.</p>\n<p>Students throughout California have reported hearing Pandora ads dissuading them from travelling to Santa Barbara for festivities held on both Deltopia and Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Deltopia ad campaign, the university also contributes $15,000 per year to the much larger countywide “Keep Isla Vista Safe” campaign that runs television and radio advertisements year-round.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, UCSB shares the cost of “Keep Isla Vista Safe” with local agencies including the City of Goleta, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff and Santa Barbara City College.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, campaign organizers posted a video on their Facebook page warning viewers that attending Deltopia could potentially result in mugshots.</p>\n<p>The video also cautions viewers of the 300-officer police force, extra DUI checkpoints and severe parking restrictions. The hashtags #LocalsOnlyBrah and #StillPayingForIt were widely circulated on the page in preparation for last year’s Deltopia.</p>\n<p>The Nexus reported in April that students spoke out against “Keep Isla Vista Safe,” saying that the campaign received no input from students and inaccurately portrayed Isla Vista. The UCSB Task Force Against Police Brutality and the Black Student Union also held silent demonstrations at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Student Affairs also sends letters to local high school and middle school principals discouraging young Isla Vistans from attending party weekends.</p>\n<p>The office sends a similar letter to college students in California detailing potential risks that Deltopia poses, such as severe parking restrictions, police presence and increased law and ordinance enforcement. Debbie Fleming, the assistant vice chancellor of student affairs, oversees the letters.</p>\n<p>“This letter goes to my counterpart at all the other UC campuses, and we ask for it to be distributed to students,” Fleming said. “We have a list of other California colleges that includes schools from which students have been arrested or cited in Isla Vista during past years.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Affairs additionally sends UCSB students emails with safety information prior to events such as Halloween and Deltopia that emphasize the university’s policy on visitors. Residence halls do not permit students to have guests during that timeframe. The university also runs ads in the <em>Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line.</em></p>\n<p>The EVPLA office, which participates in the “Keep Isla Vista Local” campaign, sent postcards to each address in I.V. prior to Halloween weekend, in addition to communicating safety information before both Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Deltopia 2015 and 2016 witnessed a significant decrease in attendance paired with a drop in the number of arrests and citations.</p>\n<p>In a statement released on the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, authorities reported that last year’s turnout of 3,500 people was “dramatically lower” than the 10,000 people who were estimated to have attended in 2015 and the 20,000 to 25,000 people who attended in 2014.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board also holds a spring concert restricted only to UCSB students, which prevents visitors from attending.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a lot of really positive feedback from students who like having a fun alternative that is for UCSB students only,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Higher Education’s (AASHE) Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (S.T.A.R.S.). UCSB also received a gold ranking in 2014.</p>\n<p>AASHE received submissions from 800 schools in 30 countries. The association’s rating system allows universities to track their progress in improving campus sustainability.</p>\n<p>UCSB received 73.4 points out of a possible 100, with a nearly perfect score in diversity and accessibility, but it fell short in curriculum, energy and food and dining.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.S. report found that more than half of all students at UCSB felt that courses generally incorporated diverse perspectives, and a significant majority of the school community is satisfied with the overall climate.</p>\n<p>“Social equity is critical,” Mo Lovegreen, the director of campus sustainability who spearheaded the submission, said. “As we’ve grown, we’ve been more inclusive, and we figured out methodologies to make sure we’re more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Despite the high diversity score, the report details areas for improvement in the university, citing that 24 percent of respondents believed they had experienced exclusionary or offensive conduct, and 3 percent of respondents saying they had experienced unwanted sexual contact.</p>\n<p>The report also showed a significant weakness in learning outcomes, with UCSB receiving only .95 out of eight points. Out of the 3,773 courses offered, only 102 address the interconnectivity between humans and the environment.</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree from the perspective of academic freedom,” Lovegreen said. “You can’t require all disciplines to teach [sustainability], but we’ve done, I think, amazing on our campus [because] there are that many departments that are offering content about the environment and sustainability.”</p>\n<p>The university offers incentives such as New Leaf grants to help incorporate sustainability into other courses, as well as faculty members who are helping to incorporate sustainability in courses.</p>\n<p>Food and beverage purchasing was also a weak category, with UCSB receiving .95 out of six points.</p>\n<p>The submission process, which took over 800 hours, began early last year, according to Lovegreen. The process took longer than expected due to a change in the requirements and was ultimately finished on Nov. 8, costing around $3,200 in wages for student interns who helped compile the report.</p>\n<p>“We’re glad they’re over, so now we can get onto other stuff. We are ecstatic about that,” Lovegreen said. “We only do it every other year because it’s so time intensive. We have to make progress on our campus on other areas.”</p>\n<p>Despite the large time commitment, Lovegreen said she believes the program is worth the time because it allows the university to gauge its progress and rank against other schools. The S.T.A.R.S. award also helps the university decide what steps should be taken for further improvement, she said.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen said she hopes to improve the ranking to platinum, the program’s highest available ranking, by 2020. It will take many small steps in a variety of areas, she said, and will also include larger action aligning with Janet Napolitano’s carbon neutrality initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s just crafting a plan,” Lovegreen said. “How hard is that?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
