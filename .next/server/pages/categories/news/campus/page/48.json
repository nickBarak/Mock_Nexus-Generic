style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former UCSB student Daniel J. Chen was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in San Ramon on Feb. 10, 2016 and charged with two counts of rape and is currently being held without bail in the Santa Barbara County Jail awaiting trial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the lawsuit, the UC Regents motioned to strike four specific portions of its text, saying the allegations were not valid enough to carry out legal action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck on June 28 overruled the Regent’s challenge with </span><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/os/tr/tentative-detail.php?RuleID=48964\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each of the plaintiff’s allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among four claims, the Regents said the lawsuit did not explain how the foliage-covered area created a “forseeable risk” for the plaintiff’s injuries. The lawsuit, however, alleges that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are more than sufficient allegations to support the inference that it was foreseeable that a student walking in the area, particularly a female student, might be the victim of a sexual assault or other criminal activity,” the court ruled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also argued that the plaintiff failed to explain how the area was dangerous and describe how the “dangerous condition” led to the plaintiff’s injuries. The court rejected both of the arguments and the the lawsuit will proceed in its original form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents had approximately 10 days to respond to the court’s ruling, and the plaintiff and defendant will now begin negotiating whether the case will go to trial or end with a settlement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrone Maho, an attorney representing the plantiff, said the woman is still hoping for a settlement in the case.</span></p>\n<p>“She wants accountability, not just by the people that did this to her, but for the university to allow this dangerous condition to exist,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys representing both parties will hold the next status conference on Sept. 16.

The remaining 97 votes went toward other Democratic and third-party candidates.</p>\n<p>Nearly 90 percent of voters chose to support Democratic candidates at the polls. Abboud said Sanders’s strong lead was likely due to support from the Sanders campaign support throughout campus and I.V.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just that people wanted to vote for Bernie, but Bernie helped get people politically aware,” Abboud said. “A lot of the people we talked to knew about the issues very early on, so it was a good year.”</p>\n<p>The voter turnout among UCSB students and I.V. residents is even more astonishing because the primary election was held on last week of the quarter, when most students were completing final exams.</p>\n<p>“The numbers … show the level of organization and volunteer efforts here for the primary were extremely higher than average,” Abboud said. “The whole campaign was centered around driving turnout, because the primary was during finals week.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also noted that UCSB and I.V. voters will be especially important to the general election in November because of specific ballot measures, such as a marijuana legalization bill and the vote for I.V. to become a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Community Services District election is in November and that is the most direct thing anyone could ever vote on to make Isla Vista a better place,” Abboud said. “So we believe that the excitement and the promise of CSD plus the importance of all the other races of elected office and the wide array of propositions on the ballot will be driving factors for people to vote.”</p>\n<p>Voters in Santa Barbara also selected candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the state senate, assembly and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. Final results will be determined after the general election on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 23, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this story said Clinton had won the Democratic presidential nomination, she has not yet secured the nomination.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/","id":2467,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2466,2465,2464],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Police Assist UCLA after Shooting, Boost Presence at Home","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/UCLA-EDITED-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/UCLA-EDITED-1.png?resize=726%2C365&ssl=1","description":"Less than 24 hours after the shooting at UCLA, six members of the UCSB Police Department arrived in Los Angeles to aid local officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68191\" style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68191\" data-attachment-id=\"68191\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-05/ucsb-police-assist-ucla-after-shooting-boost-presence-at-home/pizzawithcop_dustin-harris-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pizzawithcop_Dustin-Harris-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pizzawithcop_Dustin Harris-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pizzawithcop_Dustin-Harris-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pizzawithcop_Dustin-Harris-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68191\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pizzawithcop_Dustin-Harris-1.jpg?resize=730%2C487\" alt=\"UCPD Sgt.

Rob Romero and five others again prepared for the 100-mile drive to Los Angeles, arriving later that morning.</p>\n<p>Because of the uneasiness on campus, UCPD officers provided security for several events that would not usually require a police presence, Romero said. They also responded to emergency calls, freeing up UCLA officers who Romero said “are really wrapped up in the investigation” of the gunman.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to show the community at UCLA that you’re safe,” Romero said by phone from UCLA on Thursday. “We’re here to listen, to give hugs, sometimes just to talk to people about what happened.”</p>\n<p>The UCPD officers returned to UCSB late Friday night, but are “ready to redeploy if needed,” Romero said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition to assisting at UCLA, university police are increasing their presence at UCSB as well.</p>\n<p>“I also understand and expect that these tragic events can also have an impact on our own campus and so I have increased the law enforcement presence, accordingly,” UCPD Chief Dustin Olson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, the dean of student life, said there would be more officers on campus until after graduation ceremonies next weekend, noting that she had seen UCPD vehicles parked near Henley Gate and the University Plaza.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71663\" style=\"width: 233px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71663\"

its <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> with resources and is ready for students who seek help following the UCLA shooting.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen any notable increase right now, but we’ll have to see over the coming days,” Dr. Janet Osimo, a psychologist at CAPS, said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not uncommon for this kind of thing to reactivate people who were here during the Isla Vista tragedy,” Osimo said, referring to the 2014 shooting that left six UCSB students dead. “They might not be feeling safe and be scared and uncertain … that’s a pretty common response.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people should take special care to get adequate rest, eat well, and give themselves “permission to feel different, because that’s a really common reaction.”</p>\n<p>On Twitter, many students from UC schools showed support for UCLA students by using the hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/weareoneuc\" target=\"_blank\">#WeAreOneUC</a>, which also surfaced

Dhadkan, which means “heartbeat” in Hindi, was founded by fourth-year students Soham Tikekar and Nishitha Viswanathan during their freshman year when they were studying physics in the library.</p>\n<p>The organization manages and plans events that combine South Asian culture and the arts with charities that provide education to children in India. Its motto is “Philanthropy through artistry.”</p>\n<p>For the past three years, Dhadkan has sent proceeds from its events to schools throughout India, providing education in rural areas and money to build more schools. Last year, they were able to support three schools for an entire year with the funds they raised.</p>\n<p>Tikekar and Viswanathan said they were both “surprised” when they learned Dhadkan had won OSL Group of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We completely didn’t know we had a chance of winning,” said Viswanathan, a biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>Despite Tikekar and Viswanathan’s initial shock, Dhadkan has made incredible steps for the South Asian community in the past year, which led to its winning the award.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\"><p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want.”<br>\n— Soham Tikekar</p></blockquote>\n<p>From successfully hosting Nachle Deewane, an annual philanthropic South Asian dance competition in downtown Santa Barbara, to collaborating with Associated Students Program Board to bring DJ Jai Wolf to the University Center Hub, Dhadkan has made immense steps toward raising money for Indian education and bringing South Asian culture to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have accomplished a lot,” said Tikekar, a biology and economics double major. “We put in a lot of time, and it’s kind of a barrier we thought we’d have to break to get to the main campus environment. Winning this award really solidified this idea that, yeah, a cultural organization really can get to the top.”</p>\n<p>The co-founders explained that during their freshman year, they felt the South Asian presence on campus was lacking. By creating Dhadkan, they expanded the possibilities for South Asian students and made UCSB a more welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make our mark on this campus, and we both grew up with Indian arts and Indian culture; we were just surrounded by it,” Viswanathan said. “Then we came here, and we kind of didn’t get that same experience, so we wanted to do something.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71639\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"443103063\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71618\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71639\" data-attachment-id=\"71639\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71639\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o-1024x681.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71639\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tikekar and Viswanathan announce awards for winners at the 2016 Nachle Deewane competition. <em>Courtesy of Lorenzo Basilio for UCSB Dhadkan</em></p></div>\n<p>Tikekar said Dhadkan’s dedication to children’s education in India stemmed from the group’s belief that “education is the most sustainable branch of philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want,” Tikekar said.</p>\n<p>Many Indians do not receive an education past grade school, Tikekar and Viswanathan said, and so they work to provide Indian children a full education so they can achieve their career goals and provide for their families.</p>\n<p>“Even though, officially, child labor is illegal, it’s obviously still very prevalent in a country like India, so [children] automatically go into the workforce, and that’s their entire life,” Viswanathan said. “With an education … they can bring their family and themselves out of that poverty cycle.”</p>\n<p>As finals roll in and graduation day approaches, Tikekar and Viswanathan are beginning to think about their post-commencement plans and how they can incorporate their experience with Dhadkan into the competitive job market.</p>\n<p>Viswanathan said she has developed skills through Dhadkan that are “very applicable” to life beyond college, such as learning about managing and running an organization and interacting and communicating with colleagues and venue owners;

If given nonprofit status, Tikekar said he hopes Dhadkan could achieve goals even beyond those of a university organization.</p>\n<p>“As graduates and us as alumni of the school, we hope to still mentor and guide the people who still go here and [are] actually creating their own projects,” Tikekar said. “Hopefully, next year and the year after, we can design our own charity work, maybe go to India and execute it ourselves rather than just donating to a third party nonprofit.”</p>\n<p>“Once we all graduate, we have that alumni network,” Tikekar added. “Everyone is doing different things in different industries, they have different skill sets, so at one point we ideally want to come together to do a project.”</p>\n<p>Of course, before Tikekar and Viswanathan can put those skills to use, they have to walk across the commencement stage and receive their diplomas.</p>\n<p>“I’m remembering back to the time when we were freshmen and we didn’t have sort of a comfort zone here,” Tikekar said. “We’ve built that over the last four years. I’m looking forward to seeing where stepping out of my comfort zone is after I graduate, after I leave this one right here.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of  the Thursday, June 2, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/","id":2462,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2461,2460,2459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Class of 2016 Looks to Life After Graduation","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thing.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thing.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As UC Santa Barbara’s graduating class prepares to walk the line next week, nearly 5,000 students are looking to the future for life after college.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Next week, almost 5,000 students will graduate from UC Santa Barbara.</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_71622\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71622\" data-attachment-id=\"71622\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=1131%2C724&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1131,724\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=888%2C569&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-71622\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2-1024x656.png?resize=888%2C569\" alt=\"Students from the College of Creative Studies are headed around the country after graduating UC Santa Barbara.

Current seniors entered college as Barack Obama began his second term as president and were a year later confronted with both the Deltopia riots and the May 23, 2014, shooting as most phased into their twenties.</p>\n<p>The self-governance movement in Isla Vista took hold later that year, and students and faculty came together to improve life in the small college town. Now, another presidential election has taken young people by the reins, and graduating students are facing the future with contrasting college experiences.</p>\n<p>The four-year graduation rate for UCSB students typically fluctuates around 68 percent, according to the UCSB Campus Profile, and 4,687 students are scheduled to attend commencement ceremonies on June 11 and 12, according to Cathy Pollock, assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_8fb6d586-3953-4c78-a23c-032c7a0f6c57\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?B8C\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>While the majority of graduating students are seniors, this number includes students from other class levels who will be graduating early, as well as students who graduated prior to Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Although students from the College of Letters &amp; Science are able to attend whichever commencement ceremony they choose, the largest group of students is scheduled to graduate with the social sciences division, numbering over 2,000 students. UCSB’s largest undergraduate departments are physical and biological sciences at 31 percent, followed by social and cultural studies at 14 percent.</p>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS), UCSB’s smallest college, will be graduating approximately 90 students next week. Maintaining CCS’s standard of “A Graduate School for Undergraduates,” nearly half of CCS seniors will head to graduate school next year. Approximately 20 percent of the remaining students plan to pursue graduate education in the following year, and 17 percent are headed straight to their prospective careers.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_fba0f287-85f9-47b4-a02c-ceebd29991ee\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?2Dp\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am\" target=\"_blank\">Create your own infographics</a></div>\n<p>CCS students will be attending schools across the country including Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Duke and Berklee College of Music, according to Sara Sterphone, student affairs officer for CCS. A little over 2 percent of students will continue research at UCSB, and other students will attend in-state programs at Chapman, Stanford, UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>When the current senior class enrolled as freshmen, 44 percent of applicants were admitted to UCSB and 18,977 undergraduates populated the university. The school has since grown to accommodate 20,607 undergraduates, and UCSB accepted 32.7 percent of applicants in 2015.</p>\n<p>Along with rising numbers, UCSB’s demographics have undergone significant shifts since 2012. In fall 2015, UCSB was named a Hispanic Serving Institution due to its significant enrollment of students who identify as Chicano/a and Latino/a. Reflecting the criteria for this title, this demographic now represents 27 percent of the undergraduate population as opposed to 24 percent four years ago.</p>\n<p>To offset reduced funding from the state, UCSB has also shifted its enrollment of in-state students along with the rest of the University of California. In fall 2012, 94 percent of UCSB students were California residents and the remainder were out-of-state or international residents. In-state enrollment percentages have gone down by 4 percent as of 2015, and 6 percent of students are now enrolled from outside of California. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes have sparked controversy throughout the state and students and legislators are pushing the UC to prioritize residents of California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC, although disputed, will continue to change, and as seniors look back on their education, they will remember varying bits of the institutions that placed them in adulthood. For now, they scramble to complete the last of their exams and face the next few months with confusion, excitement and an ever-critical outlook. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/","id":2463,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2462,2461,2460],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Interfraternity Council Did Not Bribe Voters, Committee Says","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After investigating  bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC), a UC Santa Barbara committee says it has found no evidence of wrongdoing.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_70463\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70463\" data-attachment-id=\"70463\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/brendan-gonzalez-speaks-to-as-senate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1345&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1345\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brendan Gonzalez speaks to AS Senate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-70463\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1-1024x689.jpg?resize=888%2C597\" alt=\"Inter-Fraternity Council president and UCSB second-year student Brendan Gonzalez listens to questions asked by AS off-campus senator Akshaya Natarajan during public comment during the AS Senate meeting at the Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday, April 27, 2016.

Elections Board </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-26/a-s-elections-board-calls-for-re-vote-due-to-alleged-bribery-by-inter-fraternity-council/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alleged</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the IFC “bribed” its chapters by awarding philanthropic grants to those that achieved the highest voter turnout. The A.S. Senate called upon UC Santa Barbara Audit and Advisory Services to investigate the allegations.</span></p>\n<p>The committee found that the grants were “intended as more of a contest among IFC member fraternities” than a bribe, Robert Tarsia, directory of audit and advisory services, said in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Investigation-Report-re-Spring-Elections-Preliminary-Findings-052616.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez, on May 26.</p>\n<p>Because the grants did not encourage voting for specific candidates and measures and were intended to be awarded to fraternity chapters instead of individuals, Tarsia says, the committee found no evidence of bribery.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 6, the A.S. Elections Board issued a public <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ALetterfromtheA.S.ElectionsBoard.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">apology</a> to the IFC. Although it stands by its decision to bring the issue to the public, the board said its allegation of bribery was “the wrong word to use and a bold accusation to make.” </span></p>\n<p>“We are genuinely sorry for any damage we did to the reputations of any organizations or fellow students,” the board states in its apology. “The intention of our letter was not to vilify any student or group, but rather to inform the student body of our concerns.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board also apologized to Gonzalez, saying that it “unintentionally hurt a fellow student” while pursuing its goal of ensuring a fair election process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of Elections Board knows how difficult it is to be a student, so we apologize for the added pressure, scrutiny and unwanted attention our accusation has brought Brendan,” the board states. </span></p>\n<p>According to its letter, the audit and advisory committee came to its conclusion after interviewing several parties, including the student who initially brought the complaint to the elections board, as well as IFC Council Advisor Miles Ashlock and IFC President Brendan Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Ashlock, who is also the assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, told the committee that he approved the original grant program, based on his understanding that all money would be used for “charitable activities.”</p>\n<p>The letter says participation in the program was voluntary, and “participation thresholds” would determine the amount of grant money awarded, between $200 and $400 for the winning chapter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community.”</p>\n<p>— Brendan Gonzalez</p></blockquote>\n<p>The IFC intended to distribute the grants after the election, but Gonzalez said they have currently suspended the program in light of the ongoing investigation. If further results continue to prove that the IFC grants were not bribes, however, Gonzalez said the program will likely continue as planned.</p>\n<p>The committee also interviewed Marquez, the A.S Elections Board and other members of the A.S. staff, according to the letter, and Tarsia notes that the committee researched the spring election through campus newspaper articles and social media posts.</p>\n<p>As it continues the investigation, the committee will determine whether the IFC’s intended grants resulted in “serious voting irregularity as a result of undue influence on student voting.” It will also research if the grants violated the A.S. Elections Code, Campus Elections Commission Guidelines or Campus Regulations.</p>\n<p>The committee says in the letter that the A.S Elections Board was acting in an “unprecedented” situation and acknowledges that its request for an investigation was “a prudent one.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez initially responded to the bribery allegations in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April, saying that “The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants.” In an email Wednesday, he said he was glad the preliminary findings confirmed what he has  “known and repeated from the start.”</span></p>\n<p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community,” Gonzalez, a second-year political science major, said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the A.S. Senate is no longer in session, outgoing A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal, who shared Tarsia’s report in an email Wednesday, said further matters regarding the investigation will be directed by the Villarreal Election Commission.

all campus services on June 16, affecting access cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students.</p>\n<p>Celestino Jones, a second-year music composition major, came out as transgender during the beginning of his second year at UCSB. “I’ve been stopped at the dining commons before because I don’t look like a ‘Celeste,’” Jones said, after undergoing hormone therapy that changed his appearance.</p>\n<p>He now has the opportunity to purchase a new access card with his preferred name without having to legally change his documentation.</p>\n<p>“It grew out of the desire to support transgender students specifically, because there are many transgender students whose legal name is not consistent with their identity,” Leesa Beck, the university registrar, said. She also hopes the efforts will improve academic experiences for international students who may use alternate names.</p>\n<p>Students are currently able to change their name through Identity Services or by submitting a petition to the registrar. Certain programs, such as G.O.L.D., source data directly from the registrar’s office, but many organizations such as GauchoSpace interact with numerous other databases like Identity Services.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the summer, the registrar’s office hopes to streamline all name change requests by communicating their information to as many “data feeds” as possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We think we have caught most of the major ones, but there are literally hundreds around the campus, so we may continue to find ones that we have missed, and have to make updates after we go live,” Beck said.</p>\n<p>Departments that require legal verification, such as the financial aid office, Student Health and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services, are the only groups that will receive both the legal name and the preferred name for each student. Staff members at these locations will be directed to use preferred names when addressing students and legal names when submitting and verifying claims, Beck said.</p>\n<p>The new system will only allow students to change first names, requiring legal documentation to change last names. Although this leaves room for falsification, Beck said she has spoken with schools who use preferred names and found that students “almost never abuse the system.”</p>\n<p>“It would be like putting a weird fake name on LinkedIn or something. No one wants that to be the name their professors are calling them by,” she said. “So for now there will be no “policing” of the names entered. If it becomes a problem down the line, we will reassess.”</p>\n<p>The registrar’s office will be working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to publicize and implement the changes after Spring Quarter grades are finalized.</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, the director of the RCSGD, said “a lot of people take names and pronouns for granted” because they never feel misrepresented by their legal name.</p>\n<p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift,” he said. “We just want students to feel like there are services in place that validate the experiences that they are having.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way.” — Celestino Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>When beginning previous quarters at UCSB, Jones said he would sometimes find himself staying quiet during roll call, waiting until the end of class to correct his teachers about his name. He is “grateful” that professors and teaching assistants will only have access to his preferred name next year, and said several other students will benefit as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way,” he said. “It can alleviate a lot of stress, I suppose, if the name that you prefer is the name that everyone calls you by.”</p>\n<p>Although the new system will be implemented throughout UCSB in the fall, Jones, who is a chair for the RCGSD transgender taskforce, said it will not be a “fix-all” for transgender inclusivity.

Instead, she said all organizations must seek to understand science and its worldwide implications.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen, very recently, several discussions going on in both the news and among politicians about things like climate change, questions about vaccinations, questions about various topics … questions all about policy making,” Lunsford said.</p>\n<p>Lunsford said students from all departments are encouraged to apply for the minor if they have an interest in understanding scientific research.</p>\n<p>“As long as you’re interested in a S.T.E.M. topic, we can help teach you how to read that material,” Lunsford said. “It is a different route from someone who already has that major, but we do need people coming in from both directions, seeing what people can understand and interpret for another audience.”</p>\n<p>Professor Doug Bradley, who will teach scientific literacy in the Winter Quarter, said his class will specialize in learning the basic concepts of science and how students can use multimedia to deliver the information to a large audience.</p>\n<p>Bradley said course assignments will have students presenting data in “unique ways” to connect non-S.T.E.M. people to the science field through scientific and quantitative graphics.</p>\n<p>“In terms of science communication, good practice would be to connect as efficiently as possible with your audience, a broad audience … and convey ideas and issues to them that will get them to orient their lives in ways that accord with rational scientific thinking,” Bradley said.</p>\n<p>Professor Janet Mizrahi, who will be teaching science communication for the public, said her students will spend Spring Quarter writing press releases and news stories, creating websites and recording podcasts.</p>\n<p>Mizrahi wants students to learn the best ways to communicate in the workplace through writing and technology, regardless of the career they eventually pursue.<br>\n“I hope they not only become better citizens and better writers, but also more marketable college graduates,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p>Bradley said “it is particularly urgent right now,” for students to learn from the minor because UCSB was recently ranked eighth in worldwide research by the international Leiden Ranking system.</p>\n<p>“That means our professionals need to make darn sure the information they’re conveying to the public is spot on target,” he continued. “We’re trying to support that leadership that the campus is already showing and push it out even further.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the

Team</em></p></div>\n<p>A second-year UC Santa Barbara student passed away Friday in a hospital after attempting to take his own life two days before.</p>\n<p>Hayden Werner, pre-biology major and honors student, was actively involved in the Snow Team during his time at UCSB and was set to lead the group as an officer next year.</p>\n<p>Shoshana Cohen, recent UCSB graduate, was Werner’s teammate and said she saw him as a “little brother,” watching him transition through his first and second year of college.</p>\n<p>“He went from an average skier … into a skier who really put it upon himself to go up to Mammoth [Mountain] and make it his life in the winter,” Cohen said. By his second year, she said Werner was a “top part of the team.”</p>\n<p>Along with other members of the team, Cohen and Werner would frequently drive up to Mammoth Mountain for skiing and snowboarding excursions. These trips created memories to last a lifetime, Cohen said, and made their friendship of two years feel like much longer.</p>\n<p>“For me, the favorite parts were the car rides up to Mammoth,” she said. “Just being in that car, and freestyle rapping up the 395, the entire way … it wouldn’t matter how late we got to Mammoth.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said Werner’s friends came together in Isla Vista after his passing to heal and celebrate his life, finding closure by remembering his influence upon their lives.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing that Hayden taught me was to have gratitude and to really recognize all the beauty that surrounds you in life,” Cohen said. “It’s not like I’m moving on, I’m moving forward. I will always have a piece of Hayden with me.”</p>\n<p>Werner was also a lifeguard in Orange County and an avid surfer, according to an email sent on Tuesday by Katya Armistead, the dean of student life.</p>\n<p>The Orange County lifeguards have arranged a sunset paddle-out at 6:30 p.m. on May 30 at Dana Strand Beach in Dana Point.</p>\n<p>A memorial service will be held for Hayden on May 31, at 11 a.m. at the Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services

href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1527447800885678/\" target=\"_blank\">lecture</a> is at 7 p.m. on Thursday in Corwin Pavilion and is sponsored by YAL.</p>\n<p>Students and faculty walked and biked under the tunnel, many stopping to shout at the students holding the banner, either in support or disgust.</p>\n<p>“You have more balls than I do,” said one man as he patted a YAL member on the back. Another man said he supported the group’s message but feared being associated with them publicly.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students stood on the Isla Vista side of the tunnel, arguing over issues including abortion, rape statistics and the definition of feminism.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71379\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"320582374\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71384\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71379\" data-attachment-id=\"71379\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/feminism-is-cancer-banner-leads-to-heated-discussions/fem-is-cancer-banner-by-vivian-bui-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Fem is Cancer Banner 5/24\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71379 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fem-is-Cancer-Banner-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of YAL hoped the banner would spark a conversation, but some observers said the discussions were hostile. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>YAL President Dominick DiCesare, a second-year computer science major, said the group hoped to spur a conversation about feminism on campus.</p>\n<p>“What came from [the banner] is seven or eight groups of people having their own productive discussions,” DiCesare said. “I will admit it is Machiavellian by all extents, but the fact that it gets people discussing academically on campus is most important for me.”</p>\n<p>DiCesare said Yiannopoulos is a “provocateur,” and so “it makes sense that the event’s advertisements would be as provocative as the event.”</p>\n<p>Beneath the tunnel, many students disagreed that the banner resulted in constructive conversations.</p>\n<p>“These people aren’t trying to have a productive conversation in any way,” said a third-year zoology major who declined to give her name. “There are two different groups that are having this conversation and they’re both just yelling at each other.”</p>\n<p>Maria Velez, a second-year political science and feminist studies double major, said she planned on going to Yiannopoulos’s event to show her disagreement. Velez said comparing feminism to cancer is distasteful.</p>\n<p>“I just finished being a team leader for Relay For Life, where the university raised thousands of dollars for cancer, and now [YAL] is using the term so lightly,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several UCSB students responded to the banner on Twitter.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 130px;\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">is the “feminism is cancer” sign supposed to be positive cause feminism is spreading or is it saying it’s bad cause it’s compared to cancer?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">— Mica (@micapica96) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/micapica96/status/735218724874031104\">May 24, 2016</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p>\nSomeone put a “feminism is cancer” poster on pardall tunnel..

Moderates might say, ‘I don’t agree with those YAL people, but I do have problems with feminism.’”</p>\n<p>One UCSB student encouraged bystanders to walk to the area above Pardall Tunnel and speak

McLane Brown / Daily Nexus </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>Seventy-five dancers, each barefoot, dressed in all white and carrying a simple white terracotta plate performed a ritualistic dance in Storke Plaza on Monday to celebrate peace and to mark the second anniversary of the May 23, 2014, shooting.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Department of Theater and Dance, in conjunction with the Buglisi Dance Theatre of New York, performed the “Table of Silence Project,” a dance originally choreographed by Jacqulyn Buglisi, director of the Buglisi Dance Theatre. The hour-long ceremony was first performed at the Lincoln Center on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>The ritual honored the lives of Weihan Wang, Cheng Hong, George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Veronika Weiss and Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and simultaneously acted as a call and celebration for peace and unity.</p>\n<p>The dancers moved in unison along circular patterns reminiscent of a mandala and culminated the ritual in a minute of silence, seated in concentric circles and their arms outstretched, palms facing up to the sky.</p>\n<p>“Today we stop and remember these six students and celebrate their beautiful lives,” Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in his opening statement.</p>\n<p>To memorialize the lives and contributions of the six students, Chancellor Yang presented six scholarships to current UCSB students prior to the Table of Silence performance. The student recipients were Lindsey Choate, Jennie Christensen, Aileen Fullchange, Joshua Ortiz, Taylor J. Stolzfus and Michael Teller.</p>\n<p>“Each of these recipients reflects the character, passions, kindness, intelligence and ambition of the six students we lost, ensuring that they will always live on in UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said. “They are true leaders who have shown a deep commitment to their education and their community.”</p>\n<p>According to Buglisi, the choreographer of the ritual, the dancers descended upon the plaza “forming patterns of concentric circles to create a Peace Labyrinth, seen as in ancient times.”</p>\n<p>“As they form the Peace Labyrinth, they will bring out the mandala energy, symbolizing the eternity, purity and continuity of the life cycle,” Buglisi said. “Creating a ritual honoring our natural world around us, for peace and harmony.”</p>\n<p>Patrick Lindley, principal musician of UCSB Theater and Dance, was the musical director for the Table of Silence Project. The dancers performed in collaboration with Azeem Ward on flute, William Pasley and Russ Glick on percussion, Emiliano Campobello on flute and conch shell, Margo Halstead on carillon and vocals provided by UCSB’s a cappella group Naked Voices.</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, UCSB’s Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani addressed those who passed away in remembrance.</p>\n<p>“We feel, we hope, we trust that your souls are at peace,” Bhavnani said. “We will always remember you. Fiat lux, let there be light.”</p>\n<p><em>[Update May 24, 2:00 p.m. : This article has been updated to include a full list of performers.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/","id":2486,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[2485,2484,2483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Open to Latino Students’ Demands","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/El-Centro-5-23-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/El-Centro-5-23-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"High-ranking university officials sat with students in El Centro for hours, going point-by-point through a list of demands made by Latino UC Santa Barbara students.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Several high-ranking university officials including Chancellor Henry T.

Following the afternoon discussion in El Centro, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said UCSB was making the group’s demands a high priority.</p>\n<p>“I think you can tell that we’re taking this seriously because you have a lot of university leadership here today and yesterday,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning that more than a quarter of its students are Hispanic. Currently, 27 percent of UCSB students report that they are Hispanic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“These reforms are for the 27 percent here to keep that 27 percent here,” said Jasmine Ortiz, first-year environmental studies major. “We already struggle coming from our communities to get here and then we have to struggle twice as hard to maintain our positions here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sit-down in El Centro, a building near the library that serves as a meeting place for several Latino student-advocacy groups, was direct and productive, with Marisela Márquez, the executive director of Associated Students, serving as a mediator between administrators and students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrators largely seemed open to the students’ demands, at one point remarking that none of VOCEROS’ requests seemed impossible. As the group went through the list, Márquez asked that administrators list barriers to completing the demands as well as solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often, administrators said time and money are the main barriers hindering the completion of VOCEROS’ demands. For example, Maria Herrera-Sobek, the associate vice chancellor for diversity, equity and academic policy, said she was instrumental in creating a Chicano Department at UC Irvine, but that it took more than 15 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“It does take some time, but it is not impossible,” Herrera-Sobek said of creating a Central American major and department at UCSB. “You can start right away by having a committee of students and faculty and administrators exploring and identifying the courses that are out there already” that could fulfill the proposed major’s requirements.</span></p>\n<p>Garcia said there is a need for a Central America-specific department and major because Hispanic spaces on campus often focus on Mexican-Americans.</p>\n<p>“Within the Latinx community, we want to break the barriers between communities,” Garcia said, using a term designed to include Latino and Latina students and Hispanic students who do not identify within traditional gender roles.</p>\n<p>“Students feel like the Chicano Department and a lot of the other resources we have are very Mexican-centric,” Garcia said. “We’re not trying to pit departments against each other or trying to get resources from another department, but more-so trying to expand what we already have and be that 100 percent that we want to be.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the groups’ most feasible demands, according to administrators, is the institution of a Latinx Parents Weekend. Klawunn said she would work to add some of the proposed changes into the fall parents weekend, such as bilingual events and workshops oriented toward Latino parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VOCEROS also had multiple demands relating to campus buildings. The group asked for a guarantee that El Centro would remain a permanent space for Latinx students and also requested that an existing building in Manzanita Village be designated for Latinx students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc Fisher, a vice chancellor, said the university only plans to make routine modifications to the El Centro building over the next few decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can look out 5 or 10 or even 20 years and I can see what the next buildings are, and there are no plans for this site,” Fisher said.</span></p>\n<p>Administrators also responded in favor of dedicating an existing building in Manzanita Village to Latinx students. While housing is already determined for next year, Klawunn said, there could be a Latinx-specific building by fall 2017.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that while it can be “hard to build community” in Manzanita Village as opposed to the standard freshman dorms like Anacapa or San Nicolas, he didn’t think there would be much resistance to the Manzanita Village idea if that is what students desire.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB Police Chief Dustin Olson also attended the meeting, promising to meet with students and possibly other local police agencies by fall to discuss reducing the “footprint” of law enforcement at events like Deltopia or during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Olson also said the department will “definitely be committed and continue to be committed to sensitivity to gender and diversity” in hiring practices.</p>\n<p>Both students and administrators were willing to work with each other and appeared relieved by the productive nature of the talks.</p>\n<p>“It’s Saturday, we should be relaxing … but I’m here meeting with you all and that’s because these things are very important and these are things that affect people’s lives,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“At other UCs you have to literally protest for days just to get [the administrators’] attention,” she continued. “So the fact that we didn’t have to do that is a blessing in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>The full list of VOCEROS demands is available as part of the group’s <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/chancellor-henry-yang-voceros-reforms?recruiter=308498257&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink\">online petition to Chancellor Yang.</a></p>\n<p><em>[Correction, May 23: An initial version of this article said students met with administrators in El Centro for three hours on Saturday.

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>A guest speaker for the UCSB Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) on Wednesday spoke against commonly held beliefs regarding sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Guest Speaker Andrew Cavarno, a fourth-year history major and member of Young Americans for Liberty, argued that a frequently referenced statistic of one in four women being sexually assaulted on college campuses is heavily inflated and lacking in evidence.</p>\n<p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses,” Cavarno said. “The word epidemic implies that there’s a sudden wave of sexual violence, or that things are getting worse – this is just not the case.”</p>\n<p>YAL originally intended the event to be a panel discussion featuring speakers from differing sides of the argument. Pointing to an empty chair beside him, Cavarno emphasized that no one with an opposing view was present to make the case for the statistic, even after having sent out “hundreds of emails.”</p>\n<p>“Why is that chair empty?” Cavarno asked, “If all the evidence is truly on that side, if it is beyond reproach, if there’s no reason to debate this, then why is this chair empty?”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that while sexual assault on campuses is an important issue, the current system infringes upon due process rights.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of the numbers, we still have to have a system that works,” Cavarno said. “Regardless of whether its one in five or one in 50, we still need a system that allows survivors to receive support but also a system that does not infringe on the due process rights of accused students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses.” — Andrew Cavarno</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cavarno criticized a study conducted by the Association of American Universities, stating that it had a sample with an “extraordinarily low response rate” and an “over-broad definition of sexual assault.” He also argued that the study does not distinguish between acts of sexual assault and acts of sexual battery.</p>\n<p>“Both sexual assault and sexual battery are inexcusable, but they are not the same kind of action,” Cavarno said. “The one in five statistic on the other hand uses definitions that fail to distinguish between a girl getting her ass grabbed at a party and being forcibly penetrated, or having someone have sex with her when she is incapacitated.”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that the way schools handle sexual assault often ruins the careers and social lives of men by unfairly branding them as rapists. Cavarno then wrapped up his speech saying “feminism teaches the notion that men are not deserving of empathy,” concluding that “schools should not adjudicate sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>James Cornell, fourth-year electrical engineering major and Vice President of Young Americans for Liberty, said the speech was “very factual and academic.”</p>\n<p>“I think [the statistic] paints a very bad image of males in society and males on college campuses,” Cornell said. “It instills a lot of fear into women so they don’t feel safe on college campuses where they should be.”</p>\n<p>Katia Stern, a second-year financial math and statistics major, said that inflated statistics devalue the instances of more heinous cases of rape.</p>\n<p>“I think if the statistic is over-exaggerated it sort of devalues the worst cases of the rape, and it makes it seem like it’s a lot more prevalent and we start to consider really minor accusations in the compass of the broader definition of rape,” Stern said. “It kind of diminishes the value of individuals who are brutally raped.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a first-year anthropology major, who asked to remain anonymous, said universities should support victims of  sexual assault by providing programs like Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (CARE) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that it’s wrong for universities to be involved in advocating for victims of sexual assault,” she said. “I was sexually assaulted as a minor and I feel like the system that I had before university has utterly failed me, and I feel like it’s very important to have CARE and CAPs and for this university to be very strict on people who are accused.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71213\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71213\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/","id":2483,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2482,2481,2480],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":48,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
