They attributed all of this to the disruption in their pay, an issue they said plagued both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>\n<p>âWhen we are unable to fulfill our financial obligations as students, such as paying tuition and fees, we are penalized,â UAW member Mariah Clegg said, reading the letter to Yang and other administration members seated around the table.</p>\n<p>âWhy shouldnât the university be held accountable for compensating workers for the losses caused by its failure to pay workers on time?â</p>\n<p>UAW presented several demands to the administration in their letter, the most urgent of which asked UCSB to pay all workers what they are owed by Feb. 1.</p>\n<p>âA lot of people are told that someone is working on it, but itâs not always clear what that means, if thereâs any sort of timeline,â Lisa August-Schmidt, sergeant at arms on the UAW Statewide Executive Board, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>âIn general, what Iâve found to be incredibly frustrating in dealing with the university via Labor Relations or directly, [is that] theyâve been really unwilling to acknowledge how big of a problem this is.â</p>\n<p>Administrators continually noted throughout the meeting that while they knew about the pay problems and had been actively working to fix them, they had been unaware of many of the ripple effects of the delayed pay. They thanked the members for bringing it to their attention.</p>\n<p>Marshall admitted there was a âflaw in the designâ of UCPath and said the administration was working to help address studentsâ grievances.</p>\n<p>âWeâre meeting about this every week and trying to make it work,â he said during the meeting. âI think weâve made some progress, but every new payday is another test of the system.â</p>\n<p>The union members shared personal anecdotes regarding their own experiences with UCPath to emphasize the urgency of the problem.</p>\n<p>One member said she had been overpaid by $900 during Fall Quarter 2018. After returning the money then, she said she received a letter on Jan. 15 saying that she needed to pay the money back by Jan. 14, or it would be sent to collections.</p>\n<p>âOn top of missing pay, many workers were faced with credit card late fees, unexpectedÂ transportation costs when bus passes were denied due to late fee remission, and were forced to skip meals to make ends meet. One workerâs car was repossessed for not making timely payments,â the letter stated.</p>\n<p>UAW representatives and administrators agreed that communication was one of the largest issues exacerbating the payment issues; both noted that there was not one office that students could approach if they were experiencing payment issues.</p>\n<p>One of UAWâs demands was to establish a single point of contact âso that workersâ problems do not have to go through multiple bureaucratic layers before coming to the attention of UCPath,â the letter stated.</p>\n<p>Throughout the meeting, Yang asked his administrators about what issues could be solved immediately, expressing concern that there were still students not being paid on time, leaving them unable to pay rent.</p>\n<p>He was especially thrown off by the figure listed in the letter, which stated that ânone of the thirty-some tutors and readers in the Accounting program were paid at all during fall quarter as a result of complications with UCPath.â</p>\n<p>Since its implementation at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, UCPath, a program aimed at streamlining the way all UC workers get paid, has caused an uproar among student workers at UC campuses, primarily graduate students.</p>\n<p>The union first filed a grievance regarding UCPath issues on Oct. 19, according to August-Schmidt. The union put out a survey on Oct. 8 regarding UC Pathâs issues; they have received over 500 responses across the UC system so far.</p>\n<p>One of the difficulties with the new system is that it consolidated payroll at UC Riverside, meaning that individual campuses had less power to address any issues that emerged.</p>\n<p>UAW workers at UCSB felt that the deployment of UCPath at other campuses should be delayed until the full scope of problems it has caused has been solved.</p>\n<p>âThere hasnât really been a satisfying acknowledgment of the kind of havoc this creates in peopleâs lives,â August-Schmidt said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Feb. 2]</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com.

There could be some hesitation. That hesitation could be coming from different places, but to see these types of events is an opportunity to learn more about immigrant experiences,â Diana Ordorica, UCSBâs USS coordinator, said.</p>\n<p>The allyship-based event encouraged attendees to put up posters supporting undocumented students in their workspaces, rooms or social media pages.</p>\n<p>âIn the past weâve had presentations to update folks about whatâs going on with immigration. Weâve had trainings for staff, faculty and graduate students,â Ordorica said. This training-oriented experience pursued in the past was once again employed during this yearâs Immigration Awareness Week through the second major event of the annual occasion.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 24, a workshop in the Student Resource Building, titled âUndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Training,â promoted a holistic approach to supporting queer and transgender undocumented students. It was open to graduate students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>While partially informational, the workshop also contributed to the visibility of LGBTQIA+ immigrant students through the sharing of stories and experiences from individuals well-acquainted with the struggles of the queer immigration experience.</p>\n<p>âWith the current administration that we have, immigration is right at the forefront of everything,â Dwayne Mosbey, RCSGD program coordinator, said. âItâs very important for someone who is working with the LGBTQ community to be working with all of these intersecting communities and these intersecting identities that students may have.â</p>\n<p>With this sentiment in mind, the âUndocuQueer and UndocuTransâ training session featured guest speakers who gave attendees descriptions of firsthand experiences from undocumented, LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>\n<p>âAs progressive as a school UCSB is, I think folks have a lot of presumptions about communities that theyâre unfamiliar with, so this is an opportunity for those who are allies to make themselves more well-known for those who arenât as educated or as well-knowledged about the subject to finally get that kind of information,â Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>According to Mosbey, events like âUndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Trainingâ are meant âto create visibility for students and members of the community who are a part of the undocumented community â for them to feel like folks care about them and that they have clear support here on campus.â</p>\n<p>To conclude Immigration Awareness Week, an open house for UCSBâs Immigration Legal Services was held on Jan. 25 to further highlight the resources available to undocumented immigrant students. The open house, held in the Annex, offered advice from Managing Attorney Vivek Mittal, Attorney Ron Perry and other advisors who make up the Immigration Legal team at UCSB.</p>\n<p>âThis week is shining the spotlight for a moment, but itâs â more than anything â igniting a movement to continue on through this year,â Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>âI want folks who are allies or folks who are not as knowledgeable about the subject to come to Immigration Awareness Week, take the information in, analyze within themselves what kind of internalized presumptions they may have, challenge those presumptions and then continue to uplift these communities that have be ingrained in America since its conception.â</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:56 a.m.]</i></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</i></p>\n<p><i>Nyah Scott is a reporter at the Daily Nexus</i><em> and can be reached at news@daliynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

The class required students to design petitions based on their personal passions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Karmes-Wainer, that passion was healthy eating. Her health journey over the past year inspired her to make healthy eating options more accessible for UCSB students as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">âI donât believe that we have enough restaurants or establishments to build healthy, nutritious meals, and even if they seem healthy, theyâre not always the healthiest option,â Karmes-Wainer said. Â </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer used the petition as a way to gauge the communityâs response to the hot bar as a potential senate project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What first began as a class project quickly transformed into a platform for students with a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences to voice their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">âI engaged people from other communities that I didnât realize that I was targeting as well,â Karmes-Wainer said. âThatâs the point of my position, is to hear from all my different constituents.â </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainerâs petition elicited plenty of responses from its post on UCSBâs Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Moser, a fourth-year environmental studies major at UCSB, said his dietary restrictions made finding food on campus difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">âBeing a celiac, itâs hard to find many gluten-free meal options on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">â </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just random misc snack items.

percent of the student body, or 1,783 people, must vote for the special election to be valid, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting on Wednesday. This requirement has been lowered several times to compensate for low voting turnouts in the previous Fall Quarter External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 612 students have voted. With only a week until voting closes, the election is still over 1,000 votes away from meeting the eight percent requirement.</p>\n<p>Initially, two students declared candidacy in the special election: Rachel Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, and Richard Zierer, a fourth-year political science and English double major. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Jan. 23, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>If the election meets the eight percent threshold, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ng-is-sole-candidate-remaining-in-evpsa-special-election/#search\">center her agenda</a> around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>To meet the voter threshold, Ng plans to utilize social media and class announcements. She believes that the lack of voter turnout in the previous EVPSA elections was due to voter burnout.</p>\n<p>This is A.S.âs third attempt to elect an EVPSA since Spring Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>A fall quarter special election occurred due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification of Mayela Morales</a>, a fifth-year global studies and Chicano and Chicana studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the EVPSA position in April, but she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, resulting in her subsequent disqualification.</p>\n<p>Madeline Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, was the sole declared candidate in the Fall Quarter special election. During that special election, however, the 16 percent voter threshold was not met and as a result, Loudon was not voted in.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board spent $50 on the Winter Quarter special election, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Voting for the winter special election opened on Thursday, Jan. 24. Voting closes on Thursday, Feb. 7, and results will be announced that evening.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at simren@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.Â </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

They have also been setting up social media accounts and inviting students to attend general meetings.</p>\n<p>âOur goal for the end of this quarter is weâre gonna have the people who continue with us during the general meetings to learn how to research and dive into special collections,â Woo said.</p>\n<p>âTheyâre all gonna have an article hopefully produced at the end of the quarter and then weâre gonna have a little launch party for the website.â</p>\n<p>They hope to generate more content for the website by the end of the quarter as well, mentioning that it can take a while to sort through various sources of information and find people to interview.</p>\n<p>âWe are working on talking to members of the community, or people who used to be a part of the UCSB community and just getting their side of the story,â Hoang added. âWeâre really trying to find the miniscule details that people donât necessarily know about.â</p>\n<p>Woo said that they hope that they can eventually become a reliable source of information for students interested in learning more about the history of activism on campus.</p>\n<p>One of the first articles published on the new website was about one of the most famous events in Isla Vista history: the burning of the Bank of America building.</p>\n<p>âWhen we go into special collections, thereâs a lot of like weird information from old newspapersâ¦ Itâs just insane to see all the events that have happened in I.V. history,â Woo said.</p>\n<p>âI know in general about some of them but reading firsthand accounts, like the Bank of America burning, which I did an article on, I researched a lot of what happened and â can I swear? â that shit was fucking insane!â</p>\n<p>Woo said she started with the bank burning because it was a topic she knew there would be a lot of information on, but students who join the Living History Project would have discretion in choosing what to cover.</p>\n<p>âThe whole of student activism at UCSB is so big,â she added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85923\" style=\"width: 1940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/living-history-project-revived-by-dedicated-second-years/screen-shot-2019-01-31-at-12-21-30-am/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-85923\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85923\" data-attachment-id=\"85923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/living-history-project-revived-by-dedicated-second-years/screen-shot-2019-01-31-at-12-21-30-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=1930%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1930,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-01-31 at 12.21.30 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85923\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=888%2C594\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?w=1930&amp;ssl=1 1930w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Woo and Hoang have created several templates for student collaborators interested in doing this research. The first is a boards, commissions and units (BCU) and student organization bio, which would detail the origins of a student organization on campus and the social climate in which it developed.</p>\n<p>The second gathers personal testimonials about notable points of I.V. history, like the Bank of America burning, and the third creates timelines of topics like womenâs organizing throughout UCSB history.</p>\n<p>âWeâre making it so open because we want people to pursue a topic that theyâre passionate about, so that way they can learn more about it and be passionate about when theyâre writing, and thatâll show through their work too,â Woo said.</p>\n<p>As they begin to work with other students, they hope to expand the kind of work that they present on the website and help students pursue what theyâre interested in.</p>\n<p>âResearch can take form and be represented in a number of ways.

Student activism happens every day and history is living, itâs constant, so we hope that we can get more information out there to students at UCSB.â</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 31, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. newsÂ editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com or news@daliynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Nick Song / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Greek life at UCSB over the past four years has been marked by the closing of several chapters of fraternities by their parent organizations, as well as a loss of standing among the campus community at UCSB.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity lost its standing with UCSB due to ârisk management violations of the campusâs alcohol-free social event policy.â It still operates without the consent of the university.</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â The sorority Alpha Kappa Delta Phi was closed by its headquarters due to ârisk management violations and hazing.â</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Beta Theta Pi (Beta) was closed by its parent organization due to ârisk management violations and hazing.â</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity (NAK) closed after it was charged with ârisk management violations in conjunction with sexual harassment/sexual assault.â</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Phi Delta Theta Colony (Phi Delt) left campus due to ârisk management violations,â which its parent organization felt were âincongruent with headquarter policies and values.â</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity (Phi Sig) closed due to risk management violations, hazing and sexual harassment/sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Â Â Â Â Delta Delta Delta Sorority (Tri Delta) will close in June 2019 due to decreased membership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to both students involved in Greek Life through the Interfraternity Council (IFC) as well as staff in the Office of Student Life (OSL), recent developments indicate improvement.</p>\n<p>Emma Parker, a scheduling systems manager representing the Office of the Dean of Students at UCSB, wrote that the Greek-lettered organizations at UCSB have âmade great strides in the last few years toward building a safer, more responsible community through education, student-led initiatives, and programming.â</p>\n<p>OSL Director Miles Ashlock also noted different approaches from both the student and administrative sides.</p>\n<p>âWe did have a rash of really serious, high-profile cases, which I think attracted a lot of attention,â Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>âProbably people realized that âhey, if the university is taking these steps then there must be something really concerning; we really need to look out for ourselves and each other, and take better care.ââ</p>\n<p>Ashlock said student leaders within Greek organizations have taken more initiative in fostering relationships with administration.</p>\n<p>âI think we have seen some significant developments in terms of student leaders stepping up to create internal policies and procedures that contribute to the safety and better operation of their organizations. They have been a lot more open with us in terms of disclosing concerns, asking questions and proposing solutions,â he said.</p>\n<p>OSL has overhauled the way that staff members interact with those affiliated with Greek life, giving the Greek organizations more opportunities to interact with a wider variety of people in the office.</p>\n<p>âWe started to cross-train, so rather than have a separate unit involving fraternities and sororities, work is divided among multiple people, so fraternities and sororities get to know pretty much everyone,â Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Having closer relationships with a broader scope of staff has given Greek life âa lot more opportunities to interact and a lot of opportunity for [OSL] to connect with them across our program areas with other campus organizations and leadership development,â he added.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said there are broader shifts in the demographics of the university which reflect in the conduct of fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>âIâm heartened to see the demographics of our campus more closely reflect the demographics of the state,â he said.</p>\n<p>âWhat I see is an ever-increasing emphasis on school and studies and people seeing the value of education over maybe what was the in the â80s or â90s the perceived âcoming-of-age experience in college.ââ</p>\n<p>UCSB IFC President Zachary Hedges noted that the IFC, in cooperation with other Greek councils, has worked to develop an accreditation program.</p>\n<p>The program includes workshops that aim to âhelp students improve their well-being and learn to recognize and prevent the potentially dangerous situations that are most common.â</p>\n<p>Ongoing collaboration with campus organizations such as Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), Alcohol and Drug Program (ADP) and Campus Advocacy, Resources, &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), have helped ensure that these workshops remain ârelevant and engaging,â Hedges said.</p>\n<p>âThe IFC is also a strong advocate of making sure that all of our members are encouraged to report sexual assault and understand the options available to them in order to do so.â</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appear on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

and develop tangible action in a community. It will be offered only through the UCSB extension program.</p>\n<p>Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager and Santa Barbara City College trustee, designed the course. He will be teaching it this spring with the help of occasional guest speakers.</p>\n<p>Abboud recently submitted a tentative syllabus for the class in the form of a proposal, which, if approved, will allow him to the class to run next quarter.</p>\n<p>âIâm really looking forward to it because I know it is going to be hard this first time doing it, but it is a way for me to pass on what Iâve learned,â Abboud said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>This is not his first experience teaching a course at UCSB, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>In Winter Quarter 2014, he taught a course called âPolitics of the University of Californiaâ where students learned about the inner workings of the university and its role on a statewide platform.</p>\n<p>On top of teaching at UCSB, Abboud also has experience in the area of grassroots campaigning, which he developed both in and out of school.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Abboud launched multiple successful grassroots campaigns, which ultimately led to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/csd-takes-first-steps-in-i-v-governance/\">formation of I.V. CSD</a>.</p>\n<p>The director of UCSBâs Leadership and Advocacy Program, Patricia Fancher, initially approached Abboud to create a syllabus and teach a class on campaign design.</p>\n<p>Although the course name implies campaigning, that is not necessarily what the class is about, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>âWhen people use the word campaigning, they probably mean going out and getting votes, but thatâs not what this class is forâ¦ The class is about how to build support for your idea and advance it.â</p>\n<p>The class will take place over 10 weeks, during which students will work toward creating a campaign portfolio. The portfolio will include a plan to campaign either on campus or in I.V. âto enact some positive changeâ in their respective communities, according to the syllabus proposal.</p>\n<p>Each week of the class will highlight a different component of the campaigning process â ranging from volunteer recruitment to branding and communications â in order add more tools to studentsâ campaigning belts, according to the syllabus.</p>\n<p>The course is structured similarly to that of most courses at UCSB, but places a heavier emphasis on technical skills and less on theories, said Abboud.</p>\n<p>âThe class does have some theory in it, but a lot of it is going to be more practical skills based, like how to facilitate a meeting or how to do a power map. Hopefully people can take the things they learn in their theory classes and see how they relate to this.â</p>\n<p>Although the class doesnât begin until April, Abboud has high hopes along with some nerves.</p>\n<p>âIâve had some experience to make this less scary than it can be, but it definitely is an exciting opportunity.â</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

to speak about her experience as Secretary of State and her take on foreign policy, among other things.</p>\n<p>Albright explained that her father faced roadblocks seeking political asylum in the U.S. during the McCarthy Era, as he had to explain that the government he once worked under was openly communist. This extreme governmental scrutiny delayed a young Albrightâs path to citizenship until the summer between her sophomore and junior years at Wellesley College.</p>\n<p>Albright expressed the importance of written immigration policy ââ an issue that currently divides the executive and legislative branches in a record-breaking government shutdown.</p>\n<p>âWe could be more generous in our lawsâ¦We have a lot of room [in the country],â she said to a room of thunderous applause.</p>\n<p>She expressed support and empathy for those supported by the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAMers), noting that the bartering of their livelihoods are a âparticularly sad aspectâ of the immigration crisis.</p>\n<p>âWe have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep,â she said during the speech.</p>\n<p>Albright also praised UC Santa Barbara for being one of the first universities to offer a Global Studies major. Though she expressed her concerns for the current state of American foreign policy ââ and emphasized that the rest of the world would not wait for the United States to get its act together ââ she remained optimistic that students at the university would learn to think beyond stereotypes and borders.</p>\n<p>Albright praised students who opted to study abroad or those whose majors contain an emphasis on the relationship between culture and ethics.</p>\n<p>âSeeds nourished in a multicultural classroom have a way of blossomingâ¦ This is a key to real leadership.â</p>\n<p>A common theme in Albrightâs talk was a sense of prevailing hope for the future. Citing a round-table discussion earlier in the day with members of the UCSB Letters &amp; Science Honors Program, she spoke with delight about the ferocity of the students she had conversed with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">âWe have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She cited weakness at the core of the political system, not only with the downfall of the American presidency, but with the disastrous Brexit deal as well. The fall of democracy, she claimed, allows fascism to creep its way back into the public eye.</p>\n<p>âAs the worldâs democracies dither, [nationalist movements] scale the ramparts,â she said, referencing rising totalitarian states like Russia, Syria, Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>\n<p>This rising hyper-nationalism is caused by a combination of globalization and technology, Albright added: â[These trends] are double-edged swords.â</p>\n<p>The issue with globalization, she said, is that it is faceless. She views technology as a more difficult issue to unpack, as she believes it has caused much beneficial change, but also noted that it has put so many skilled laborers out of work.</p>\n<p>Social media combines these two factors, and in the hands of demagogues, becomes a tool of unwieldy fascism, Albright said. She claims social media âallows demagogues to build bonfiresâ out of hatred, and with the technological advancements of a worldwide platform, the spread of fascism has become that much simpler.</p>\n<p>When asked by moderator Jeff Greenfield how she explains the behavior of President Trump to foreigners, Albright became visibly restrained.</p>\n<p>âI find it very, very painfulâ¦There is no logic. It is confusing to our allies as well as our adversaries.â</p>\n<p>Yet, Albright wholeheartedly encouraged people to run for office and to engage in dialogues across the aisle.</p>\n<p>âI donât like the word tolerance,â she said, claiming instead that she is partial to its friendlier counterpart ârespect.â</p>\n<p>She referenced her morning commute to Georgetown University, driving through the streets of Washington, D.C. as she listens to right wing radio. Though it may cause her to, as she puts it, âpose a certain risk to pedestrians,â she also said it was beneficial for her bipartisan philosophy to gain a deeper understanding of both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>âAlthough now confused for an eccentric Uber driver, I was once Secretary of State.â</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85780\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright-shares-optimism-at-granada-theatre/eveningwithma-22012019-angelicabanks-9/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-85780\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85780\" data-attachment-id=\"85780\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright-shares-optimism-at-granada-theatre/eveningwithma-22012019-angelicabanks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanksâ9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85780\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>There were approximately a 100 people in attendance; some, such as UCSB second-year political science and global studies double major Alex Young, were impressed with Albrightâs visit to the Granada.</p>\n<p>However, Young said he was disappointed that she showed restraint when speaking about current political affairs.</p>\n<p>âI think Secretary Albright has a really interesting history and has done great workâ¦a lot other answers were really indirect but I respect her for staying neutral in domestic affairs and speaking to changes on the international stage.â</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and French double major Emma Wiley was one of the few honors students present during Albrightâs roundtable discussion earlier in the day with UCSB students. She agreed that Albright was far more restrained during her prepared remarks.</p>\n<p>âYou can tell that she genuinely feels passion for the United States,â Wiley added.</p>\n<p>Not all were happy with Albrightâs visit to the Granada, however. A handful of protestors â including approximately 20 members of the Student Activist Network and the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective â stood outside the building during Albrightâs speech chanting, âWhose streets?â âOur streets!â and âWhose blood?â âAlbrightâs blood!â</p>\n<p>Protesters held signs with slogans such as: âAlbright gave the green light for the Rwandan Genocideâ and âNo war mongers in Santa Barbara.â</p>\n<p>In a statement referring to Albright as âa neo-imperialist hawk widely accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity,â the Student Activist Network encouraged UCSB to âredirect its resources to public figures committed to transforming the unjust and untenable political and economic order that Former Secretary of State Albright exemplifies.â</p>\n<p>âThe fact that she has written a book about resisting fascism is incredibly ironic because she paved the way for the rise of fascism in this country and in many other countries that the United States supported during her time in office,â Prathik Raghu, one of the organizers of the protest, said.</p>\n<p>Though Raghu, a teaching assistant within the UCSB Global Studies Department, sees Albright as an adversary to President Trump, this does not mean that this exonerates her from âhaving blood on her hands.â</p>\n<p><em>Hannah Jackson is an asst. opinion editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at opinion@dailynexus.com.Â </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.Â </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Wednesday morning, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>The last student to hold the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/\">Kristin Hsu</a>, who focused much of her term on decreasing tuition during a time when the University of California Regents were threatening a tuition increase due to lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng, a fourth-year global studies and biological sciences double major, plans to go in a different direction than Hsu.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to center her agenda around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>âIâm more interested in increasing the amount of resources we have on campus,â Ng said.</p>\n<p>One of her goals is to ensure that the newly created Survivor Resource Center in Isla Vista receives funding âin order to have the branchâ¦ be all that it can be.â</p>\n<p>âI really would be pushing for increased access to sexual assault resources,â Ng added.</p>\n<p>She also plans to advocate for stricter gun control policies, and was one of the organizers for Santa Barbaraâs March for Our Lives.</p>\n<p>âIâm from Thousand Oaks,â Ng said. âIt both personally touches me, and itâs also one of those things that shouldnât be contentious.â</p>\n<p>Ng previously lobbied for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/state-senator-reintroduces-bill-to-ensure-medication-abortion-access-at-public-universities/\">Senate Bill 24</a>, formerly Senate Bill 320, which would require all public university campuses, including UC Santa Barbara, to provide access to medication abortion services to students.</p>\n<p>âWe luckily now have a governor whoâs willing to pass it, so Iâve been really advocating for that,â Ng said.</p>\n<p>In terms of the EVPSAâs job to represent the student body on larger platforms, Ng believes that UCSB deserves a stronger voice in both the United States Student Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>âWe fund the vast majority of both of those entities,â Ng said. âIf weâre the ones funding a lot of it, that means UC Santa Barbara should be up there with a really loud voice.â</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng plans to attend every A.S. Senate meeting to inform senators of relevant legislation.</p>\n<p>Ng started out her first year at UCSB involved in the Residential Housing Association as a Project Care Director.</p>\n<p>In her second year, Ng was an officer of Los Curanderos, which is a pre-med club on campus that is meant to focus on âdisadvantaged communities who donât have access to equal healthcare.â</p>\n<p>At the beginning of her third year, she joined the Associated Students (A.S.)

President Brooke Kopel had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">appointed</a> four members to the council after <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/a-s-postpones-council-vote-for-second-week/\">concerns</a> about conflicts of interest plagued her choice for the position of chair, current council member Justin Nilsen.</p>\n<p>According to Alonso, the council internally determined that Alonso was the best decision for chair.</p>\n<p>Alonso spoke about his plans for the position of chair at Wednesdayâs meeting and in an interview with the Nexus, highlighting his interest in âbroadening the accessibility of Judicial Council.â</p>\n<p>He plans to do so in two ways: by reaching out to various boards, commissions and units (BCUs) on campus and by introducing more empathy in judicial council proceedings.</p>\n<p>âWhen it comes to the judicial process, what often gets left out are the struggles of individuals from various communities, and that allows other people to misinterpret or misunderstand the decisions of other individuals that may have made necessary a judicial council case,â he said in the interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>âI want to do this in order to really give people who might not be as easily understood the ability to be understood.â</p>\n<p>He noted that, while the council is âalright, in terms of a diverse body,â there is always more that can be done to make the judicial process more equitable.</p>\n<p>Alonso said he also wants to work with various BCUs to increase their involvement and understanding of A.S. Legal Code, and wants to encourage them to reach out to the council if they have any concerns about legal code violations.</p>\n<p>âAlmost every body of Associated Students violates legal code, accidentally, or on purpose, but usually accidentally. We want to make ourselves known to other people, like hey, if something is happening in your BCU which violates legal code and you donât like this, we have legal code for a reason, and thatâs something that you can come to us about,â he added.</p>\n<p>By gaining a better understanding of A.S. Legal Code, organizations can operate in the most efficient manner, Alonso said, which is his ultimate goal with the Council.</p>\n<p>âIâve gone to a few BCU meetings myself, the bodies are great, and they have these brilliant missions, but because they arenât super informed on legal code, they get stuck in a lot ofâ¦ bureaucratic red tape,â he said.</p>\n<p>âIt just really paralyzes action, and I want people to have the best understanding of legal code because it was designed very specifically to allow A.S. to function, not to prevent it from functioning.â</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Senate Wednesday evening, Alonso fielded questions about how he would address conflicts of interest and potential biases that could crop up.</p>\n<p>In response, Alonso affirmed that he was committed to transparency, both amongst council members and from himself. Alonso also noted that last spring, when the council encountered a case where he had a conflict of interest, he immediately recused himself from the discussion.</p>\n<p>Alonso also said the council has been discussing possible bias trainings that they could undergo in order to make the judicial proceedings as fair and understanding as they can be.</p>\n<p>Internally, Alonso plans on revamping the Councilâs office space in order for them to be able to hear cases in their office, instead of spending the bulk of their minimal budget on renting out spaces to hear cases.</p>\n<p>He also plans to make the process of submitting a petition more clear by creating a Google form with mandatory questions, noting that petitions that were submitted last spring were bogged down with technicalities and are now being dealt with over six months later.</p>\n<p>Making the office as efficient as it can be is Alonsoâs goal for his time as chair, but itâs also important to him to introduce an aspect of warmth to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>âIt is important that all people within UCSB are able to feel safe and comfortable and know that the Association has their back.â</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Participants are expected to budget accordingly so that their funds will endure through the month of February. Â </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CalFresh Team also outlined a short list of important reminders for students already enrolled in or intending to enroll in the CalFresh program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email urged participants intending to recertify to get their paperwork turned in as soon as possible so that theyâll be able to receive their early allotments for the month of February.

UCSB employees. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to do so, written by Off-Campus Senators Dallin Mello and Christian Ornelas, calls upon the University of California to implement a cost-of-living adjustment and increase the current minimum wage. It also directs UC Santa Barbaraâs Associated Students (A.S.) to raise its workersâ pay to $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 322 students employed by A.S., and 33 career employees, according to Ornelas.Â </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello and Ornelas noted in the resolution that the UC had implemented a policy in 2013 that raised the minimum wage for UC employees to $15 in 2013, but that it only applied to those who worked at least 20 hours a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ââ¦at many UC campuses, students are prohibited from working more than 19 hours per week, thereby systematically preventing them from qualifying for a raise under this policy,â the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution demands that the $15 minimum wage be applied to all UC workers, regardless of the number of hours that they work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with supporting a systemwide cost-of-living raise, the resolution also directs A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez to work with Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez and President Brooke Kopel to increase wages for students employed by A.S. UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution mandates that yearly A.S. budgets from now onward should account for the increased wages and directs the UC Human Resources department to âperform an upward reclassificationâ of UCSB employees to ensure that their minimum salary meets the living minimum wage policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Human Resources department declines to do so or does not respond to the resolution within two weeks, the Senate will provide honoraria for A.S. UCSB employees to ensure their final pay amounts to at least $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate also plans to pass a resolution stating that âASUCSB has no confidence with University of Californiaâs ability to fairly treat ASUCSB employeesâ if Human Resources does not accommodate the requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators discussed where the funding would come from during Wednesday eveningâs meeting, clarifying that student fees would not be raised in order to increase A.S. UCSB wages. Instead, funds within the current budget would be reallocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though several senators argued that it would be unfair to prioritize A.S. UCSB workers with this raise when many students have other on-campus jobs or work in I.V., Ornelas referred to this motion as a âstepping stoneâ with the hope of setting the tone for other organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">âInstead of waiting for [the university] to do somethingâ¦ we should start and let them follow us with everything that we do,â On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon was the only one to abstain from the vote, stating they strongly supported the resolution but could not vote due to a conflict of interest because they worked at the A.S.

The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would receive support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District finalized an agreement during its Jan. 8 meeting to open a survivor resource center in Isla Vista in collaboration with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault, a organization addressing sexual assault in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) President Emily Montalvo-Telford said the new center would make it easier for survivors to meet with a Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) representative and receive immediate counseling. The center will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>The center will provide a place in I.V. where survivors can receive medical attention, make a police report and obtain an emergency protective order. Previously, survivors would only have access to these services at STESAâs location in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Survivors will also be able to obtain emergency services such as food, shelter and transportation. The center will also have the resources to help survivors apply for U Visas and T Visas, Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>U visas are non-immigrant visas designed to aid victims of crime who have suffered physical or mental abuse in the U.S. and are assisting the investigation of the crime. T visas provide the same service to those who have suffered from human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The idea for a Survivor Resource Center in I.V. began with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">RoâShawndra Earvinâs 2017 Demands</a>, a list of 12 demands presented to Chancellor Yang after a 13 hour sit-in.</p>\n<p>Earvin, a former student at UCSB and advocate for sexual assault reforms, along with a large group of students, presented a list of 12 demands calling for sexual assault reform. The No. 1 demand on the list called for the creation of a survivor resource center.</p>\n<p>STESA, along with SASA and the I.V. CSD board members, have been collaborating over the past year in order to make the center a reality.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said work on the project first began in Spring 2018 when he was approached by Montalvo and Madeline Loudon, I.V. Community Coordinator for SASA. They presented to Brandt the lack of services for survivors of sexual assault provided by UCSB and said that the resource center would be a quick solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>âWe want to be a voice for survivors when there are injustices in the system,â Brandt said. âSo this, in particular, is an example of a supporting service.â</p>\n<p>Funding for the center primarily comes from the Measure R tax that was passed last year, granting the CSD a source of revenue for their projects.</p>\n<p>The survivor resource center will be located in a central location in I.V. and will be easily accessible for residents of the community, Montalvo said. To access the center, a survivor would need to call STESAâs hotline at (805) 564-3696, where they will be directed by an advocate to the center for aid.</p>\n<p>âDuring our budgeting process this year, it was a big priority for the budget committee to make a line item specifically for renovating this space so that it could become the survivor resource center,â Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Montalvo and Brandt both mentioned how rewarding it was to work with the various groups dedicated to resolving the issue of sexual assault in I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>âHonestly, this project was one of the smoothest that Iâve ever seen, especially when it comes to projects where Iâve worked with student groups on it, and that is really a testament to SASA and everything theyâve done. The same would go for STESA,â said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at theÂ </i>Daily NexusÂ <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez RiveraÂ is an asst. news editor at theÂ <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
