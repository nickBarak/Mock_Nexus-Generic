In addition to the relief resolution, senators listened to a presentation on student debt, postponed taking a stance on a UC worker strike and supported changes to the California Master Plan for Higher Education.  </p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nikki Calderon, who helped draft the resolution along with Off-campus Senator Beatrice Contreras, said there is a pressing need for more monetary allocations toward the relief fund, as she explained the nature of the catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“It’s estimated that there’s over 10,000 dead, and that’s just from the initial storm itself,” Calderon said. “This relief money is severely needed.”</p>\n<p>However, senators spent over an hour and a half feuding over the details of the bill, with some students not in favor of committing two hours of their week to help collect funds. In response, Contreras expressed exasperation with her peers.</p>\n<p>“I’m frustrated that this is taking so long,” Contreras said. “While we’re here debating this, there are literally people dying.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she felt it was unfair to other items on the agenda to spend such a disproportionate amount of time on the Typhoon resolution.</p>\n<p>“We spent over one hour on one resolution,” MacLachlan said. “And then the rest of the resolutions that were on the table, we only talked about for five or 10 minutes that were completely important … I think that we need to just remember that they all need their fair amount of distribution.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the resolution passed with a fundraising goal of $5,000, as proposed by On-campus Senator Colton Bentz.</p>\n<p>Amongst other items debated more briefly was a resolution in support of revising the current California Master Plan for Higher Education, which was first implemented in 1960. A.S. President Jonathan Abboud and External Vice President of Student Affairs Alex Choate advocated in favor of the revision at the meeting, pointing out the outdated goals of the current plan.  </p>\n<p>“I want to emphasize how important passing this resolution is,” Abboud said. “Please pass this, and if it’s passed, make a big deal about it.”</p>\n<p>Senators swiftly passed the resolution with little debate.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, Federal Policy Analyst Monte Richardson gave a short presentation on federal student loan debt, focusing on UCSB in particular.</p>\n<p>“In 2011, the average student load debt was $18,627 dollars, which is a little bit lower than the national average,” Richardson said. “The proportion of students with debt was 49 percent, which is a little bit less than half — just around the nation average.”</p>\n<p>A bill in support of UC workers on strike was tabled for a week due to a lack of data being provided, according to Off-campus Senator Nick Onyshko. Although senators are given a meeting agenda in advance so as to prepare accordingly, Onyshko said presenters should have provided more basic information to senators.</p>\n<p>“The lack of figures presented by the organizers was quite disconcerting,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Several other resolutions were quickly passed with little to no debate, including a resolution requesting check-ins between UCPD and the A.S. Senate, a resolution funding a university housing forum and minor updates to the legal codes for Human Rights Board and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>Other projects discussed at the meeting included new bike paths and racks and progress on the “Rate My Landlord” website, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53024\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53024\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/","id":3065,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3064,3063,3062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proposed Fundraising To Aid Philippine Relief Effort","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines last week and left roughly 2,300 dead, Associated Students will vote on a resolution to begin a fundraising event that will collect money every day at the A...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines last week and left roughly 2,300 dead, Associated Students will vote on a resolution to begin a fundraising event that will collect money every day at the Arbor, University Center and the lawn of the Student Resource Building from today until next Thursday.</p>\n<p>If passed, all donated funds will go directly to the National Alliance for Filipino Concerns, or NAFCON, a Seattle-based group that will send aid to a relief and rehabilitation organization with access to disaster victims. A.S. also plans to allow online donations through a PayPal account on their website, if donors are unable to give funds in person.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras, who is spearheading the resolution, said she was inspired to propose the resolution after hearing about the A.S. charity drive for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, through which A.S. raised $55,000. She also said she hopes the Filipino community on campus will help motivate relief efforts for the recent disaster, which has so far affected an estimated 9.5 million people.</p>\n<p>“I was inspired to do this because we have a significant Filipino population at UCSB and many people have family members that live in areas hit by the typhoon,” Contreras, a sociology and Asian American studies double major, said.</p>\n<p>Working together with campus Filipino organization Kapatirang Pilipino, also known as “Filipino Brotherhood/Sisterhood,” Associated Students hopes to raise $25,000 in student donations, which they will then match with their own funds, bringing the total goal up to $50,000, if the resolution passes.</p>\n<p>Although funds raised would typically go to the Red Cross chapter of the Philippines, A.S. Senator and second-year political science and communication double major Nikki Calderon, who is co-sponsoring the resolution, said this will not be the case since the Red Cross chapter has a reputation for misusing funds.</p>\n<p>“The Philippines’ Red Cross was objected to be used by the Filipino community here because in past years, it had been discovered that [this chapter] was stealing funds for employee personal use and the money was not being sent as aid,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said the only relief organization that currently has access to most of the affected areas is UNICEF. However, only two military planes have been able to land in the region surrounding Tacloban — the worst-hit city — so far, meaning aid is arriving very slowly. As a result, Calderon said Associated Students needs to expedite the fundraising process in order to deliver donations to victims as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>For students like first-year biology major Nila Nathan, UCSB students have a duty to support populations abroad that are underprivileged or suffering from natural disasters.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s vital to donate because we are lucky to have so much, and it’s important to show those who are less fortunate that we care,” Nathan said.</p>\n<p>In an effort to raise additional funds for relief efforts, Kapatirang Pilipino plans to host an event called “The Benefit Open Mic Night” next Monday at the MultiCultural Center Theater. For those unable to donate money, the organization will also be accepting clothing, blankets and other necessities on the second floor of Embarcadero Hall next Monday through Friday.</p>\n<p>UCSB alum and New Student Requirement Coordinator for the Alcohol and Drug Program Marjan Riazi, who is spearheading the clothing and blanket drive, said she was motivated to create the event when she learned that some of her own family members were affected by the typhoon.</p>\n<p>“Our land was destroyed, but even worse is the fact that the homes of our 40 farmers and their families have been destroyed,” Riazi said. “These people literally have nothing. They are waiting for safety, but even after this storm subsides, they still have to pick up the pieces and rebuild all of their homes.”</p>\n<p>In light of such drastic circumstances and suffering, Riazi said relief efforts will be long and strenuous, so she is working to build support on campus and offer as much aid as possible.</p>\n<p>“This is going to be over a year-long process and this is only one story,” she said. “There are millions of people suffering in the Philippines so I feel more than obligated to do my part and help in whatever way I can.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, November 14, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/","id":3066,"author":{"id":194,"name":"Chelsea Brandwein"},"related":[3065,3064,3063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition, the executive officers delivered reports updating the Senate on news from their offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President for Local Affairs Alex Moore briefly recapped Halloween, saying this year’s festivities were milder than anticipated.</p>\n<p>“It was overall a smaller Halloween than we thought,” Moore said. “For a Thursday night Halloween, it was really kind of controlled.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud addressed the Senate regarding his recent meeting with the campus planning committee, expressing frustration at the resistance he encountered towards his plans for a UCen renovation.</p>\n<p>“Our project is $25 million and there were other projects that are $150 million and our project was the only one that was questioned and criticized,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>He said the university is in “critical” need of “a student services building that provides much-needed resources,” saying there should be more support for such a facility, in light of the campus funding a $150 million engineering building.</p>\n<p>Associated Student Food Bank advisors Tuyen Nguyen and Erick Lankey reported to the Senate on the expanding operations of the organization. Nguyen said the food bank is going to move beyond non-perishable goods to include more fresh produce.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to make sure students have access to healthier foods, which is what we’re working on.” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Some of the bills that passed included one to provide $3,000 in funding for the UCSB men’s club soccer team to travel to the National Tournament in Phoenix, Arizona, in addition to a motion to provide $3,000 in funding for the Pi Beta Phi Foundation lip-sync contest that will be held in Campbell Hall, raising money to provide books to underprivileged children.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she supported the event on the grounds of the number of students expected to attend.</p>\n<p>“There’s more than 850 students that attend this event and that’s a pretty significant portion of the student body,” MacLachlan said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed a resolution to organize fundraising for an endowment that would grant a scholarship to undocumented students, introduced by Senator Marvin Ramirez. Senators also established a group project to create a landlord rating website to protect students from unfair property owners and managers. The project intends to work with multiple on campus organizations and groups.</p>\n<p>Finally, plans were discussed to establish an A.S. YouTube channel that would allow for live streaming of student senate meetings to make the proceedings more accessible to the general student body. The live streaming meetings are part of an effort to increase A.S. Senate transparency and they come in light of one student addressing the governmental body’s alleged failure to connect with students. Jimmy Villarreal said that he appreciated the criticism, saying “I want to thank you for coming in and holding us accountable.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516561681\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52880\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52882\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/as-senate_11-06-2013_kenneth-song-8940/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1383773729\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-52882\" alt=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/","id":3064,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3063,3062,3061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Soriano said he plans to mount a giant projector screen right over San Miguel stage, which would cost around $7,000. According to Soriano, the project is relatively inexpensive and will pay for itself in less than three uses.</p>\n<p>Even though a mural is slated to be painted on the wall where the projector screen will be mounted, Soriano explained the screen would not get in the way of students’ ability to enjoy the mural as it could be easily rolled up and stored. Soriano said the screen would be available for use for any student in the residence halls who can provide their own projector and extension cable.</p>\n<p>“All the buildings have their own projector set and an extension cord,” Soriano said. “Bringing the projector just beyond the stage is good enough to have a reasonably sized image.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli discussed the current status of the A.S. annex in I.V. and upcoming plans for its use. The ad hoc committee dedicated to the annex, of which Khazaieli is chair, has been overseeing the development of the space for the past three years. Although the funding for the annex comes from funds that are paid by all students, the annex will only be available to A.S. groups that make appointments beforehand.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders — such as A.S. committees — and student fees currently cover the cost of leasing space.</p>\n<p>“It’s easier to arrange through an A.S. group, but all students are allowed and encouraged to use the space as well,” Khazaieli said. “Student fees are already being used to pay the lease. Every student is technically a stakeholder in the space and we are really trying to respect that.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. groups will hold a survey over the next two weeks to get a better idea of what the community wants from the space.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, member of A.S. Community Financial Fund Jose Raygoza spoke about different grants and supplemental loans available to students. Last year, according to Raygoza, $82,330 was given out and divided into 227 grants. Raygoza said he has noticed a trend that indicates that grants are more in demand, meaning that it will become more difficult for students to receive any.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has an equal chance to apply, but applicants are chosen on a first-come, first-serve basis,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>Raygoza said CFF is looking into ways of finding more money for grants. Senators also discussed adding additional tables to the dining commons, the ongoing process of adding a Gender and Sexuality General Education requirement and logistics surrounding the hydration stations that will be set up during Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/","id":3063,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3062,3061,3060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Senate Discusses Halloween, New UC President","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting addressed a wide range of A.S. projects, including the logistics of Halloween preparation and new developments with U.C.

President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke about safety preparations for Isla Vista’s notoriously massive Halloween festivities. Moore reported the idea of temporary fencing he hoped to install along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive to prevent cliff fall injuries or deaths was shut down due to funding issues as well as liability concerns, from the University’s Office of Risk Management.</p>\n<p>Moore said he was frustrated with the decision but is determined to continue working on the issue, as he remains confident in achieving future success.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be moving forward to negotiate with the county on some sort of framework or method, so that this doesn’t happen again [and] so that we can always have temporary fencing during high-risk events,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned the Festival ordinance that will be in effect from this Saturday until Nov. 4, saying he and other groups are working to make students aware of the ordinance and other changes. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure folks don’t get an unnecessary ticket,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said hydration stations and portable bathrooms will be set up for each night of Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, executive officers and public forum speakers delivered reports on their recent accomplishments and upcoming activities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud discussed his recent meeting with new U.C. President Napolitano in Oakland on Monday during his report, in which he expressed positive results that included promises from her to meet with the elected members of campus governments in person once a quarter and to speak to them on the phone once per month.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abboud said he was pleased with their success in getting Napolitano to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>“She did well, in terms of answering what we wanted but we did corner her on a couple of things we wanted … like Prop 13,” Abboud said. “So we got her to admit that Prop 13 is one of the reasons tuition has gotten so high.”</p>\n<p>Along with the passing of a few minor bills, the meeting tabled a bill sending directives to Napolitano. Towards the end of the meeting, Senators debated the bill, concluding they would clarify the language and demands of the drafted proposal and vote on it next week.</p>\n<p>One section of the bill prohibits the use of U.C. funds to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Senator Nikki Calderon, currently no U.C. funds go toward assisting ICE, but the bill ensures that these funds will not be used in the future. This section Calderon said, serves to secure that the funding “may not be happening, but it will not happen also.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a tree-planting event Saturday at Goleta Valley Beautiful, planned homeless assistance in I.V. provided by Pescadero Lofts and efforts to make the dining commons Kosher-friendly. For next week’s meeting, Senate members will come dressed in their Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This story is a </em>Daily Nexus<em> online exclusive.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/","id":3062,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3061,3060,3059],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The resolution was first introduced during last week’s meeting and then tabled until yesterday.</p>\n<p>The resolutions’ demands for Napolitano included holding mandatory trainings for UCPD on the rights of undocumented students’ and other underrepresented groups, having UC staff training on the issues that undocumented students experience and supporting the Trust Act, which Governor Jerry Brown recently signed into law.</p>\n<p>Several audience members who spoke at Public Forum had also attended last week’s meeting and reiterated their reasons for supporting the resolution. Anisha Ahuja and Katlen Abu Ata issued a prepared statement on behalf of A.S. Human Rights Board, emphasizing the confusing process by which Napolitano was elected and the threat they believe she poses to members of the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“We, the UC Santa Barbara Human Rights Board, stand in solidarity with communities that have been attacked and further marginalized under the leadership of Napolitano during her term as Secretary of Homeland Security,” Ahuja and Abu Ata stated. “We aim to create a safe space and advocate for all students, regardless of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientation and classes. We work to pressure the University to uphold these standards and qualities of fair and equal treatment.”</p>\n<p>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS said passing the resolution would show solidarity with other UC campuses that have already passed similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“Passing a vote of ‘no confidence’ — it has so much weight in terms of being in solidarity with other Campuses and being able to say UC Santa Barbara will have no confidence with you because of your history,” Campos said. “These concerns are valid. I don’t know how else to convince you all.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Norma Orozco said the resolution presented a critical opportunity for the senate to take a definitive stand on a pressing issue.<br>\n“At UCSB I’ve seen a lot of student politicians, and A.S. is supposed to be a place for everyone. It’s supposed to be a place that creates student leaders. I really want you all to take this idea really to mind, to heart…as a leader,” Orozco said.</p>\n<p>Following public forum and administrative tasks, senators debated the resolution themselves. Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield said that public forum showed how little opposition there was to the resolution, and that he could not see clear negative consequences to it.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have students saying that they oppose this resolution coming to the senate,” Wakefield said. “Voting yes on this would not be negative. No students are going to be suffering if we say yes.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Off-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal said he did not feel the demands outlined in the resolution directly applied to Napolitano’s role as UC President.</p>\n<p>“The most important part should be the demands that were made,” Villarreal said. “I don’t feel that the demands actually fall under Napolitano’s job description.”</p>\n<p>Senator Amir Khazaieli said he doubted the bill would yield tangible results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like this bill for one main reason, not because of the ‘no confidence’ clause but mainly because it fails to introduce tangible results that will change our campus for the better,” Khazaieli said. “Let’s make some directives and let’s add it to the resolution.”</p>\n<p>Other senators took issue with the “aggressive” language of the bill, such as Off-Campus Senator Jake Orens, who felt that Napolitano should be given a chance to act as president before being attacked.</p>\n<p>“I think she has a chance and I think the bill can be revised…but I just don’t feel comfortable with how aggressive it is,” Orens said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said the aggressive tone is actually a point in favor of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think being aggressive is necessarily a bad thing,” Theus said. “I have seen so many things come out of the senate office…because of decisions that were aggressive but that needed to happen…A lot of things aren’t ever going to change in the world if you’re not being aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice Contreras, who authored the resolution, urged the senators to move to a vote and let their vote speak for them. After the vote, Contreras said the decision could set a dangerous precedent for the Senate.</p>\n<p>“I feel like from now on, [members of the communities affected by the resolution] are going to be very hesitant about approaching us, they’re going to be very hesitant about asking us anything, hesitant about us representing them,” Contreras said. “We have to earn their trust and their respect back.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/","id":3060,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3059,3058,3057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Now her track record is making many students question her ability to prioritize the needs of undocumented UC students, and various students groups — such as Human Rights Board, the Black Student Union and UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (a coalition of undocumented students) — all formally denounced her appointment at yesterday’s Senate meeting.</div>\n<div>Napolitano was appointed by the UC Regents to replace Mark Yudof as UC President in July, with all but Student Regent Cinthia Flores voting in favor of her appointment.</div>\n<div>At Public Forum, students and other community members voiced support for a unified resolution called “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students and Immigrant Communities,” which presents several demands to recently appointed Napolitano. The Resolution concludes by stating that, if passed, the Senate expresses “no confidence” in Napolitano’s ability to perform as UC President. However, as of press time, Senate decided to not vote on the issue and wait until next week to reach a final decision.</div>\n<div>Katlen Abuata of Human Rights Board was the first to approach the A.S. Senate with her support of the resolution, and Abuata said Napolitano’s appointment jeopardizes the safety of certain minority communities on campus.</div>\n<div>“You all are here and you have the extreme privilege of representing a diverse group of students; some of these students are undocumented,” Abuata said. “Some of these students have a fear of having a leader of their UC system being someone that deported hundreds of thousands of people.”</div>\n<div>Second-year Mohsin Mirza, who also came on behalf of HRB, said the process by which Napolitano was selected does not reflect the interests of the general UC student population.</div>\n<div>“I think we need to highlight the fact that her appointment in the first place was completely undemocratic,” Mirza said. “None of [the potential candidates] have any experience with education … As student leaders here, you’re asked to represent the students … I don’t see a group here saying ‘We love Napolitano. We want her to be here.’”</div>\n<div>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS provided a personal testimony of her experience as an undocumented student, explaining why she felt Napolitano was a detrimental influence to the UC system.</div>\n<div>“I am an undocumented student. I was at that meeting yesterday with Napolitano,” Campos said.  “I can’t say how I felt … to have someone that has caused so much damage to our community — not only students who are undocumented, but students who aren’t undocumented who have parents [who] are undocumented … I don’t know if you can understand what that feels like to have her as our new UC president.”</div>\n<div>Liam Stanton, another student at Public Forum, provided another perspective on the resolution. While Stanton said he disagreed with Napolitano’s appointment, he urged Senators to move forward through open negotiations, rather than a vote of no confidence.</div>\n<div>“The reality of it is that now she is the president of the UC system,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe that an utter show of no confidence gets us anywhere.”</div>\n<div>Fourth-year Norma Orozco also came to Public Forum to stress the negative impact of Napolitano’s appointment on undocumented students at UCSB, saying that UCSB should value their undocumented community.</div>\n<div>“This year, in fact, we have the largest amount of undocumented population at UCSB, and it’s something to be proud of,” Orozco said. “It is our duty, our responsibility, and it is our right to tell her that we have no confidence in her.”</div>\n<div>Chancellor Henry T. Yang also spoke at the meeting, assuring the student body that he would be available for any necessary support. Additionally, Off-Campus Senator Jake Speyer announced he would be transferring schools after Fall Quarter, and therefore resigning from his senatorial position, which means the candidate who received the next most votes during last spring’s elections will be offered the position.</div>\n<div>The executive officers presented their first reports for the coming school year, announcing what projects would be released from their respective offices. These include renovations to the UCen, a student-led classes initiative, a waitlist system to be implemented on UCSB GOLD and a visit by President Napolitano to the campus in November, at which students will be able to directly address her with concerns.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>This article appeared on page 4 of Thursday October 3, 2013′s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[CORRECTION: The print version of this article was incorrectly titled, “A.S.

Speakers also called to question the clarity of the appointment process, particularly with regards to Committee on Committees and Elections Committee.</p>\n<p>University Owned Housing Senator for the 2012–2013 school year Miya Sommers addressed the Senate with concerns about the appointment process. Sommers took issue with the disqualification of Nicholas Dineen for Elections Committee on the grounds of party affiliation, as Dineen had been disqualified after he “liked” a Democratic Process Party Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that going through someone’s Facebook and seeing something that they like on Facebook is grounds for neutrality,” Sommers said.</p>\n<p>Sommers also said the disqualification process was problematic as there had been inconsistencies for different positions. While Dineen had been originally recommended for the position through the interview process, he had later been disqualified, Sommers said.</p>\n<p>According to Sommers, the appointee for Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo should have been disqualified on the same grounds, as the attorney general position is also supposed to be a neutral position and Maghsoodloo was a chair of the Open People’s Party during A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“If he’s not being appointed, I have a problem with Sawyeh then being appointed,” Sommers said. “She has a clear party affiliation, and she’s not being docked on that.”</p>\n<p>After Sommers spoke, Maghsoodloo addressed the Senate to respond to some of Sommers’ claims. Maghsoodloo said she agreed the interview process needed improvement, but also said her own appointment had been legitimate.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Chair of Committee on Committees Asami Osato also came to public forum in order to answer senators’ questions regarding the application process. As chair, Osato was responsible for making the official appointment recommendations to the president.</p>\n<p>Osato said she felt the application process had been fair, with the interview process lasting approximately 15 hours every week for three weeks. She also said she felt party affiliation was not difficult to discern with candidates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s pretty obvious whether or not you’re party affiliated,” Osato said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also decided to approve the appointments and during the meeting, the new executive officers delivered reports on their first weeks in office. Officers announced their decisions regarding their appointments for staff, while also discussing the progress of their respective offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore said he met with leaders of the queer community, who had expressed a desire to reach out to members of Greek life on campus.</p>\n<p>“They want to do some Greek outreach because they feel like there’s some problems coming from the fraternities especially,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate said she is focusing on the question of online education in the UC system, for which there are currently two bills in front of the California Senate.</p>\n<p>“The bills are SB 520, which we really don’t like because it basically is going to allow for the privatization of our education, allowing for private entities to come in and profit,” Choate said. “Another one is SB 547, but it doesn’t have nearly as much support in the Senate, as of right now.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the addition of a new position on his staff — the deputy chief of staff — while Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s report focused on transitions to the new Senate, discussing projects that must be handed down to new senators, including a Sobering Center in Isla Vista and an LGBTQ General Education requirement.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said he is working on a convention with the SAGs from colleges throughout Southern California, and that he has already begun working on his advocacy agenda.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/","id":3058,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3057,3056,3055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bike Safety Week Holds Workshop, Surveys on Campus Bicycle Paths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The A.S.

Bike Committee is hosting Bike Safety Week from now until Friday, encouraging students to practice caution while riding through the sometimes-risky bike paths on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee will be tabling at the Arbor all week as well as passing out bike lights and surveys for students to improve their knowledge of bike safety. On Friday, the committee will hold a bike fix-it workshop with a mechanic from the A.S. Bike Shop, allowing local cyclists to learn repair skills and other useful biking knowledge.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee works all year to improve the biking climate of UCSB, with current plans to launch renovations to the bike racks at the Music Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and the University Center, in addition to a long-term plan to implement a new roundabout path near the tunnel located by the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, maintaining the quality of the bike culture at UCSB — which is ranked second only to Stanford as the most ‘bike-friendly’ university nationwide — is a top priority for students.</p>\n<p>“Bike culture is, in my opinion, one of the integral parts of the UCSB student experience,” Kennedy said. “Currently, UCSB is ranked as the second-most bike-friendly university … and we think we can be the best.”</p>\n<p>Bike Committee Chair Emily Littleworth said although she does not believe the biking climate at UCSB is particularly dangerous, it can be daunting for incoming students.</p>\n<p>“If you haven’t biked at UCSB, and you come here for the first time, and you see all the students, it can be overwhelming,” Littleworth said. “I think it takes some practice learning how to ride on the bike paths, learning regular traffic laws that people should abide to.”</p>\n<p>Littleworth said Bike Committee aims to reduce the danger by both improving cycling infrastructure and educating the community on safe biking tips.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bike Committee is basically devoted to improving the bicycle system on campus at UCSB,” Littleworth said. “We do things ranging from basic improvements on bike paths, to putting in new racks, to putting in bike pumps around campus.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he hopes to reach out to a larger number of students in the future, as a means of expanding and strengthening the committee.</p>\n<p>“One thing I’m working on for next year is trying to get more general members involved,” Kennedy said. “Because I think we need to democratize the whole process and expand the committee.”</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/","id":3117,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3116,3115,3114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Womyn’s Commission’s annual runway show will take place at the Corwin Pavilion this evening, as part of the group’s ongoing efforts to challenge societal beauty norms and represent the vast diversity of the campus.</p>\n<p>The ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show, which will be held at 5:30 p.m., will include live student-run performances of spoken word, in addition to a runway show and other acts open to student participation. The runway aspect of the event aims to shine light on body image topics that individuals in contemporary society oftentimes struggle with. Students can volunteer to participate in the runway to share their input on body image issues or to provide their own personal testimony. A.S. Womyn’s Commission hosts several events each year, all of which deal with various issues affecting women both on campus and in local communities.</p>\n<p>Kristina Didero, Womyn’s Commisson member and third-year sociology major, said the event will replicate mainstream runway shows but will include other aspects intended to make participants feel more comfortable.</p>\n<p>“It will be made to be as much like a real fashion show — where the model will have their picture taken at the end of the catwalk,” Didero said in an email. “Models are allowed to walk with other people as well, so those who don’t want to walk alone can still feel more comfortable participating in that portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>Popular modern media frequently emphasizes body image standards to an extent that has caused many to become “nit-picky” and “obsessive” with their own bodies, according to Didero, who said these individuals sometimes said never reach total satisfaction with their appearances. Didero said such an unhealthy dynamic should change, as it sets norms that make individuals practice excessive self-criticism.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the phrase ‘great body’ is never associated with anything other than the ideal 36-24-36 type for females,” Didero said in an email. “I personally feel like I don’t go a day without hearing multiple comments from various people criticizing their image and essentially indulging in negative self-talk. The conversation needs to change in terms of this topic, and the focus on appearance should be diminished.”</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan said the ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show will highlight the problems with standardized beauty, while drawing focus to the many different ways one can be beautiful. Agazaryan said discussion of this topic is especially crucial since the vast number of unhealthy living conditions, such as eating disorders, occur as a result of unfair beauty standards.</p>\n<p>“There is no one ideal type of beauty and what the media constantly displays isn’t the only kind of beauty,” Agazaryan said in an email. “We put on this event every year to raise awareness about beauty stigmas and eating disorders that arise as a result of this. Everyone is beautiful. We want to use the show to allow everyone the opportunity to be models to demonstrate what they believe is beauty.”</p>\n<p>Agazaryan said she believes that society’s definition of beauty is flawed as a result of fashion magazines and advertisements that promote unrealistic, and sometimes unhealthy, ideals of beauty.</p>\n<p>“Those ‘beautiful’ people we see are artificially created through Photoshop and digital media,” Agazaryan said in a email. “They don’t exist. I think that beauty is skin deep. I have met so many beautiful people that don’t necessary fit into the ‘standard’ of ‘beauty’ whom I believe are a hundred times more beautiful than what I see in magazines.”</p>\n<p>However, the examples set by these media outlets and advertisements can lead one to practice a sense of self-doubt and self-criticism that is difficult to escape, according to Agazaryan.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to ignore the issue of body image since it’s so internalized,” Agazaryan said. “Everyone at one point or another in their lives has questioned their body image. I, personally, still have issues with my body and it’s been so internalized that it’s difficult to shut it off sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Students can participate in the runway or sit in the audience members, and those interested in modeling can email Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Historian Olivia Jaffe-Pachuilo, second-year french major, said the campus organization is aiming to encourage self-confidence and appreciation for one’s body.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote body positivity and self-love,” Jaffe-Pachuilo said in an email. “Everyone deserves the right to feel beautiful in their own skin and their own bodies. Ideally, I hope that people would go away feeling empowered and more at peace with their bodies.”</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/","id":3119,"author":{"id":197,"name":"Shannon Ham"},"related":[3118,3117,3116],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Out With the Old, In With the New: 2013-14 A.S.

Their meeting lasted approximately two-and-a-half hours, with the longest discussion surrounding a debate over whether to approve the appointment of Aidan Brorsen to the position of chair of A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>Before officially swearing in the new senators, however, outgoing senators offered reflections on their terms and gave advice to the incoming team.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson said she urges new senators to strive for a productive term in office.</p>\n<p>“Don’t let yourself get to where we are right now. Don’t let yourself get to a year from now, and not feel like you’ve done anything on Senate,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders stressed the importance of building relationships with fellow student policymakers outside of the Senate meetings, so as to maintain a healthy work environment. Sanders said fostering such bonds and friendships within A.S. can potentially help members during conflicts or issues.</p>\n<p>“Have parties together. Socialize together. Hang out together outside of Senate,” Sanders said. “Make some personal connections so that you aren’t yelling at someone in Senate that you hate because you don’t even know them.”</p>\n<p>According to Off-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur, the incoming Senate should strive to go beyond requirements detailed by the legal code and reach out to groups or communities who may not already have a presence on the Senate.</p>\n<p>“In your legal code, actually, it does state that you must go to organizations that you do not identify with — at least one meeting or event,” Kaur said. “I really, really, really do encourage that you do that extensively and beyond what your legal code dictates, making sure that you reach out to communities that you do not identify with, and that you are educating yourself and learning in this process as well.”</p>\n<p>Regarding the debate surrounding Brorsen’s appointment as chair of Committee on Committees, outgoing University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she felt the appointment process lacked clarity.</p>\n<p>Sommers said she was unsure of why the opposing candidate Zach Goulhiane was not chosen during public forum and she questioned the basis behind Brorsen’s appointment.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe that he was accepted for his interview. I believe that he was accepted for external reasons,” Sommers said. “I think the external appointments need to be more closely looked at.”</p>\n<p>Newly sworn-in A.S. President Jonathan Abboud said Brorsen’s appointment over Goulhiane’s was due to the other candidate’s potential for placement in other A.S. positions.</p>\n<p>“Zach is being highly considered, basically selected, for other positions within the association,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>After much deliberation, the decision to confirm the appointment was tabled for one week, providing senators with more time to obtain information regarding each of the candidates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"580960544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51570\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-2013-14-a-s-executive-officers-assume-roles/senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369269354\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51571\" alt=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Marisela Marquez addresses A.S.

Senate members and executive officers for next year. Both the new Senate and new executive board consist largely of Open People’s Party candidates, as all executives for the 2013-2014 school year are former O.P.P. candidates. Jonathan Abboud was sworn into the position of President, while Kyley Scarlet was sworn in as Internal Vice President and Alex Moore was sworn in as External Vice President of Local Affairs. Alex Choate officially took the seat of External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Kristian Whittaker was sworn in as Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>In regards to executive reports, Haile spoke first and named specific entities and individual whom he said he was targeted and attacked by — including Rabbi Evan Goodman, President-elect Jonathan Abboud, Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni and the <i>Daily Nexus,</i> amongst others.</p>\n<p>According to Haile, many of the allegations levied against him were a result of racial prejudice, particularly ones surrounding divestment meetings, in which he and other executives voiced their opinions. The Student Advocate General said he was accused by Rabbi Goodman of anti-Semitism, who Haile said ignored the similar opinions voiced by other speakers.</p>\n<p>“Given that the content of my speech was quite similar to at least 100 people who spoke during public forum, it’s interesting that the Rabbi chose to come after me and nobody else, at least to the extent that he did,” Haile said. “I believe race was a big factor in his treatment of me … I am an African man, a black man. I say that because the Rabbi knows nothing about me, aside from what I look like and what I said during public forum and my Exec report.”</p>\n<p>Haile also mentioned a <i>Daily Nexus</i> endorsement article for this year’s A.S. elections, which was published on April 22 and “called to question his ability to act as the nonpartisan resource that the OSA is expected to be.”</p>\n<p>“Given your history of publishing anti-Black Op-eds and other commentaries, I am not surprised,” Haile said. “I did not know racism and white supremacy were partisan issues for me to stay out of.”</p>\n<p>Later in the report, Haile highlighted “remarkable feats” met by the SAG Office during his term, describing his office as a “strong and beautiful team” that has counseled and assisted students through academic troubles, legal issues and housing issues, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“We helped and counseled hundreds of students regarding many issues they were struggling with ranging from being kicked out of school, cancellation of housing contracts, family problems, targeted treatment by police and much more,” Haile said.</p>\n<p>He also applauded the office’s participation in on-campus organizational efforts and its collaboration with the Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Following Haile’s report was EVPSA Houssain’s speech, which was supportive of Haile’s statements and also said this school year included a number of positive efforts and changes.</p>\n<p>In his address, Houssain mentioned the success of passing Proposition 30, the record number of students registered to vote and a campaign addressing the corruption surrounding the prison industrial complex in California as some of the most successful accomplishments of his term.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Siordia spoke after Houssain and said there were over 30 initiatives launched through the EVPLA office this year. Siordia said his experience was rewarding, as it also helped him shape his sense of self.</p>\n<p>“How can I take one of the most cherished experiences of my life and describe it with words?” Siordia asked. “I truly feel like I’m losing the central and primary part of my identity. But even though this part of my life will no longer exist, I will still carry all of the incredible lessons that I’ve learned with me.”</p>\n<p>IVP Segovia spoke next, as she said her time in office allowed her to realize that she could not let others define her own personal identity.</p>\n<p>“You are your own worst enemy — the only person who knows you better than any one else ever will,” Segovia said. “You have the freedom to find yourself, think for yourself, and stay true to who you think you are.”</p>\n<p>Finally, President Armen delivered her executive report, also noting her negative experiences in A.S. She said she was unfairly attacked throughout her time at UCSB, and she urged listeners to treat each other with respect.</p>\n<p>“One of the most radical things that people can do is actually to have love in everything that they do,” Armen said. “I have, in the face of all of this, still shown love and respect and waved and smiled at every person that I met here, you know, and it’s been difficult. But, I have to say it’s all been working.”</p>\n<p>Armen said she did not believe political parties dominated A.S. but rather, that unhealthy power dynamics have weakened the organization.</p>\n<p>“While the party politics seem like the overrun A.S. — no,” Armen said. “We have power issues in this place that need to be addressed. We have one party that has won for six years 90 percent of the seats…If you want to look at things nationally, and you were to compare the systems, you would say there’s a problem, too.”</p>\n<p>Armen concluded her report with a spoken word piece that she wrote during her campaign for election last year. The piece focused on justice and humanity.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want no movement, if there ain’t no humanity,” Armen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1608402219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51558\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

External Vice President of Local Affairs, Alex Moore said he will improve safety conditions in Isla Vista through a new Bluelight smart phone application that allows students to make faster emergency calls. Moore also said he will advocate “Keep It Local” campaigns for Halloween and Deltopia, and added that he will institute student lobbying efforts at the local, countywide level.</p>\n<p>“I talked about maybe having student lobby type conference things, where students actually speak to the Board of Supervisors and students express their concerns directly to them,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>These efforts could tackle Isla Vista’s most controversial issues and laws, such as the Social Host Ordinance. The Bluelight application being spearheaded by Moore allows users to push a button to send an emergency warning, and it automatically sends user location and personal information to a friend or to 911. The device has already proven successful, reducing police response time by as much as 44 percent at other campuses, Moore said.</p>\n<p><strong><img data-attachment-id=\"51500\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/a-s-to-swear-in-next-years-executive-officers/alexandria-choate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alexandria Choate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51500 alignleft\" alt=\"Alexandria Choate\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">External Vice President of Statewide Affairs – EVPSA </strong></p>\n<p>Alex Choate said she plans to reach out to a greater, more diverse portion of students as External Vice President of Statewide Affairs.

Whittaker said Haile’s objectivity has been called into question by his decision to hold a stance on the issue of divestment.</p>\n<p>“Just the mere fact he was there in solidarity with one side or the other, definitely doesn’t seem the right message for the office,” Whittaker said. Whittaker said he hopes to make the Office of the Student Advocate General more objective and neutral, and on the issue of diversity, he said the current office achieves “physical” diversity but lacks more “mental” diversity.

Senators proved responsive to students who lobbied at the meeting, adhering more closely to requests from student groups who spoke in public forum such as Queer Commission and Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>For most allocations, Senators allocated an amount of the funds between the proposed budgets of A.S. Finance Board and the A.S. President. However, the organizations S.C.O.R.E., S.I.R.R.C., Student Lobby and Human Rights Board were given more money than either Finance Board or the President suggested.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed revisions to the A.S. Election Code, as well as the legality of Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia’s interpretation of the legal code at last week’s meeting regarding divestment from companies that profit from the military occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan addressed public forum in defense of the organization’s requested allocations. Agazaryan said she was disheartened by the substantial cuts made to all of the Boards, Committees, and Commissions as opposed to other entities in light of the budget restrictions.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit ridiculous that BCCs are bearing the brunt of it,” Agazaryan said. “Senate, you hold a lot of power, but again, the BCCs is where it’s at.”</p>\n<p>Queer commission member James Neally said the need for increased LGBTQ education within the UCSB community is critical, especially in regards to the current campus climate.</p>\n<p>“Everything that Queer Commission does is very important to all the students here,” Neally said. “Even today there’s problems with people on our campus and a lot of education that needs to be done still.”</p>\n<p>Representatives from both Queer Commission and Womyn’s commission pointed towards the annual publication of Herstory! — a magazine that aims to give a voice to underrepresented minorities — as an important budget item.</p>\n<p>Representatives from various other organizations also presented in defense of their budget requests during public forum including the Student Commission on Racial Equality, Rally Commission, the Offices of the Student Advocate General and the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Take Back the Night.</p>\n<p>Senators spent several hours discussing each item on the budget individually, and eventually reached a consensus, which was approved at 6:02 a.m.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also touched on the AFSCME protest of the Regents Meeting, the Elections code, and whether or not Segovia had acted in accordance with the legal code when she decided that 12 votes did not constitute enough of a majority for last week’s divestment resolution to pass. Segovia asserted that although she may have been mistaken in her logic, she had been correct in her interpretation.</p>\n<p>A motion was made to officially reconsider the chair’s decision, but the action was voted down.</p>\n<h6><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"166327550\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51439\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/panel-debates-ethics-of-drone-warfare-at-campbell-hall/web_senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51436\" alt=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></h6>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s Associated Students meeting, senators took 12 hours to vote on the A.S. budget for the 2013-2014 school year.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/","id":3079,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3078,3077,3076],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legal Code. Under Legal code, a simple majority is 50 percent of Senators plus one, not counting abstentions — meaning that passage of the resolution would have required a “yes” vote from 13 of the 23 senators present (rounded up from 12.5).</p>\n<p>Authors of the resolution said they sought to incorporate critiques of the original document — “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” — in their revisions and hoped that Senators would note the changes. University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she believed the revisions made the resolution more neutral and less divisively worded.</p>\n<p>“This resolution — there’s a lot of changes into it. We definitely took all of the criticisms,” Sommers said. “This resolution is not taking sides; it’s not saying that we have an idea of what we want to happen around the issue. We, instead, are just asking for our school to not be involved.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor and third-year political science major Katlen Abuata said the resolution did not intend to attack Israel itself but instead aimed to pressure the state to end certain policies.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing here is not questioning the existence of Israel because we don’t want to do that at all. We don’t delegitimize the state of Israel,” Abuata said. “We are asking you to recognize that there are human rights violations and that there are students on this campus who feel uncomfortable with that.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speaker Liran Braude said he did not believe the underlying intent of the resolution changed with the revisions.</p>\n<p>“This has become more than a little bit ridiculous,” Braude said. “The entire student body’s resources, time and money are being spent so that one group can attempt to force their own personal political complaint on the Senate, at the expense of another group on campus. The bottom line of this resolution has not changed at all.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Ben Green said he rejected the idea of the resolution’s “neutrality.”</p>\n<p>“It keeps being said that this isn’t taking a stance, and that this won’t be alienating people,” Green said. “It creates a controversial issue and a climate where people don’t feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Senators also touched on a number of arguments discussed in previous meetings such as impact of the decision on the campus climate, which communities would feel marginalized and what financial impact the resolution would have on UCSB. Following a heated debate over what constitutes a majority vote, Segovia announced her decision in tears, apologizing to anyone who would feel hurt by the defeat.</p>\n<p>In response, A.S. President Sophia Armen encouraged students to maintain civility when deliberating on sensitive issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re all still people, we’re all still students and it’s disheartening to see how much anger, how much pain, can be inflicted on each other,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also began a discussion on the budget for the 2013-2014 school year, which was tabled last week due to a controversial vote on the divestment issue and was supposed to be finalized by the end of Wednesday’s meeting. Members of the Queer Commission, Human Rights Board, A.S. Food Bank and other groups presented defenses for funding requests, but the Senate ultimately decided to extend the budget deadline for one more week in order to more thoroughly examine each Board, Committee and Commission request.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1649098816\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51321\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51323\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/as_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51323\" alt=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.
