In Santa Barbara County, there are </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-27/coronavirus-in-santa-barbara-county-case-counts-and-locations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, 38 UCSB students have been tested for the coronavirus, with no positive results as of yet, Javanbakht said. As of March 25, 18 tests have come back negative and 20 tests are pending results, which can take up to a week to get back. All 38 tests were conducted through </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-labcorp-quest-diagnostics-are-growing-testing-capacity.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quest Diagnostics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a private testing laboratory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-08/ucsb-student-health-executive-director-explains-coronavirus-protocol-and-ongoing-measures/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">months</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Student Health has adhered to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the coronavirus and worked with numerous campus entities to devise transmission prevention measures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But recently, Javanbakht said Student Health has also begun designating a prescription pickup area, conducting virtual appointments and cordoning off a section of Student Health so “students who have any kind of respiratory symptom are in a separate part of the building” and to minimize contact between students and workers at Student Health, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any student who visits Student Health during this time will have their temperature taken and will be asked if they are experiencing any symptoms associated with the coronavirus, such as fever, shortness of breath or cough, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our main goal is to do what we can to help our students so that if they end up needing to go to an outside urgent care or emergency room — if COVID spreads as we expect it to — urgent cares and emergency rooms can be really overrun and their demands can be really high,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said that although the off-campus area is out of Student Health’s purview, the university “acknowledges that they are closely tied” with Isla Vista, where thousands of UCSB students packed their bags to ride out the pandemic at home. As a result, the university is closely monitoring how safe it is for students to not only return to campus, but also to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from Isla Vista if they can; in an email sent out to the student body on March 23, the university urged students to stay at home if they traveled for spring break, noting that Isla Vista has a population of more than 20,000 in less than two square miles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said it is “highly unlikely” that things will return to normal by the end of spring quarter, but “depending on how well we implement our interventions now, as far as social distancing, that could put us in a good position [to return in the] summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the situation doesn’t improve by summer, he said, “we could be looking at fall” for in-person classes to resume.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amidst cancellations and closures, from UCSB’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-26/breaking-ucsb-postpones-commencement-will-host-virtual-ceremony-in-june/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postponed commencement ceremony</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announced Thursday to the order for all </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-25/as-santa-barbara-county-tightens-grip-on-coronavirus-prevention-i-v-businesses-hollow-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-essential businesses to close</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many young adults </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/deniers-and-disbelievers-if-i-get-corona-i-get-corona.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have ignored calls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for social distancing in favor of going out and spending time with friends. But students can risk infecting themselves and others when they do so, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the virus transmits through “secretions” that come from coughing, talking or exhaling, the closer people are to one another, the higher the risk their interactions carry, he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about interacting in a way that would be less risky, interacting outside is always better than any kind of indoor space,” he said. “And keeping six feet regardless of where you are, even outdoors, is much better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In transmitting the virus, Javanbakht said each person acts like an “ember.” People who have the virus can spread it to those who do not — by seeing friends, going out and entering other people’s personal spaces — and create a wildfire of contagion, but by staying at home, “the fire’s not going to spread anywhere because it’s contained within [a] house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication among housemates also matters, Javanbahkt said. For people who plan to stay in I.V. and are living with multiple housemates, he stressed the importance of keeping outside interactions to a minimum — all it takes is one housemate to spread the virus to everyone in the house.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody has three roommates and they’ve lived together all year and they plan to stay together for the rest of spring quarter, that’s great,” he said. “As long as they keep it to those three people and they don’t have people coming over or going over to someone else’s house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all in-person classes have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Javanbakht said campus entities from all corners of the university frequently meet to discuss protocols, contingency plans and emergency operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entities include the UCSB COVID-19 Task Force, made up of the chancellor, vice chancellor, faculty and financial department members, as well as the COVID-19 operations team, which includes the vice chancellor and representatives from Student Health and Housing and Dining Services, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was during these twice-a-day meetings, which he said have been taking place for several weeks, that campus entities such as the University Library and Recreation Center made the decision to close indefinitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said the university plans to update the student body about which services they can access during a digital spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the updates will detail “what’s going to be done remotely, what kinds of services are available in person, what’s operating and what’s not operating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are plenty of [messages] that will be coming out as the situation evolves,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

But the often unpredictable nature of college acceptances meant that UCSB, UC San Diego and Boston University are her current top three choices — despite not having visited any of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a shutdown of non-essential campus functions, UCSB’s April 18 annual open house — an opportunity for prospective students to tour the campus, interact with different student organizations and hear from administrative and student speakers — has been canceled indefinitely. The university’s visitor center has been shut down until May 4 out of an “abundance of caution regarding the outbreak of COVID-19,” </span><a href=\"http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/visit-ucsb/open-house\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to UCSB’s admissions website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, UCSB admissions still advises would-be students to “experience UCSB through a virtual tour” and learn more about the school through </span><a href=\"http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/connect/webinars\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">webinar events</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business at U</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSB</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clubs and Organizations</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sports and Recreation and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greek Life at UCSB</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will be posted online throughout April, according to Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Przekop added that prospective students can also visit the webinar page during regular business hours to live-chat with admissions counselors and enrolled students and to sign up for informational texting and calling campaigns to remind students of important dates.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Przekop empathized with students who are unable to tour colleges and explained that the admissions team is working to provide adequate solutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are working under tremendous pressure to complete the transfer admission process by the April 22 deadline and to make the transition to serve students the best we can while working remotely,” she said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They should focus on staying healthy and use this time at home to visit college websites, participate in virtual tours and virtual fairs, visit the college’s social media sites, and use email.  Most of us are doing virtual advising, phone calls, emailing responses to questions. We are here working full time on their behalf.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Przekop asked students to reach out to UCSB online student resources, counselors and attending students before the May 1 college decision deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The right fit is still the single most important factor in selecting a college, so do your research.  Use social media wisely,” she said. “Talk with current students, follow instagram and twitter feeds but at the same time understand that some posts represent the “extremes” so don’t make decisions based on a single post that you read.  Be a smart consumer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But webinars and online events “don’t really give me the same experience as visiting the campus in person,” Campbell noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even for students that have already toured prospective schools, such as California High School senior Amy Hoefs, the coronavirus still leaves more unanswered questions about which school is the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite having visited before, it’s different once you get accepted and actually need to consider if you can see yourself living there for the next four years … and seeing if UCSB or any other school feels comfortable to me,” Hoefs said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coronavirus has definitely made it harder to choose a school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ian O’Connor, a Half Moon Bay High student, said he is leaning toward choosing the school due to its coastal atmosphere. Connor resides in Half Moon Bay, a small coastal town in Northern California, and hopes that the similarity in atmosphere between his hometown and Santa Barbara will make the choice a good fit.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing as UCSB is a pretty, coastal school, I’m probably going to go there because it isn’t going to be too much of a culture shock,” O’Connor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But others, like Campbell, are resorting to other unusual methods to help them pick what colleges they will attend come fall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I posted two videos [on Tik Tok], one for UCSB and one for UCSD. Whichever one gets more views and likes, in theory, that’s the one I’ll pick. It’s mostly a joke,” Campbell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But honestly, it’s the best method of picking that I’ve come up with so far. I have no idea where I’m going to college.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Faculty were tasked with piecing together curriculum for online courses in only two weeks’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said that one of the major problems brought by the transition to remote instruction is UCSB’s lack of experience teaching online classes. The first time the Department of Communication ever offered an online major class was last year, when the University of California Office of the President offered grants for faculty to develop online courses, according to Dunbar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took me months to prepare it. I video recorded lectures, I thought carefully about pedagogy and how faculty can teach online without meeting the students,” Dunbar explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, with the pressure of all classes being taught online, the time to carefully develop courses is quickly dwindling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To just [prepare online courses] instantly overnight … We are not going to have that same kind of thoughtful pedagogy. It’s basically like, ‘What can we do to make sure that students get the information that we want them to get and what can we do to do the best that we can for students without letting them fall through the cracks?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said there is going to be a lot of trial and error for professors as they experiment with new tools and instruction methods that some have never used before, like Zoom for example. To aid one another in the transition to digital classrooms, professors across the country have even created a Facebook group — aptly named </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2528669267346197/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandemic Pedagogy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — to ask for teaching advice and to share tips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge of moving classes online is further complicated by the ongoing </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/breaking-ucsb-graduate-students-vote-to-begin-full-strike-on-thursday-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of living adjustment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (COLA) strikes from graduate students across the UC system. At UCSB, graduate students have been striking since Feb. 27 to demand a COLA to offset high housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question remains as to how graduate students striking for COLA — some of whom have ceased all grading, office hours and teaching — will adjust in the move to online classes. Dunbar said she believes each faculty member will handle the situation differently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, language departments and programs face a unique problem as instructors struggle to find a way to translate rigorous, interactive and almost daily instruction into a digital platform, according to Valentina Padula, coordinator of the Italian Language Program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padula said the program has an advantage compared to other language courses thanks to hybrid online classes that were already being offered by the department. Elements from the hybrid classes, such as visual materials and grammar tutorials, will be implemented into the fully online classes, Padula said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for regular lectures, Padula said that instructors will most likely use Zoom to teach classes. Instructors can also use Zoom to conduct various break-out sessions and hold dialogues — often required for oral exams — between smaller groups of students before reconvening as a class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some language programs in particular will face even more challenges, such as those that teach an alphabet other than the Latin alphabet, according to Magda Campo, an Arabic language lecturer. For Campo, having students continuously practice writing in Arabic is essential to learning and will be difficult to monitor in online classes, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/facing-a-digital-spring-quarter-ucsb-preps-faculty-for-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom workshops</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, students can be given the option to use the whiteboard feature to draw the characters of the alphabet to help meet this requirement, Campo said. She also said she is looking into various programs, such as Adobe and ProctorU, to supplement her normal teaching style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have to understand that the professors are nervous, that [we] are just trying our best to reassure the students that we will do our best to [teach] via Zoom,” Campo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from remote instruction, a closed UCSB campus means students will also lose access to a number of university resources, such as laboratories, which are needed to carry out experiments in many S.T.E.M. fields.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claudio Campagnari, professor and chair of the Department of Physics, said the department had multiple options for holding remote labs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option is to provide students with the measurements of the labs and ask for the data analysis, he said. Another option is for students to buy lab kits, conduct the experiments themselves and then later discuss the results via video conferencing, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain courses and upper division labs in the physics department that are normally considered prerequisites will be waived “to protect the students” from not fulfilling requirements needed for graduation, Campagnari said. There will also be the possibility of offering the course labs online during the summer “if things are not back to normal,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Campagnari also voiced concern about managing students all around the world, as time zones, censorship and internet access in different areas can hamper professors’ efforts to teach their students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professors across the departments are attempting to mitigate any possible negative effects on students, particularly those who are graduating. Within the Writing Program, graduating seniors and students relying on financial aid will be given priority for classes, as those two groups will be the most heavily impacted, Madeleine Sorapure, director of the program, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all departments, however, have been able to find alternative solutions to conducting courses amidst UCSB’s campus closure.

But international students, who compose 14% of the campus population, face the possibility that if they leave the country, they won’t be able to return.<em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if she could go back home, there was the looming possibility that she would either contract the virus while there or be denied reentry into the United States, and thus be unable to return to UCSB, she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall Quarter 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are 3,261 international undergraduate students attending UCSB — composing 14% of the campus population — as well as 914 international graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these international students are in the same situation as Xu — unable to return to their home countries, but unable to remain in the dorms without paying the $300 spring break housing fee. UCSB’s Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), a student organization that advocates for the interests of international students on campus, is working to alleviate that financial burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles K. Neumann, a fourth-year global studies and political science double major and co-founder and internal chair of GGC, explained that the organization made it a priority to push for housing vouchers for all students whose travel plans had been altered by the coronavirus, beginning in February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a survey conducted by the GGC of 100 Chinese students currently living in residence halls on campus, more than half of the respondents planned to either return to China or remain at a friend’s house or a hotel during spring break, Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But those results were from Week 6 of winter quarter, he noted, and “there are definitely students who are still having difficulty [with] finding places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative housing options that are currently available at UCSB are limited; students needing temporary housing must apply through the </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/resources/housing/emergency-transitional-housing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Crisis Response Team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FCRT), which approves each housing request one at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is a more universal kind of deal where all students who are affected by the coronavirus [are] being given housing vouchers,” Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But according to Neumann, the process of advocating for spring break housing vouchers for any students, international or otherwise, is not an easy process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two weeks of continuous back and forth with the administration — including a trip to Cheadle Hall to speak with an absent Chancellor Henry T. Yang, multiple attempts at talking to the Division of Student Affairs and a petition — the GGC was eventually directed to Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE), according to Neumann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been copying from one contact source to another,” Neumann said. “And initially, we kind of felt like they were just passing us along, to kind of shift responsibility to somebody else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 21, HDAE sent an email to students living in university-owned housing to offer them the opportunity to stay in their current dorm during spring break given “an extenuating circumstance due to the travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, students who opt for this extra week of housing must still pay the fee. Neumann argued that since the cost originates from “a circumstance that is completely beyond anybody’s control,” the GGC still plans to meet with Garry Mac Pherson, the vice chancellor for administrative services, to discuss waiving the fee entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GGC is exploring alternative payment avenues in the event that UCSB does not waive the housing fee, Peter Feng, a second-year economics major and external chair of the GGC, said. According to Feng and Neumann, potential options include reimbursements after spring break from either the organization or A.S., a food-specific waiver for eating out in local establishments when the dining commons are closed during break and housing waivers from the FCRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing that the administration cannot provide, Xu said, is certainty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [courses become] online, we are kind of worried whether we should go back to China or just stay here,” Xu said. At the time, UCSB had only announced that classes would take place remotely </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rather than through the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “We’ll just wait and see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a growing concern … of international students not being able to go home and not being able to reenter the United States,” Neumann said, which could force international students to stay in the U.S. during the summer and possibly prevent new international students from entering the country in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“International students are being overlooked in terms of resources and just care, compared to domestic students,” Neumann said. “Even now, international students are still receiving inadequate support from the university administration compared to what they deserve.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the following days, weeks and months have in store, Xu expressed that this situation was not ideal for anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all hope we can get over with this, right?” she said. “I hope everything could get back to normal as soon as possible.”</span></p><div

During the demonstration, approximately 25 students dressed in all black laid down in the plaza — representing an oil spill — while speakers around them read poems and spoke about the dangers of oil drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her speech, Prufer referenced two Santa Barbara oil spills — the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/pipe-spills-21000-gallons-of-oil/\">2015 Plains pipeline spill at Refugio State Beach</a> and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, the latter of which launched the modern environmental movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early March demonstration was organized by CALPIRG to draw attention to the damage oil spills can cause. Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/781040252/california-governor-cracks-down-on-fracking-requires-audits-and-scientific-revie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduced a moratorium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019 that prohibits new high-pressure cyclic steaming extraction wells, requires permits that will be closely examined for adherence to new environmental regulations and introduces new rules for public safety, according to Chloe Kerr-Stein, a first-year writing &amp; literature major who works with CALPIRG. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the organization hopes to convince Newsom to ban oil drilling completely; the group met with him at the beginning of winter quarter with the hope of convincing him to do just that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Newsom] wanted to see overwhelming student support for the issue. So that’s what we’re showing him with these emails, with the people who came out today,” Kerr-Stein said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Jagger, the organizer for CALPIRG’s 100% renewable energy campaign, said she believes now is the time to divest from fossil fuels and do away with oil and gas drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “In the time of climate catastrophe, it doesn’t make sense to further the issue by drilling for a resource that we know isn’t renewable and that is actively harming our planet,” she said. “We already have momentum towards a renewable energy future, and we should be continuing to shift towards greener energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her speech, Prufer also expressed concern that ExxonMobil </span><a href=\"https://keyt.com/news/local-politics/2019/11/13/santa-barbara-county-voters-oppose-exxonmobil-drilling-plan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to restart three oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want to revive the threat of another catastrophic oil spill on our coast and in order to restart these platforms, they want to truck up to 70 truckloads of oil per day on California’s coast,” she said. “They want to do this for several years while they wait for Plains, the company that spilled in the first place, to rebuild that dirty pipeline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to California’s position as one of the leading states in environmentalism, Kerr-Stein stressed the importance of Californians taking action for environmental justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“California is a really big player in just what other states do,” Kerr-Stein said. “One state tries something out, everyone sees that and they’re like, ‘Oh, it works for them.’ And then more states adopt it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prufer said she encouraged students to spread the word on social media, reach out to Gov. Newsom and urge the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to prevent offshore oil drilling in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagger added that she believes students “need to act quickly” to help prevent any further damage from climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re already seeing the effects of climate change in fires raging across the Amazon, the Arctic, central Africa and Australia. We’re seeing continually shrinking sea ice and we’re also seeing intensifying weather events like Hurricane Dorian, which was the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas,” Jagger said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/","id":1846,"author":{"id":261,"name":"Megan Ramsey"},"related":[1845,1844,1843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC President Extends Employees’ Paid Leave With Executive Order","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Campus_Sophia-Lovell_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Campus_Sophia-Lovell_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Paid leave hours be used only in specific circumstances, such as if employees are subject to shelter-in-place orders, or if family members or themselves are exhibiting coronavirus symptoms.

This decline mainly affected the UC campuses of Davis, Los Angeles, Merced, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, other UC campuses such as Berkeley and San Diego experienced a relatively modest increase, particularly UC Irvine, with a boost from 95,556 in 2019 to 97,916 in 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, freshmen applications decreased to 90,947, compared to 93,423 in 2019; the number of California and international applications fell, while out-of-state applications experienced a minor increase of 453, according to the data. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, transfer applications rose from 41,120 in 2019 to 43,063 in 2020, a 4.8% rise over 2018, with every single UC campus experiencing this growth.

The number of applicants at the highest academic profile increased this year while students in lower academic bands decreased,” Przekop noted. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93612\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/uc-freshmen-applications-decrease-for-a-second-consecutive-year-transfer-applications-rise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93612\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/uc-freshmen-applications-decrease-for-a-second-consecutive-year-transfer-applications-rise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/uc-freshmen-applications-decrease-for-a-second-consecutive-year-transfer-applications-rise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/uc-freshmen-applications-decrease-for-a-second-consecutive-year-transfer-applications-rise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/uc-freshmen-applications-decrease-for-a-second-consecutive-year-transfer-applications-rise/","id":1844,"author":{"id":276,"name":"Daniel Seo"},"related":[1843,1842,1841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LIVE: Updates on Coronavirus in Santa Barbara County, on UC Santa Barbara Operations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-03-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0347.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0347.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This post will be updated daily.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to help UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents keep up with the Nexus’ coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and how the university has changed its day-to-day operations in response, below is a summary of the coverage surrounding the coronavirus.

If it does apply, the lease would have to be cancelled in its entirety, meaning all residents would have to vacate, not just the ones who wish to move out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Parents and students] aren’t understanding exactly what they’re reading. Some of it depends on state to state because every state has different laws. This isn’t a federal law. In California, if there’s nothing in your contract that supports, ‘Hey, if there is an act of God situation, then you can excuse yourself from your contract,’ then it doesn’t apply,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second term Unander said she has seen used is called a breach of habitability, which can be used if the location is unfit for human occupation or affects the safety of the tenants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Unander said this term also does not apply because the decision to cancel classes, as well as the spread of the virus, “doesn’t make the house uninhabitable,” even if an Isla Vistan is diagnosed with the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The water works, the electricity works, the heating works, the lighting works — assuming there are no problems with the apartment to begin with. But otherwise, the fact that they might be self-quarantining or being quarantined does not make the unit uninhabitable,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be impossible for residents to break their leases, Unander noted that, depending on the specific lease, tenants can find someone to temporarily or permanently take their places, although Unander emphasized that there is a difference between the two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is temporarily taking the original tenant’s place — for example, if the original tenant goes abroad or spends the summer away from Santa Barbara — the temporary tenant is considered a subleaser. The subleaser reports to the original tenant and the original tenant reports to the landlord, Unander said; the original tenant is responsible for the actions of the subleaser.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more permanent situation, where a new tenant takes over the lease completely, the original tenant is “assigning” all of their rights and interests to the person taking their place, meaning the security deposit changes hands and the original tenant will no longer have any relationship with the landlord, Unander explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. residents must check their leases to see what their landlords’ policies are on allowing replacements, Unander said, adding that landlords have the “absolute right” to say that tenants cannot sublease, or that tenants cannot have someone take their places unless they have the landlord’s written consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tenants leave and refuse to pay their rent, or if they sublease without the landlord’s prior consent, landlords are well within their rights to pursue legal action against the tenant, Unander warned. </span></p>\n<p>She emphasized in the memo that the decision “to not let you out of your lease is not personal or intended to take advantage of the situation.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please keep in mind that most landlords have mortgages and bills to pay arising from your apartment, regardless of whether you are currently occupying it. Most or all cannot afford to cancel your lease and absorb loss of rents,” Unander wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be nearly impossible for I.V. residents to break their leases, UCSB-specific Facebook groups have been flooded with posts from students looking to sublease their rooms for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joana Gutierrez, a third-year history of public policy and feminist studies double major, said she couldn’t justify the cost of rent in I.V. when she had the option to move home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I’m not gonna be here, why am I gonna pay overpriced rent, you know?” she said, adding that she felt like she needed a break from I.V. culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everybody’s super excited about not having classes face-to-face, but that leads to a lot of binge drinking, and it’s stuff that I’m really trying to stay away from for my mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she hasn’t had luck in finding a subleaser yet, Gutierrez said she has mostly been asking her friends who live in university housing, versus looking for someone on social media. Gutierrez added that her roommate also hadn’t found a subleaser but has already gone home and would continue to pay rent through his financial aid refund check.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people are probably gonna be doing that, and that’s probably what I’m gonna end up doing if I don’t find a subleaser, but financially, it would be better to find someone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other I.V. residents are planning on staying in Santa Barbara for the duration of the quarter, citing harmful home environments, jobs or other responsibilities in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and Associated Students (A.S.) senator, said he was staying in I.V. to continue working and to avoid a “toxic” home environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While my job is kind of up in the air, whether it will be completely open or how we can get hours, I just don’t have a job back home and that means I won’t be able to make money to pay my rent,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Additionally, home is just not super healthy,” he said. “The idea of being there for an extended period of time that’s not just a break sounds pretty bad for my mental health.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler Ferguson, a second-year pre-political science major and another A.S. senator, said that in addition to staying because he was “locked into [his] lease,” he wanted to be able to continue carrying out his senatorial duties and supporting other students staying in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson noted that for him, staying in I.V. instead of finding a subleaser — which would require him to pay $500 to his landlord — was the best economic decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m also wanting to get a job out here,” he said. “Being low-income, I definitely need work, and back home there’s not really many jobs available.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
