(Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Principal Researcher of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City Alicia Civera Cerecedo presented a lecture in HSSB on Monday night about the 2014 mass kidnapping of Ayotzinapa students in Iguala, Mexico, and giving a historical account of government corruption surrounding the incident.</p>\n<p>Titled “The Ayotzinapa Student Massacre and the Rural Teacher Training Schools in Mexico: A Historical Perspective,” the event drew around 100 attendees and covered the history of Mexico’s teacher training schools and the September disappearances of 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher’s College of Ayotzinapa. Cerecedo discussed the social movement that arose in Mexico after the kidnappings, the history of teacher training schools in Mexico and baseless narratives that are being forced onto teachers’ reputations by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of the population in Mexico over the age of 15 are in a situation of “lack of education or of not being fully educated,” and people who reside in rural areas have an average education of 6.4 years, according to Cerecedo. She also said Mexican youth are forced to enter cities or migrate to the U.S. because of acute poverty in rural Mexico, and many face challenging economic circumstances and must resort to the drug trade to survive.</p>\n<p>“The civil society is in a state of disbelief and the judicial process day-to-day becomes more apparent that it has been impeded,” said Cerecedo.</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, drug traffickers provide health services and security when the state fails to do so; however the line between government protection and drug cartel protection is becoming increasingly blurred. Cerecedo said drug trafficking is clearly becoming more integrated into the government entity.</p>\n<p>“In the case of Iguala, it became patently clear that drug trafficking is at all levels and in all types of government,” Cerecedo said. “Municipal, state, federal — in the executive, judicial and legislative. In the army as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the Mexican government is using corrupt forms of control and abusing their power by projecting societal problems of illiteracy and poverty onto the teachers. Cerecedo said the Mexican media, which is strictly controlled by the PRI regime, also blames teachers for the failures of the education system.</p>\n<p>Chaos surrounding the education system makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the Ayotzinapa Student Massacre, Cerecedo said.</p>\n<p>“The disappearance of the students happens at a time when you have social conflict and increasing social violence and an economic crisis all coming together,” Cerecedo said. “And it’s at a time when teachers are putting face against PRI authority or challenging the PRI.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the PRI came into power two years ago and has since targeted all opposing political parties or ideologies with hostility.</p>\n<p>“[The PRI] identifies all political parties as a political class without ideas,” Cerecedo said, “[They] are distributing power among themselves which results in a lot of corruption.”</p>\n<p>Cerecedo ended the lecture by saying that Mexico’s political system is essentially based on a “Constitution of a political system that no longer guards the people.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor in the history department and event translator Gabriela Soto Laveaga said she hopes the story of the missing students was thought-provoking for students on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s powerful because … the students who disappeared are your age,” Laveaga said. “I think that’s really poignant. Forty-three people disappeared and were tortured because they were studying.”</p>\n<p>Laveaga said the lecture highlighted to her the vital role student activists play in implementing social change.</p>\n<p>“I think we tend to be really disconnected out here. Sometimes we forget that in most countries its students are the activists,” Laveaga said. “It’s students who are really involved with social change. And maybe Mexico is not that far — it’s our neighbor to our south. And we could be a little more aware of the power of university students in other parts of the world.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Karla Estrada said she attended the event to get a different perspective on the events that unfolded during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to the event because I was aware of the massacre in Iguala and I wanted to get a first-hand account from the professor who is directly from Mexico City,” Estrada said. “She obviously has a really different perspective from professors here in the UC. A lot of my professors talk about what happened, but I felt like I just wanted to get her input.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Kreg Zaragoza said listening to Cerecedo’s lecture first-hand perspective was akin to receiving “insider information.”<br>\n“It’s good to hear from someone who is actually from Mexico,” Zaragoza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

evening to inspect light posts and light bulbs on campus in an effort to make the university safer and more light-efficient.</p>\n<p>UCPD officers, university staff, administrators, professors, students and Campus Security Officers (CSO) participated in the event with the goal of making the university a more secure environment at night. The event split participants into three groups and covered three different walking routes: behind Davidson Library; from Girvetz Hall to the Student Resource Building (SRB); near the bus loop and the RecCen. Each group was led by a UCPD officer, two university staff members and two CSOs.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher said safety involves “adequate lighting” on campus, and Administrative Services strives to address lighting issues every year.</p>\n<p>“It is very important for people to feel safe within the community,” Fisher said. “We have been working on new lighting projects for the past twelve years, since I have personally been here.”</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, old round light bulbs, also called “Johnny Balls,” will be replaced in every walkway with newer and stronger white lighting.</p>\n<p>“We have replaced fixtures such as Johnny Balls,” Fisher said. “Our goal is to have most of those replaced throughout the walkways. We want a whiter light everywhere and we see lighting deficiency right now, but it will be improved.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university is installing new lighting because the currently-placed bulbs are an outdated brand that contribute to light pollution.</p>\n<p>“The old Johnny Balls were created in the 1960s, but we are replacing the old style fixtures,” Fisher said. “These globe lights produce sky globes, and one of the goals of the campus is to change this because in an environmental perspective, it spills light into the sky for color rendition and we want light on the ground as opposed to the sky.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD Patrol Sergeant Matt Blime said bright lighting prevents crime from occurring on campus and allows students to feel more safe on campus at night.</p>\n<p>“I think proper lighting on campus is a deterrence for crime,” Blime said. “If a person is looking to commit a crime, it is less likely that they will do it in an area that is very well lit. At the same time, it gives students more of a sense of safety and security while walking on the campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Blime, serious crimes on campus have been less frequent over the past year due to student participation in safety-related events.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote safety, for everyone here,” Blime said. “We have had a reduction of serious crime in the past year. We have had a 10-20 percent decrease in crimes and it has become more popular for students to participate in these walks and create more safety because we address concerns.”</p>\n<p>Campus Senior Electrical Utility Lead Jim Morrison said a person’s facial expression is more visible under whiter light, which would expose the intentions of a potential perpetrator before a crime is committed.</p>\n<p>“We want more white light,” Morrison said. “During the summer months, they stay on for nine hours and 13 hours in the winter time. If you have a whiter light, you can see facial expressions more. Before a crime, you can see if people look ticked-off and this light makes it possible to see.”</p>\n<p>Biology graduate student graduate Emily Ellis said it is discomforting to walk to her car at night in the dark after late classes.</p>\n<p>“The animals that I study are nocturnal,” Ellis said. “I am happy to stay for experiments, but it is unnerving when it is pitch black and I am the only person on campus. I definitely walk faster and only go towards areas where it is well-lit.”</p>\n<p>Ellis said she worries about her students’ safety when they leave her class at 10 p.m. because the Life Sciences Building currently does not have sufficient lighting due to construction at Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>“It is good to see what is around you and to feel safe as if you are in your own home,” Ellis said. “I worry for them because you never know what can happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, administrators and police officers have demonstrated throughout the years that they are invested in ensuring student safety.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is really assuring that people care about the student concerns. It seems like the administrators and UCPD officers really care about the opinions of students. The survey that was sent out via email recently is an example of this as well.”</p>\n<p>CSO officer and fourth-year Chican@ studies major Melissa Cruz said theft is the most common crime on campus. According to her, theft occurs frequently because darkness facilitates stealing.</p>\n<p>“I have been a CSO for three years and the lights have always been important,” Cruz said, “It brightens up the campus and deters people from stealing things. Stealing is the biggest issue here at UCSB, especially stealing bikes.”</p>\n<p>Cruz said CSO flashlights can only do so much to prevent theft at night and that the new installation of lights will help significantly more in preventing crime.</p>\n<p>“If somebody looks suspicious, we only flash our lights at them,” Cruz said. “But if there are lights then it can prevent them from stealing bikes.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/","id":2873,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2872,2871,2870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Hosted by A.S. President Ali Guthy and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau, the forum informed students about and addressed questions regarding the proposed plan.</p>\n<p>According to Lau, students who currently receive financial aid are allocated around $2,600 to cover health insurance costs no matter whether or not they waive GHI, which is the reason behind the financial office’s plan to reduce aid.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who have a certain need level all get financial aid for GHI at $2,600. Even though your expenses are less, even if you waive out, you still get that much if you’re the same need level as someone who still participates in Gaucho Health Insurance,” Lau said. “That was the concern that the financial aid office had and that’s why they proposed this new financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Lau said the financial aid office is apprehensive that students will purposely select inadequate health insurances costing significantly less than $2,600 instead of GHI to have excess financial aid money for other non-health purposes.</p>\n<p>“Their main concern was that people were getting so much money, this $2,600 for health insurance, but on average outside of UCSB the amount that you have to pay for health insurance is a lot less than that,” Lau said. “Let’s say its $1,500, so now students have an extra $1,000 so to them, it seemed like the $1,000 was enough to entice someone to essentially get a crap health insurance and they didn’t like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students may still require the excess money to pay for necessities such as rent or food. The financial aid office contends the excess money should be used to provide aid to new students, or to students who previously applied unsuccessfully for aid due to the lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, we were saying that while students are using that extra $1,000 for housing, or for textbooks, or for food, they still need that money,” Guthy said. “But the financial aid office’s argument is that well if we take that $1,000 back, so instead of giving you the $2,600 when your health insurance only costs $1,500 we take $1,000 away, we can spend that money to allocate more financial aid to more students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said aid money is still necessary to cover additional healthcare costs for those without GHI.</p>\n<p>“I would say that even if you are on your parents’ plan that doesn’t mean you don’t have healthcare costs,” Mancini said. “What if you’re on your parents plan and you have to go to the hospital for some reason or you’re on an expensive drug? You’re still paying for healthcare you’re still paying for the price of those drugs or the price of that pay in some way or another.”<br>\nAccording to Guthy, health insurance is required for all students, and the financial aid office’s original proposal would not provide any financial aid money for health insurance unless it is GHI.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially saying, ‘You can either have this health insurance or we’re not going to pay for anything else,’” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Lau said the initial plan would create a health insurance monopoly where students receiving financial aid are essentially forced to choose GHI.</p>\n<p>“It almost seemed like they were monopolizing the health insurance market for all students saying, ‘You have to have GHI to get financial aid for it,’” Lau said.</p>\n<p>A.S. met with the financial aid office for a revised plan, which will involve surveying students to determine a health insurance industry average that students will be given if they choose to waive GHI, instead of the original proposal which would not allocate any money for health costs, according to Guthy.</p>\n<p>“We came up with a preliminary agreement that the financial aid office would pay an industry standard to students who waive out of Gaucho Health Insurance,” Guthy said. “They’re planning to conduct a survey to all students who opt out of Gaucho Health Insurance to see kind of what kinds they have to define what this industry standard is.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said students who choose an insurance plan above the surveyed industry standard can still receive financial aid to cover the difference.</p>\n<p>“If your health insurance happens to be greater than the industry average but below Gaucho Health Insurance you can still go into the financial aid office and get a grant to cover your health insurance,” Guthy said, “All you need to do is come in with a bill and they’ll pay for it.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the financial aid office established the proposal to allocate money more efficiently so that students receive the precise monetary amount they require and no more.</p>\n<p>“The kind of motivation behind this is to make the spending of financial aid more efficient,” Guthy said. “They want you to spend the money to the exact level that you need, they don’t want you to have excess. And they’re arguing if we give you more money for health insurance than you need, that’s excess and we don’t want you to have excess.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Alex Hill said the financial aid office allocates a certain amount of financial aid specifically for health purposes, and any excess portion of that amount not being used for health is deemed wasteful by the financial aid office.</p>\n<p>“You have a lot of students who are either shopping on the market and getting a cheaper plan, or are on their parents plan and ultimately their costs are reduced. Students are having say between $500 and $1,000 per year extra money that is not going to health costs,” Hill said. “According to the financial aid office, based off their breakdown, technically we’re wasting money, so we need to adjust our standards so it’s more strict.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/","id":2878,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2877,2876,2875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prof. Discusses Pros, Cons of Fracking","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"University of Wyoming Economics Professor and UW Chair in Petroleum and Natural Gas Economics Charles Mason gave a lecture at Bren Hall titled \"To Frack or Not to Frack?” in which he discussed some ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61005\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61005\" data-attachment-id=\"61005\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/prof-discusses-pros-cons-of-fracking/mason-fracking-talk_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=4272%2C2848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4272,2848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424178325\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mason Fracking Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61005\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"University of Wyoming professor Charles Mason discusses the pros and cons of fracking last night.

Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into underground rock in order to force it open and extract oil or gas. Mason specializes in Environmental and Resource Economics and is an associate editor of the <em>European Economic Review</em>, co-editor of the <em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</em> and joint editor-in-chief of <em>Strategic Behavior in the Environment.</em></p>\n<p>Mason began his lecture by addressing the economic advantages behind fracking such as increased employment from fracking-related jobs as well as an increase in the supply of natural gas for consumers worldwide.</p>\n<p>“With this kind of expansion in production you have a large increase in supply,” Mason said. “That generally means two things to people who use natural gas — greater ability and lower prices. This is the kind of thing that politicians would naturally glom onto.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, another advantage brought on by fracking includes a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>“This big increase in the production of natural gas has lead to a displacement of coal as a source for producing electricity, which in turn means a reduction of carbon emissions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>However, Mason said the potential water contamination caused by hydraulic reinjection is a major concern regarding fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“A particular amount of the angst about fracking, I think, has to do with the potential for groundwater contamination,” Mason said. “The contaminated water that comes from the frack job is the larger consideration.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61006\" style=\"width:

the incomplete record keeping on the part of natural gas companies.</p>\n<p>“Until relatively recently, there was considerable lack of transparency about what was being done,” Mason said. “We don’t know what’s in the chemical compounds that are being used as part of the frack job, we don’t know how dangerous it is … we don’t know whether or not we should worry about this getting into our groundwater.”</p>\n<p>Mason also said his research on water contamination, which is his focus regarding his studies on fracking in Sublette County, Wyoming, has shown him the extent of companies’ inadequacy in reporting fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“There’s asymmetric information,” Mason said. “The firms that are undertaking these jobs know exactly what they’re injecting, but we know nothing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, he uses company reports to research the consequences of fracking, and his findings have shown that some potentially toxic ingredients of the fracking process are left out as “trade secrets.”</p>\n<p>“They do have specific information of the ingredients that were used, subject to trade secrets exceptions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>First-year student in the Bren School master’s program Leah Fine said Mason’s lecture reinforced material she has learned in her environmental policy classes.</p>\n<p>“Especially since being at Bren, I’ve become more interested in the production of groundwater resources,” Fine said. “It was a cool tie-in with some of the curriculum here at the Bren School, and I thought it was really interesting to hear how different companies disclose information.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year student in the Bren School master’s program Hye Min Park, it was useful to hear about the practical applications of fracking outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>“This is a really specific issue that I don’t always get to learn about in lectures,” Park said, “I thought it was really interesting to see how it is applied in the real world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Pakistan Marc Grossman visited campus this past Friday to speak to students at the global studies department about his 30-year career with the U.S. Foreign Service.</p>\n<p>As a former diplomat and government official, Grossman also worked as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, which is the State Department’s third ranking official. As Under Secretary, Grossman assembled diplomatic support for the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan he supported the Afghan peace process and worked to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations.</p>\n<p>Grossman, who was born in Los Angeles, received a degree in political science from UCSB, and said one of his professors saw his potential after two years at the university.</p>\n<p>“He arranged for me to go on the Education Abroad Program,” Grossman said. “I’d never left the state of California before, and hours later we landed in London.”</p>\n<p>Grossman then got his master’s degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before returning to Santa Barbara. Grossman said after returning and working in Santa Barbara for several years, he sought a career that would cater to his passion.</p>\n<p>“I came back to Santa Barbara, where I worked for three years — a year in politics and a couple years selling things door to door, which turned out to be great experience,” Grossman said. “One day I said to myself, I have got to find a profession that is going to pay me to live abroad and be curious about how other people live.”</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, he passed the Foreign Service exam at UCSB, then the oral exam at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, and in March of 1976 joined the Foreign Service and moved to the East Coast.</p>\n<p>Grossman said one of his biggest accomplishments during his time in the Foreign Service was working to dissuade the Turkish government from using torture when handling prisoners.</p>\n<p>“We were able to convince Turks that this kind of abuse — the systematic abuse of people — was just wrong,” Grossman said.</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, diplomacy is always changing, and he is excited to see college students majoring in fields like global studies and considering international careers.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing so fast, and these interactions are changing so fast,” Grossman said. “I teach to a lot of brand new American diplomats, and I envy them. They are really going to lead our engagement in the world for a very long time to come.”</p>\n<p>Grossman said students today are lucky to have more opportunities in the international field than he had when he started his career.</p>\n<p>“If you wanted to live that kind of life, diplomacy was basically the only way to do it,” Grossman said. “The choices that you all now have with non-governmental organizations, with charities, with multilateral organizations, with businesses, with more ways that people are today employed abroad, are very exciting prospects.”</p>\n<p>Grossman also said he hopes some students will consider a career in diplomacy for the United States.</p>\n<p>“I hope you really will consider representing the United States,” Grossman said. “There’s no substitute for working in an office where you have the American flag flying.”</p>\n<p>Global Studies Professor Eve Darian-Smith said Grossman gave students insight into a career path many global studies students are considering to pursue.</p>\n<p>“The visit from former Ambassador Marc Grossman was very exciting and granted our Global Studies students a glimpse into the life of a leading diplomat working at the frontlines of U.S. foreign policy in extremely difficult political contexts,” Darian-Smith said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Edixon Puglisi said it is important that those who are “experts of their craft” convey their experiences to students.</p>\n<p>“It is very important to pass down to new generations the keys to success in each field of study, as well as the experiences of success and failure in each field, in such a way so that we may learn from our mistakes and become more efficient and effective individuals in society,” Puglisi said.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Harrison Marshall said listening Grossman’s talk actually helped him finalize his decision to apply to work for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“For me personally it gave me a lot of perspective on what I want to be pursuing with my life,” Marshall said. “Because of the visit I’m most definitely going to be applying for the State, which is something I had only considered before.”</p>\n<p>According to Darian-Smith, the Q&amp;A session following Grossman’s talk gave many students insight into the nuances of a career in foreign diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“It was a unique opportunity for students to ask the Ambassador direct questions, which he answered with candor, grace and humor,” Darian-Smith said. “Students’ minds were opened up to the contradictions and unpredictability of navigating foreign relations across different cultures, religions and worldviews, and the visit provided an invaluable ‘real-life’ teaching moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Riley’s Facebook and Twitter posts, this caused university staff and faculty, including Black Studies professor Gaye Theresa Johnson, to reverse the decision and allow The Coup to perform.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said The Coup had difficulty with the university’s insurance policy because campuswide insurance carrier Campus Connexxus does not provide coverage for hip hop artists. According to Armistead, hip-hop artists in the past have been able to perform because they had their own insurance, but The Coup did not.</p>\n<p>“The insurance carrier does not provide coverage for hip-hop,” Armistead said in an email. “When this is the case, the artists that want to come to campus must supply their insurance coverage. The Coup does not have its own insurance.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said the MCC’s request that the insurance requirement be waived so The Coup could play was originally denied, but that she then worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to get the requirement waived.</p>\n<p>“When I learned that a waiver was denied I worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to correct the decision,” Armistead said in an email. “Once it was deemed that there was no security issue with the group coming to campus, the decision to not waive the insurance requirement was reversed.

Chapel Hill police are conducting an investigation to see if the shooting was in any way related to the victims’ religion or ethnicity.

said the shooting is a manifestation of recent Islamophobic sentiments in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“This comes at a time when Islamophobia had become all too clear in the way conversations are held and how the media reports the news,” Jishi said.</p>\n<p>According to Jishi, the incident highlights discriminatory treatment of Muslims purported by some mass media outlets.</p>\n<p>“A Muslim-American Human Rights lawyer was asked on CNN whether he supported ISIS,” Jishi said. “This creates an atmosphere where hatred towards Muslims can become prevalent for no other reason than the God they worship or the attire they choose.”</p>\n<p>Jishi also said the MSA views the three students “as our brothers and sisters in faith,” and that the candlelight vigil aimed to bring attention to the Islamophobic sentiment that pervades even college campuses.</p>\n<p>Whitney Triplett, a third-year psychology major who attended the event, said the vigil helped create a space in which students could be informed about what happened in Chapel Hill as well as be supportive of the victim’s families.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for these types of stories to get out and be made public,” Triplett said. “It’s important to come out and make a statement and let these peoples’ families know that even from here in California we mourn with them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said students living in Isla Vista last Spring can relate the incident at Chapel Hill.</p>\n<p>“Here at UCSB we know what it’s like to lose students,” Sallak said.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman from Santa Barbara Hillel was present at the vigil and said he attended in order to mourn with a fellow religious community on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m very sensitive to both the trauma of these kind of horrible murders at a college campus,” Goodman said. “Especially when it involves a religious community.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, solidarity among religious communities is especially vital in the midst of instances of hate crime.</p>\n<p>“If there was even a hint of this being a bias or hate crime then we need to stand together,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_60874\" style=\"width: 610px\"

The economics department has not yet decided specific areas for allocating the $5 million.</p>\n<p>Economics Department manager Kenneth Freeland said the donations from Aster have been cumulatively given to the university through his estate, and the main gift came this past December and consisted of $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>“This is coming through in all sort of varying amounts over time,” Freeland said. “They range from about 100k to around 4 million, so we have gotten several distributions and are expecting more. We got one over Christmas break, which is money we didn’t even know about that came in at about 1.3 million.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, the money will go to an Endowed Chair, to be called the Aster Chair to honor Richard Aster.<br>\n“We can hire a very senior, you know, kind of high level, renowned economist to have an Endowed Chair here with the money,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the Economics Department Kelly Bedard said donor money affects the campus as a whole and not simply the economics department.</p>\n<p>“Donor money is used in a variety of ways on campus broadly — it is not unique to economics — to do a variety of things,” Bedard said. “One thing is to have what are called endowed chairs to attract nationally known scholars and hiring people doing important work in whatever area that we happen to be talking about that is beneficial to the campus and the students.”</p>\n<p>Bedard also said department faculty will decide where the money goes.</p>\n<p>“We give a lot of thought to how it gets allocated and where we think it would have the benefits and so on,” Bedard said. “And of course it is also in consultation with the Dean of Social Science and the Administrators in Cheadle Hall and so on.”</p>\n<p>According to Bedard, economics is among the largest majors at the university and new funds are always welcome.<br>\n“We are certainly one of the biggest if not the biggest,” Bedard said. “I think most years we are the biggest, but you know things do fluctuate.”</p>\n<p>Economics department Academic Personnel Specialist Anne Ellis said the money can be used to host talks for students, and right now they have three lecture series: the Philip Babcock Lecture Fund, the Herb Kay Lecture and the Carl Snyder Memorial Lecture.</p>\n<p>“They all have a different emphasis, so the Babcock one has more of an undergraduate emphasis, so there is a couple undergraduates students who get to choose the speakers so it is more geared towards the undergraduates,” Ellis said. “Herb Kay is more of a business related one, it’s usually a prominent business person, it is not necessary a professor or something, they have a business, and Snyder is usually a very high level economist, so someone famous in the economist world.”</p>\n<p>Freeland said the Graduate Student Administration will be able to make improvements to the facilities and give more financial support to the current 107 graduate students.</p>\n<p>“Some of our offices are going to get new paint and new carpet — so the Administrative Offices, so the facilities — because the university doesn’t have a lot of money to really make fancy facilities,” Freeland said. “Some of the money is going to go to graduate student support, so we are going to spin off some money that we can use to offer to Ph.D. students and to provide financial support for grad students.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, it is because of donors such as Aster that undergraduates have a career center that is unlike those of most campuses.</p>\n<p>“We have an undergraduate career center, which is unusually unique for campuses. Some schools have new graduate career centers — we actually have an undergraduate career center which focuses on our accounting students because even though we are not a business school, the degree is a professional degree and a lot of our students actually have permanent job offers by the end of their junior year,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>A series of lectures will be funded by Aster’s donations towards public lectures for speakers, students, faculty and staff that are free and open to people in the community.</p>\n<p>“The department is doing more public lectures and inviting people in who are business leaders, from alumni who have been very successful and also Nobel Laureates and people who are very famous economists,” Freeland said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-60704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A recent proposal from the Financial Aid Office considers lowering the amount of financial aid that students who have waived Gaucho Health Insurance receive.</p></div>\n<p>The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed plan, students receiving financial aid who waive GHI will receive less money than those who keep university student health insurance and will instead receive aid based on a student survey-based “industry average” determined by the university. UCSB has the most expensive health insurance plan in the UC system at around $2,568 per year ($856 per quarter) for the next academic year, and up to 50 percent of students waive this plan every school year.</p>\n<p>GHI Advisory Committee Budget Officer Mike Anderson said the plan exists to better allocate financial aid resources to students in need.</p>\n<p>“If a student already has insurance then the financial aid office will take that money and give it to others who are financially struggling,” Anderson said. “They need the GHI Plan and can increase their financial aid package. I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy, the Financial Aid Board wrongly assumes students receiving financial aid do not need the money given for health insurance.</p>\n<p>“If you remove the funding for health insurance because you waived the Gaucho Health Insurance does not mean you have the money for health insurance. You may still need that money to pay for the other health insurance,” Guthy said. “Students who waive out of health insurance are not incurring that cost for health insurance or have a family plan.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised. —Andrew Okeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. is currently working with the Financial Aid Office to reach an agreement to avoid cutting the financial aid benefits for student health insurance.</p>\n<p>First-year computer science major Andrew Okeh said he believes the plan does not benefit students and instead profits the university.</p>\n<p>“Since when are less benefits ever good?” Okeh said. “The people who are involved with the board, it’s good for them because providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Navpreet Khabra said she also opposes the proposal because she believes that the aid students receive specifically allocated to health insurance is valuable to students who opt out of GHI.</p>\n<p>“By lowering their financial aid award, it could offset the money that they would have saved,” Khabra said. “I personally was able to use the money saved from waiving GHI for other educational expenses such as textbooks and transportation.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, however, if students waive GHI it implies they have more affordable health insurance plans.</p>\n<p>“If people waive out then they have other health insurance, it’s already in the family budget and calculated for,” Anderson said. “Because they have health insurance, they’ll waive out. There’s a large percentage of students who don’t have health insurance like students overseas. It’s something we’re exploring. It may or may not happen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60837\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60837\" data-attachment-id=\"60837\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/ghi/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=1384%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1384,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"GHI\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=888%2C299&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60837\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI-1024x345.jpg?resize=600%2C202\" alt=\"Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=1024%2C345&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?w=1384&amp;ssl=1 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Guthy, she and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau have reached a compromise with the Financial Aid Board that would allow students to possibly alter their financial aid award under certain financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say the industry average is $1,500 and if you pay more than that, you could go to the financial aid office to adjust that,” Guthy said. “We reached a verbal agreement on our meeting on Friday so I’m pretty sure that’s what we’re doing.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the plan will be ultimately beneficial because it will help students who are financially struggling by expanding the available limits on general financial aid funding.</p>\n<p>“Financial aid offices run out of money. They give out grants and scholarships and then are left with loans. They could give those grants to those who are having a tougher time and I think that would be a good thing,” Anderson said. “I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Paige Donaldson however said the plan is “terrible” because it does not help students save money.</p>\n<p>“I waived the health insurance because I couldn’t afford it, so how would cutting my financial aid do any good?” Donaldson said. “Either way it’s a trap to make us pay more and make money off of us, but students are not to be treated like walking money bags to make a profit.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.<strong> —</strong>Willie Roman</p></blockquote>\n<p>Willie Roman, a first-year English and economics double major said he’s surprised the plan is even being considered.</p>\n<p>“Personally, as a student from a low income household, my financial aid is absolutely critical, and stretched thin as it is,” Roman said. “Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy however, the Financial Aid Board has been open to working with the student body to enact reasonable financial aid policy and are hoping students participate in the upcoming surveys.</p>\n<p>“Financial Aid Office is sending out a survey to gauge the industry average and collect more data. They won’t erase the funding entirely but will lessen it to the industry average,” Guthy said. “We encourage people to do the survey to give students time to prepare for this change. I think we’ve reached a good conclusion.”</p>\n<p>Anderson, said a decision regarding the proposal, whose rising costs are due to the Affordable Health Care Act, will be made in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to wrap it up here in the next few weeks,” Anderson said. “There used to be caps on the benefits of each person. It’s getting expensive because the Affordable Health Care act put no caps on the benefits.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/","id":2922,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2921,2920,2919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President Ali Guthy spoke about a recent Alumni Association meeting in which the possible restructuring of the Division of Student Affairs by moving the location of Career Services to the Alumni Association was discussed.</p>\n<p>“I have to share publicly that I am very opposed to that structural relocation of Career Services,” Guthy said. “Although they were having a preliminary discussion on the idea, I want you to be aware though those discussions are being had.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, she will be meeting with a committee to explore the restructuring further, although no decisions have been made about moving forward with the proposal. Guthy said the move would not solve any existing problems because there is a lack of alumni staff dedicated to Career Services.</p>\n<p>“I am not saying that they couldn’t develop that [staff] over time, but right now they have absolutely no career service,” Guthy said, “I think that it should be controlled by a Department that for years has been focused on undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Vice President Angela Lau updated the Senate on last week’s news that the Student Health Board was considering lowering financial aid given to students not enrolled in the Gaucho Health Insurance plan. Lau said a compromise has been reached that will offer financial aid to students enrolled in a private plan equal to the average insurance costs for students insured outside the university plan.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a standard that takes the average of how much students usually pay for health insurance and that’s how much will be applied towards financial aid, instead of getting like nothing,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also discussed the campus climate survey and said three campus goals regarding increased student services is in progress.</p>\n<p>“The three goals that the University has identified as the most important from that survey were working to create better services for LGBTQ identified students and underrepresented minorities on campus, sexual assault prevention and the aftermath and staff morale,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s meeting, senators also approved a resolution directing the A.S. Ticket Office to undergo the i&gt;clicker rental program, sent the 24 hour café resolution to committee, discussed greener alternatives to blue test booklets and passed the A.S.

The department was recently ranked number one in the country by the online database College Factual ranking last month.</p>\n<p>Sociology Department chair and professor Maria Charles said the conference is aimed at celebrating the milestone while also reflecting upon the department’s work in the field.</p>\n<p>“Our Ph.D. program was founded in the 1964-65 academic year, so one reason is to celebrate the major milestone, and the other reason is to consider UCSB’s Department of Sociology’s intellectual contributions, particularly looking at fields in which we have had [an] intellectual role in over the years,” Charles said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s program, topics that will be presented include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, globalization, ethnography, conversation analysis and social movements. Charles said she is excited to see the presentations on issues that have significant implications for society.</p>\n<p>“The speakers will be reflecting on the development of certain sociological subfields over the past 50 years,” Charles said. “We’re also looking at the impact of the department in terms of contributions to broader social good, because our faculty is very interested in doing research that is socially relevant and that address important social problems of today.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, 10 former department chairs will be attending the event in addition to current sociology professors. Sociology graduate student Corrie Ellis said she decided to help coordinate the event and bring back former faculty for the opportunity to meet past faculty and department chairs and reflect on the

us and especially graduate students to learn about the history of UCSB sociology, which I think is a very radical history and I’m very proud to be part of it.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, after

Clayman, who received his Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology, said he is excited for the graduate program and looks forward to commemorating his alma mater.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to have come from that world-class program and it’s really great that they are now reaching their 50th anniversary,” Clayman said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

According to Harris, the $8,304 funding the BSU received is going toward covering the two-day program and informational documents for parents and students on campus. Harris said the outreach program is the only program that prioritizes African American students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60678\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60678\" data-attachment-id=\"60678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/finance-and-business-committee-hears-from-groups/finance-board-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423457519\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60678\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=334%2C222\" alt=\"Committee members hear students' proposals for funding.

The distinction joins his other honors of being elected to the National Academy of Inventors in 2013 and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he won academy membership because of the advancements he and his research group made in treating patients through medicinal patches on the skin instead of injection with needles.</p>\n<p>“[NAE membership is] really a sort of validation and a culmination of the value of the work that we have been doing,” Mitragotri said. “It’s an encouragement to continue on the same path.”</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Mitragotri is well-deserving of the prestigious election.</p>\n<p>“Election to the Academy by one’s peers is one of the highest recognitions for an engineer, an acknowledgment of outstanding and pioneering research,” Yang said. “This distinction joins a long list of Samir’s other well-deserved honors and accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he believes a large part of his recognition is due to the students and research group members who work with him.</p>\n<p>“I really want to thank my students and my research group,” Mitragotri said. “They are the ones who do the hard work on a day-to-day basis, and the work that is recognized is really their doing.”</p>\n<p>With his membership, Mitragotri said he looks forward to conferring with other engineers on making decisions for the future of the engineering field.</p>\n<p>“It’s really an opportunity to participate in the future discussions of engineering at the national level,” Mitragotri said, “That could really be the key benefit and the key outcome of this election.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Zach Sawaya said Mitragotri’s election is unsurprising, given the reputation of the university’s engineering programs.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest, but it makes me very excited,” Sawaya said. “This appointment is simply an indication of the excellent faculty and students … and a reason we have one of the top chemical engineering departments in the country.”</p>\n<p>“Really, it’s representative of UCSB science as a whole,” Sawaya said. “We are a top science university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I understand we are a beach college but a lot of Greeks are the most intimidated by the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>Escobar-Henry said publicly admitting your sexual orientation as gay can lead to negativity from those who oppose the gay community.</p>\n<p>“I feel that ‘coming out’ is definitely a gateway to have hatred towards you,” Escobar-Henry said. “The hatred comes from ignorance and making jokes out of LGBTQ people in the media and public.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English and film &amp; media studies major Chloe Babauta also spoke on the panel and said because of her bisexual identity she has been followed and verbally assaulted in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One time, I was walking down the street in Isla Vista with a girl,” Babauta said. “I was holding her hand and was followed. Another time, I was with my lesbian friends and men tried to make me make-out with them. I felt threatened and in danger. This is why I do not party in Isla Vista anymore.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/","id":2911,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2910,2909,2908],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":71,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
