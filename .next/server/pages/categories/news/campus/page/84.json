He added that the resignations of eightsenators during Fall quarter were likely due to the extensive length of meetings, which end anytime between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. with last night’s meeting coming to a close at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We figured we needed to change the culture of the Senate,” Kennedy said, referring to himself and Harrison. “I don’t think this bill is an end-all but I think it’s a really good start.”</p>\n<p>Despite the support of several senators, the bill faced adamant opposition from executive officers and some Public Forum speakers. A.S. President Sophia Armen voiced con- cerns about A.S. members’ dedication and accountability, stating that Senate should not be treated as an easy job and senators should willingly listen to the input of all public forum speakers.</p>\n<p>“This job is hard. You should have all known that going in,” Armen said. “In my opinion, the most people we should be listening to are the people who walk in here … If any of you are resigning because of this — that is unacceptable…The reality is, it’s not about enjoying.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segoviap said in her past meetings with A.S. organizations of other schools, there were noticeably fewer resignations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, on-campus senator Kevin Rudolph voiced his support by claiming that other schools had similar time limits, adding that long meetings cause him to question his own dedication to the group.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, to come here, I love what I’m doing but this meeting is most of the time a burden and it’s very unproduc- tive,” Rudolph said. “I know that other schools have time limits or things like that. I would like to see this [bill] passed.”</p>\n<p>In response to such claims, Armen said students should maintain better focus or initiate more efficient practices in meetings instead of simply slashing meeting times.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that half of the discussion going on in this room isn’t even the projects,” Armen said. “Instead of having 25 minutes of discussion on productivity, why not actually be productive?”</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, who acts as the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the A.S. Office of the President, rec- ognized the importance of reducing stress for senators but agreed that longer meetings can be necessary to ensure that all business is finished.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize that there is a need to retain senators and make the job easier,” Lakhani said. “But sometimes a four- and-a-half hour meeting isn’t long enough for Senate business … Your meetings take time and your discussions are tough because that’s the nature of what comes to you.”</p>\n<p>Senators resolved to table — essentially postpone — the bill indefinitely. However, there was agreement that A.S. members would spend time at future meetings brainstorming and discussing new methods of increasing productivity and decreasing meeting length.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 10, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/","id":3104,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3103,3102,3101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Students can then use these lists to find contact information for books they need.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the student-run textbook marketplace is a kickoff for what the A.S. Office of the President hopes will eventually become an institutionalized series of regular student-run buy-back events at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a process, but still, it’s something we’re going to start now,” Armen said. “Buying books is expensive, and we have no control over return for books. There’s pressure with costs everywhere, so this way students can make profits instead of having to go through a middleman or to the university.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board are also engineering a student-run textbook website structured similarly to the textbook advertising hosted on many Facebook group pages.</p>\n<p>“We’re tying to make a mechanism that is like Facebook, but student-run,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>UCen Bookstore employee and third-year biopsychology major Debbie Gee said the marketplace threatens to redirect students and revenue away from the campus’s main textbook retailer.</p>\n<p>“It might detract from the amount of traffic in the UCen,” Gee said. “When people buy textbooks they also buy other things, like pens, pencils and notebooks. So if they buy from somewhere else, sales in general could potentially go down, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the book buy-back will allow students to bypass bookstores and exchange reading material in a much more efficient manner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is, when we consistently go to the university or small companies, books can get expensive because you don’t have other options,” Armen said. “This came out of student organization. We’re creating innovative ideas when the university is putting a burden on our backs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Elizabeth Dang said the traditional process of buying and reselling schoolbooks is time-consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>“When I sought out the buying back process, I would find that buyback prices would be for only 20 percent of the book, which is practically nothing,” Dang said. “And textbook costs are ridiculous — especially since we only use it nine weeks, and in most of my classes we only read two chapters out of like 500 pages.”</p>\n<p>While the bookstore does offer the option to rent books for a cheaper price, Gee said a successful student-run textbook marketplace could end up being a worthy competitor to the university.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure how the prices at this thing will compare to bookstore prices, but lots of students are struggling with finances, and this could detract from sales if it ends up being cheap, efficient and well-run,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board hope the textbook marketplace fuels widespread questioning and analysis regarding the causes of high textbook prices and promotes further student organization to address shared financial issues.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we’re here: inspiring students, making [them a] part of the solution on campus and showing the impact of having things student-run,” Armen said. “We are a community sharing resources.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Though Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores was origi- nally scheduled to attend, she was unable to make an appear- ance due to scheduling conflicts.</p>\n<p>Stein, a UC Berkeley graduate student who is working toward a law degree and a master’s degree in public policy, said the event’s goal was to encourage students to become more involved in and informed about the decisions made at local, statewide and national levels with regard to UC policies.</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, I give voice to student concerns at the highest level of UC administration … I empower students to solve their own problems,” Stein said. “We have to engage our administrators, and what that means is that Student Regents are one part of a much larger student movement that is sort of attacking from all angles.”</p>\n<p>Stein said while protest is often an effective method of communicating with the board, much more is needed to fully engage the administrators and promote widespread change. Some potential ways to take a more noticeable stance include holding advocacy protests on several campuses and lobbying at regents’ meetings, Stein said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Sophia Armen, it is crucial that students recognize their voice on the Board of Regents and work for further representation in committees that allocate large amounts of funding and other resources to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of education that we as students in the UC, who number over 200,000, only have one student vote on the Board of Regents that raise our fees and affect our daily lives,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Stein said Prop. 30 was a huge victory for students, but only a temporary solution for the coming cuts to the UC system. According to Stein, students must re-involve themselves in advocacy efforts for the upcoming 2013-14 year and any future year in order to avoid huge tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“As a result, students have to go back to Sacramento to begin the process of lobbying for another tuition buyout,” Stein said. “We passed Prop. 30 through student voter registration and student voter turnout … now we have to go back and lobby to negate a tuition increase for the second year in a row.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, ensuring the transparent use of funds generated through Prop. 30 is one of many causes that contrib- ute to the importance of “fighting for our right to education as a public good.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science major Sydney Bennet, a campus organizing director for the A.S. External Vice President of Student Affairs, said students need to take action by getting involved with campaigns that speak directly to California legislators and create more opportunities to lobby in support of education.</p>\n<p>“We represent students on statewide, national and UC level, and our goal is to make sure education remains afford- able and accessible,” Bennet said. “This [event] was just the first step.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/","id":3100,"author":{"id":203,"name":"Jennifer Chang"},"related":[3099,3098,3097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also approved the Investment Advisory Committee’s investments and discussed a new plan to make taxi rides more accessible to students with limited funds.</p>\n<p>The Chinese Student Association approached the Senate during public forum requesting approximately $3,000 for their upcoming masquerade ball in downtown Santa Barbara, for which they need transportation, decorations and advertising. They would charge participants $30 each, some of which would go back to the organization.</p>\n<p>Though Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez was reluctant to speak for Finance Board before an official vote, he said they would be concerned about the fee as the event may be considered a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“If the Senate approved the money, it would need to be a one-time exception,” Martinez said. “We would be concerned about the $30 fee. We can’t [fund] decorations, [and] we don’t fund more than $250 for audio,” he added.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Angela Lau noted the differences between a philanthropic event and a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“They aren’t doing philanthropy, so we can’t fund them,” Lau said. “They are selling tickets which are supposed to go back to funding their event. We don’t fund fundraisers.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether CSA had approached other organizations for money, because of their intention to provide an alternative to the Isla Vista party scene, member Angel Chin said they had not been successful.</p>\n<p>“It has been a week past [since we asked for money from After Dark] and we haven’t heard anything from them so I’m not sure we are getting anything,” she said. She had not contacted any other organizations.</p>\n<p>Lao was also concerned about the location of the event.</p>\n<p>“It’s off-campus and we try to keep our funds for on-campus events,” she said. “We only fund events that are for the students.”</p>\n<p>Senators voted to approve zero dollars for the CSA. Senator Ashley Koide wanted to clarify that this was not out of spite.</p>\n<p>“It seems like it’s really bad that we’re giving zero but it’s just a policy thing,” she said.</p>\n<p>After voting against funding the CSA, the Senate voted to approve investments made by the Investment Advisory Committee. The IAC manages the Associated Student’s stock holdings and monitors different companies to decide when to sell and when to invest to make a profit for the student budget. Senators were generally supportive of the IAC’s decisions, but one company’s past legal issues concerned certain members.</p>\n<p>Proxy Senator Will Ellis brought up the potential issues with Kansas City Southern as an investment because of their legal past.</p>\n<p>“[There was a] race-based discrimination lawsuit filed against KCS,” he said. “It’s cool that we got that money [from that investment], but [the suit] should make us reluctant to invest in that company.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alex Choate countered that the suit had been dealt with and was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“Since this issue was resolved, I’d feel comfortable investing in it as long as we make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Senate voted to approve all investments; however, they resolved to keep an eye on KCS in order to prevent association with discriminatory companies.</p>\n<p>In addition, External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia proposed an initiative to provide taxicab rides to students who did not have immediate access to appropriate fare. He said they would need to set up a $5,000 account with the Yellow Cab.</p>\n<p>“It would be a revolving account,” Siordia said. “Students would give the taxi driver their perm number, address, et cetera and then the cab ride would be paid for with [the Yellow Cab account]. [That money would then be] taken from the student’s BARC account and given back to the Yellow Cab fund.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial affairs debated in the meeting, Senators passed changes to the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee’s legal code, the Women’s Committee presented plans to offer regular self-defense classes in the near future and executive officers celebrated the implementation of Proposition 30.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48718\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48718\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/","id":3098,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3097,3096,3095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Discuss Hurricane Relief, I.V.

The Senate also accepted Off-Campus Senator Cory Wheeler’s resignation and decided who would be responsible for finding his replacement.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Andrew Soriano proposed post-Hurricane Sandy clean-up efforts, emphasizing the gravity of the disastrous situation and citing similar fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>“The hurricane pretty much devastated the East Coast,” Soriano said. “I know in the past we have organized efforts with things like Hurricane Katrina.”</p>\n<p>Soriano’s idea was met with support and enthusiasm. Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia suggested a blood drive to help aide shortages in areas heavily affected by the storm.</p>\n<p>“There has been a blood shortage because of so many people being wounded … blood banks have been affected as well,” Segovia said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Segovia also encouraged a partnership with Red Cross to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Miya Sommers said the United States was not the only country to take a beating from Sandy, reminding the Senate that some other affected countries do not have the infrastructure to bounce back quickly after such a storm.</p>\n<p>Another proposed project dealt with Isla Vista’s lack of appropriate lighting. Off-Campus Senators Alex Choate and Kaitlyn Christianson are working on a resolution to make I.V. brighter, which they defended at the meeting. Christianson said the resolution, which entails filing a work order for each defunct bulb in I.V., is a simple solution to a pressing issue.</p>\n<p>“[This is] something that we’ve needed for years and it [has] not [been] able to get done because of funding,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Senators discussed Proposition 30 and the consequences that would accompany its failure, as they have at every meeting for the past few weeks. There will be continued efforts to advocate Proposition 30’s significance to the student body before Tuesday’s election.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/","id":3102,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3101,3100,3099],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Each brigade disperses medical supplies to a village until replaced by the next brigade the following month.</p>\n<p>This year’s UCSB dispatch will take place June 17 to 27 and focus on two different communities in Ghana’s Abuakwa region.</p>\n<p>UCSB GMB Treasurer Paola Cardenas, a fourth-year biology major, said $2,000 of the student funds would supply malaria medication and the rest would finance other medication including painkillers, antibiotics and vitamins, while participants would personally cover all other travel costs.</p>\n<p>“Everything comes out of our own pockets including airfare … this is a complete volunteer trip,” Cardenas said. “It’s not just a group of kids going on a vacation … It’s a group of kids going to help people [and] to make lives better.”</p>\n<p>The 10-day trip includes medication distribution, patient consultation, door-to-door greetings and a public health day educating local communities about water filtration systems and the importance of sanitation.</p>\n<p>GMB Vice President of Fundraising Steven Tilem, a fourth-year microbiology major, said the local chapter is being given the honor of representing the U.S. as one of the first groups involved in the new Ghana program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is one of the lucky few United States programs that has the opportunity to be a foundation for this new community,” Tilem said. “It is a great opportunity, and it is all based on the fact that we have a great reputation not only with excellent funding and support from our school and community, but because of the dedication of students and UCSB in general.”</p>\n<p>GMB President Jamie Miller, a fourth-year biology major, said the club ultimately seeks to better the living standards in the Ghanaian communities.</p>\n<p>“Our primary goal is to go to these communities that do not have adequate access to health care,” Miller said. “In Ghana, we will organize medications to distribute and go door-to-door to identify problems so that we can [ultimately] prevent them.”</p>\n<p>The board fully funded the group in the amount of $4,625 with the stipulation that it host an A.S. awareness event.</p>\n<p>According to Cardenas, all students can apply to participate in UCSB’s Global Medical Brigades. Last fall, 40 students were selected to go on the Ghana trip.</p>\n<p>In addition, 15 local healthcare professionals traveled to Ghana, including UCSB faculty member and alumnus Dr. Jason Prystowsky.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/","id":3101,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3100,3099,3098],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Election Bill Veto Sparks Controversy in A.S.

President Harrison Weber’s veto of the organization’s amended Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Weber struck the bill down after the representatives unanimously voted in its favor last week on the grounds that many of its provisions — such as a ban on A.S. officials’ candidate endorsements — violated First Amendment rights. The committee modifies the code every year to ensure fair and equitable campaigning for students interested in running in elections during Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Weber, campus legal counsel Nancy G. Hamill also flagged certain legal ramifications in the new Elections Code that could potentially face legal challenge if the veto is overridden.</p>\n<p>“I did not want to do a veto, [and] I believe a veto should not be thrown around like it’s not a big deal,” Weber said. “But things like the Elections Committee exist for a reason — and the veto exists for a reason, and I felt there were some things that really needed to be addressed.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Elections Committee Chair Courtney Axner said the council supports an override of the veto without further alterations by a two-thirds vote of the council.</p>\n<p>“We support him fully, and I think he is a great President, [but] in all honesty we’re just … trying to work the process out,” Axner said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ban unnecessarily prevents officials from favoring candidates, Weber said.</p>\n<p>“The endorsement question does not have any legitimate educational purpose because students are only told what certain officials think of candidates,” Weber said. “Student-Advocate General endorsements are only as good as the credibility behind the endorsement. It is not just like a rubber stamp that says: you got my endorsement, you got the position.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, the endorsements help prevent the election of “an outside person without any regulation [who] can do damage to the office and the services it provides.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Marlene Moreno said biased endorsements may sway voters and create an unequal arena for candidates without connections in the association.</p>\n<p>“[The] Student Advocate General should not be able to endorse views because [Weber] has a very idealistic view that a hundred percent of the students will know what a Student General does,” Moreno said. “I have faith in students but people will take titles at face value.”</p>\n<p>Weber also requested the committee clarify its ambiguous definition of “defamation” and what constitutes “offensive or inappropriate” language as well as re-evaluate its restriction of the campaigning period to two weeks due to its possible limitation on free speech.</p>\n<p>However, Axner said candidates’ unique position as students and politicians requires extra consideration.</p>\n<p>“Nationally, presidents can campaign whenever they want, but our concern is that we are students first before we are any elected position,” Axner said. “By [establishing a] limited two-week period of campaigning, it gives students ample time to say ‘I’m a student first, and then the two weeks I’m going to work really hard for the position I want.’”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nate Walker said the Council should take Weber’s recommendations into consideration to avoid placing itself in a legal dispute.</p>\n<p>“I trust that if we make rational amendments to the bill that are in the interest in the students, Harrison will not veto it again,” Walker said. “We let the veto go through, we put this in old-business, we make all amendments and add in the Elections Code verbiage.”</p>\n<p>The issue remained unresolved as of press time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44716\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44716\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/","id":3099,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3098,3097,3096],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Conflict Arises Over Denial of A.S.

Several students approached the podium during the public forum and argued that the council ignored the student body’s interests.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one speaker placed responsibility for the council’s decision on Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker due to her tie-breaking vote. Although Stryker said she supports the SOCC, she does not believe A.S.’s special projects budget should finance the conference.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she offered to dedicate $600 from her office’s funds toward the conference but did not receive a request from the group until Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter said the council’s debate focused on the appropriateness of using the special projects budget rather than the SOCC’s goals.</p>\n<p>Walter asked student attendees for input to help prove the council’s support after hearing numerous speakers.</p>\n<p>“Would you like it if we make a public statement of support, perhaps published in the Nexus — hopefully, if the Nexus will run it — would that make be a sufficient show of support?” Walter said.</p>\n<p>However, SOCC speakers said a public statement would only serve as an appeasement.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Sophia Armen, who chose to address the council as a student body member, said the student government’s endorsement for such events is vital for the campus community.</p>\n<p>“Support folks that do good shit! Students of color are disproportionately marginalized [and] they have to go through so much every day,” Armen said. “Being in this room, sitting at this table is a privilege. You are no longer acting for yourself; you are acting in consideration of other people … The climate of this room is not progressing us towards making this a more inclusive association.”</p>\n<p>In light of the council’s $145 Oct. 27 allocation toward the Campus Democrats, A.S. President Harrison Weber said the issue provokes a larger discussion on the council budget’s intended use.</p>\n<p>“The council needs to define what [its] special projects [budget] is for,” Weber said. “It sends a mixed message that the role of special projects isn’t to fund groups, but another group was funded. Also, I think it speaks to the larger issue: we need to have more discussion outside of this council.”</p>\n<p>The council had yet to discuss the bills and resolutions on last night’s agenda including legislation to restructure the External Vice President of Local Affairs, IVP and CAB Foundation offices as of press time.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/","id":3097,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3096,3095,3094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Executive Director Marisela Marquez rejected the question on the grounds that it was too specific for Wednesday night’s public Legislative Council meeting, prompting Bishop to clarify that her query described a hypothetical scenario involving any chair of any committee.</p>\n<p>Seemingly satisfied, Marquez explained how and why she utilizes preemptive action to follow through on impulses of keen perception and dispel the dangers of the unknown.</p>\n<p>“If you’re talking about, say, the Internal Vice President, it doesn’t have a vote but there is a great deal of pressure that could be brought on them, potentially,” Marquez said. “At the very least, there’s a perception of a conflict of interest; that’s the issue we’re charged with making sure doesn’t happen. If these are potentially two trains that are going to cross and derail, then why wait until it gets derailed?”</p>\n<p>Under the direction of Marquez, A.S. Associate Director for Special Projects Denise Rinaldi threatened to exercise the permanent staff’s power to terminate student employees in an ultimatum offered to former Judicial Council chair Jeanne Sabin. Given the choice to keep either her job as Legislative Council’s minute-taker — a title she’s held for three years that provides a consistent, hourly income — or her newly-appointed position as the non-voting chair of Judicial Council, Sabin tearfully resigned from the latter on Sept. 28.</p>\n<p>Sabin declined to comment, saying she feared repercussions from the permanent staff.</p>\n<p>Many members of the council, including Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, spoke out against Marquez’s claim that holding the two positions at once could present a plausible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>“Because she’s the minute-taker of Legislative Council and she doesn’t hold an elected position … All she does is listen to what’s said and write it down,” Stryker said. “Students from both parties were really outraged.”</p>\n<p>A council member brought the issue of inconsistent policy enforcement to the meeting’s forefront when he attempted to explain how he knows other students who hold similar dual positions within A.S., but was interrupted when Stryker requested that he “try not to be specific, please.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Representative Kristian Whittaker, Marquez spoke to council members at Legislative Council’s retreat last weekend and encouraged them to consider holding closed meetings and speaking cryptically during open meetings to avoid controversy. While Article VI, Section 1 allows Legislative Council to hold closed meetings with the approval of two-thirds of the members, Whittaker said Marquez’s recommendations extended beyond conducting private business behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>“Well, what we would do is we would ask for the person [at the podium] to present an example that would be similar to the situation, but not so much exactly the situation,” Whittaker[[ok]] said.</p>\n<p>In spite of her own recommendations, Marquez allowed the violation of mandated vagueness and asked a favor of the council.</p>\n<p>“Staff would prefer not to do those dual appointments, so if you have those folks that you want to point out to me, that would be helpful,” Marquez said in complete seriousness as many council members and attendees failed to stifle their laughter.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jonathan Abboud said whether or not the contentious policy is permitted, allegations of a conflict of interest simply do not make sense in Sabin’s case.</p>\n<p>“Jeanne is the most unbiased person in A.S.,” Abboud said. “I don’t think she would be biased at all, and that’s why I was so opposed to her being put in that position. … We were all really confused, like, ‘Did this just happen? Seriously?’”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Article VI, Section 2 of the Legal Code recognizes the A.S. President’s clear authority over the Executive Director, stating that “The President shall: 1) Be the Chief Executive Officer of the Associated Students and shall coordinate and be responsible for the functioning of the A.S. Executive Director.”</p>\n<p>Abboud cited Sabin’s excellent record with Presidents past and current as another compelling and legally verified reason to allow her to serve in both roles.</p>\n<p>“[Jeanne] has seen three different Legislative Councils, three different Presidents and she’s taken the minutes consistently,” Abboud said. “She really wanted to get involved in A.S. as an appointed member and that’s when she went to Judicial Council because that’s what she thought she’d be good at, and two different Presidents thought she would be good at that job — Harrison and Paul.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President J.P. Primeau, who served during the 2008-09 school year, said he often clashed with permanent staff members in a continuous struggle for authority.</p>\n<p>“One of my key goals as President was to change the relationship between students and administrators,” Primeau wrote in the A.S. 08-09 Annual Report. “I had always felt that, despite our tremendous ability to organize and advocate, we reacted to university policy after it had been established (Minimum Cumulative Progress being the prime example). To change that policy students would need to take a more proactive approach based on shared governance — simply put, more students needed to be at the table when big decisions were made.”</p>\n<p>Third Supervisorial District Representative for Santa Barbara County Democratic Central Committee and Mixed Student Union Co-Chair Nicole Leopardo, who ran for External Vice President of Local Affairs with the Democratic Process Party last Spring, said the staff’s hard work often goes unappreciated but has also threatened the autonomy of various groups and members within the organization.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I want the permanent staff to step in and make decisions because I feel like they might be the most logical people in some situations, but other times, like with this situation, [students] should be able to make their decisions,” Leopardo said. “Harrison should be able to make his appointments. That’s not saying we can’t be critical of him, but I just don’t know how I feel about permanent staff kind of stomping on his decisions.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Leopardo said she’s shocked by the permanent staff’s lack of legislative authorization for their interference in students’ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one to check them,” Leopardo said. “There’s no one to say, ‘Hey, you’re not doing your job,’ and that’s what we as students should be doing. There is no democratic process; there are no checks and balances. Right now, it’s a difficult situation.”</p>\n<p>Sabin’s removal leaves the council below quorum with only two remaining members. As such, it cannot function as a judiciary body nor can it move forward with proceedings on currently unresolved cases, such as one from last Spring involving several members of Open People’s Party.</p>\n<p>As a result of unsubstantiated allegations, four elected Legislative Council members were removed from their positions and replaced by the four closest runners-up despite the fact that Judicial Council has yet to reach a ruling. The council is currently seeking applicants and was expected to resolve the case this quarter after accepting the accused party’s petition for a hearing in late May.</p>\n<p>Stryker said any students with concerns can contact the Attorney General or submit a petition or file a case with Judicial Council, which will be reviewed as soon as the entity reaches its quorum of three members.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Abboud said he will be working with the ad hoc committee to put measures in place to protect student employee rights.</p>\n<p>“My personal goal would be to codify exactly what rights A.S. [student] employees have,” Abboud said. “Do they or do they not have the right to be appointed members of A.S.? Personally, I would want them to have that right; probably everyone on Legislative Council does, but I’m not going to speak for them — I can’t — but it seems that she should be able to participate in A.S. and take our minutes.”</p>\n<p>Stryker said while maintaining a working balance between the staff and the students can be taxing, a unified Legislative Council can reinstate its ultimate authority by ballot, if needed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really tough relationship between the staff end of A.S. and the Legal Code part of A.S. because there’s nothing really in the Legal Code that gives any protection over the students when it comes to what happens if admin disagrees, except for the Executive Director — she can be voted out by three-fourths of Legislative Council.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The first installment of this article can be found at the following location: http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/director-intrudes-student-rights/</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/","id":3126,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3125,3124,3123],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Elections Committee’s allegations that members of the party furnished alcohol to minors during Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>Four unelected Democratic Process Party candidates were sworn in at last Wednesday’s Legislative Council meeting to replace four elected Open People’s Party representatives, who were given the option to either resign or be disqualified from the 2011-2012 council. Four current council members, OPP off-campus representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and OPP Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter have been given the ultimatum to either resign from office or serve their terms without honoraria.</p>\n<p>Despite reports from other campus publications, the individuals have not been charged with soliciting votes in exchange for alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to OPP member and A.S. President Harrison Weber, A.S. Judicial Council can either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or take the case to a trial. Unless Judicial Council agrees to take the case, Weber said its specifics must remain confidential.</p>\n<p>“Technically, according to the process, this is not public until Judicial Council decides to hear the case,” Weber said. “Whether or not I agree with the process, I have to defer to the wisdom of students past who constructed these policies.”</p>\n<p>During public forum at yesterday’s legislative council meeting, third-year environmental studies major Marjan Riazi called for the four remaining accused council members to step down and demanded that A.S. Elections Committee minutes be made public. The committee did not respond to the incident harshly enough, Riazi said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an issue that any of the people that were charged were sworn in because it perpetuates a system that undermines democracy,” Riazi said. “Executives are in charge of the party and should be held more accountable for the party’s actions.”</p>\n<p>Riazi said executive officers who ran as OPP candidates should be held accountable for the accusations regardless.</p>\n<p>“I know that you know exactly what’s going on in your party and if you’re going to run the school, you better know what’s going on in your party,” Riazi said. “I want those people to be held accountable and if any of those executive officers were involved, they should step down or be disqualified.”</p>\n<p>However, Weber said he had no knowledge of the alleged actions until after the complaint was filed and cannot answer for the actions of an entire party.</p>\n<p>“To my knowledge, executives cannot physically be everywhere at one time,” Weber said. “At the end of the day, people are adults and they make their own decisions.”</p>\n<p>Former DPP Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said allowing the four accused representatives to remain on the council without receiving honoraria is not an appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is what keeps [council members] accountable,” Mayville said. “If you don’t get honoraria, it’s hard to stay accountable because there is less of a sense of motivation. Where does the incentive come from?”</p>\n<p>Vice-Chair of Committee on Committees Kellie Hartl said Elections Committee told her she would have to serve six hours of community service or be forced to resign. However, Hartl said she was not directly involved in OPP campaigning since she holds an appointed, not elected, position.</p>\n<p>“The claims that are being made against me are unfair,” Hartl said. “I’ve never run for office; I’m in an appointed position.”</p>\n<p>Elections Committee charged Hartl with involvement in the incident through her supposed status as a party liaison to OPP. According to the Article 14 of the A.S. Legal Code, party liaisons are individuals involved with the party who may or may not be candidates. The code requires that these individuals sign a promissory note agreeing that they will not violate A.S. Legal Code or local, state or federal law — a form Hartl said she never signed.</p>\n<p>Disqualified OPP Representative-at-Large Kelly Gandee, who garnered the fourth most votes of any 2011-2012 Legislative Council representative, said the Elections Committee has handled the investigation poorly.</p>\n<p>“I would like to have seen a more organized form of questioning,” Gandee said. “I felt attacked during the sentencing meeting and I felt like I was being pressured to resign without factual evidence.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Dariush Banihashemi said during last night’s Legislative council meeting that it is important for A.S. members to act as role models for other students and silence student publications.</p>\n<p>“There are many things that haven’t been brought up and this is a bad road to go down,” Banihashemi said. “A.S. council members, it is your duty to set an example around campus and to not give quotes to the Nexus.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/","id":3120,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3119,3118,3117],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Representatives</strong></p>\n<p>Six unelected representatives were sworn in to the 2011-2012 Associated Students Legislative Council at last night’s meeting to replace four newly elected representatives involved in an ongoing judicial council case in addition to two representative-elects who have officially resigned.</p>\n<p>After pleading no contest to charges of grand theft, unauthorized alteration of a computer data system, felony burglary and receiving stolen property at his preliminary hearing yesterday, Representative-at-Large-elect Joe Lee formally stepped down from his position, citing “idiotic political pressure … roaming around A.S.” Lee, who was replaced by Democratic Process Party representative-at-large Sophia Armen, went on to accuse an unnamed fellow council member of extortion during the meeting’s public forum. Lee is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing on June 22.</p>\n<p>In addition, Open People’s Party On-Campus Representative-elect Pancho Occiano chose to defer his position on next year’s council to D.P.P. On-Campus Representative Christian Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Four elected O.P.P. members — Representatives-at-Large Kelly Gandee and Chelsea Parrott and Off-Campus Representatives Lauren Begleiter and Alexa Cover — were charged with supplying alcohol to minors during Spring Elections by A.S. Elections Committee on May 6 and face either disqualification or forced resignation pending Judicial Council’s approval of the case. The four were replaced by D.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Xenia Mendez and Marlene Moreno and D.P.P. Representatives-at-Large Danielle Stevens and Danielle Bermudez.</p>\n<p>Four additional council members — O.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and O.P.P. Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter — were charged with the same infraction but given the option to either resign or serve their terms without receiving honoraria. All four were sworn in last night and plan to remain on the council. Former Legislative Council members Yeni Nguyen and Kellie Hartl were also implicated in the case but may not fall under the purview of Elections Committee as they are no longer student government representatives. O.P.P. Executive Board members President Harrison Weber, Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, External Vice President of Local Affairs Tim Benson and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Ahmed Mostafa were also charged and given the option to either resign or serve as planned and complete 45 hours of A.S.-related community service each during the 2011-2012 academic year. All four plan to remain in their newly appointed positions.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is slated to inform the individuals today of its decision to either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or hear an appeal drafted by the Executive board members on behalf of all 14 implicated students.</p>\n<p>According to Benson, Elections Committee — which holds closed meetings only — reached their decision in a manner not consistent with A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely taking [the case] to Judicial Council because we feel that, based on the Legal Code and based on the rules that are in place for the elections committee, they followed them improperly and we were unjustly given pretty harsh punishments,” Benson said. “They never gave me any due process in any of this. I felt that it wasn’t really fair that I was given no chance to explain myself, no chance to explain any of my involvement in what was going on and I was given quite a hefty slap on the wrist.”</p>\n<p>Visit dailynexus.com for online updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Business</strong></p>\n<p>In their final meeting, the 2010-2011 council approved a reallocation of $700 for a planned UC Haiti Initiative and set aside $55,000 — comprised of funding from the budgets of various BCCs — to fund the A.S. Annex, an Isla Vista community center that provide offices for A.S. entities, in the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis said while he supported the allocation, he is concerned the center’s location is not accessible to students in the community.</p>\n<p>“I think this is a great bill but I drove by and checked out the building, and it seems a bit hidden,” Lewis said. “I’d eventually like to have a sign or notice on that street to attract some attention since I don’t think it’ll get a lot of foot traffic on its own.”</p>\n<p>Former Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said the resolution provides that there will be such signs in the surrounding area of the center.</p>\n<p>The council reallocated $200 instead of an originally requested $467 for Black Graduation to print graduation programs. Lewis said the funding did not seem necessary as it would benefit only a select number of students.</p>\n<p>“I just don’t feel it represents the entire student body as student funds should,” Lewis said. “I feel it’s exclusive to the rest of the student body.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville authored a Green Bill mandating sustainable practices within A.S. buildings, including recycling, composting, avoiding paper and using green cleaning products. The bill was amended to include a mandate that A.S. funds given for group events or meetings may only purchase food that is at least 50 percent sustainable.</p>\n<p>While Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said the request would be unrealistic for student groups and drive up event costs, Mayville said the bill is intended to set a precedent for the rest of the student body.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize it is expensive, but I think a little less food or more costly food is worth it because it is socially and environmentally responsible, and A.S. needs to set an example,” Mayville said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker said the bill’s specificity would make it difficult to enforce.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a Finance board perspective, another really tough thing will be how to let groups know about all this,” Stryker said. “It’s going to be hard for groups to follow all of this. Make it more broad so student groups can feasibly follow and understand it.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the council has the duty to implement progressive policies and student groups have been asked to follow similar rules in the past.</p>\n<p>“[Office of Student Life] groups learn so quickly about what our funding policies are,” Tzankov said. “I think it’s important that we do set the precedent and we don’t put this off, but approve it as it is.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually passed the bill with an amendment making it applicable to only A.S. entities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated over a bill to increase transparency within the group by posting audio recordings of its weekly meetings on the association’s website. However, the bill failed to pass due to expensive software and microphone costs. Tsankov said he recommended that the newly appointed council continue discussion on the measure.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/","id":3123,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3122,3121,3120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Program Board required attendees to present an ACCESS card to gain entrance, making the event exclusive to the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>The change was met with mixed feelings from students but many agreed that wait times were significantly reduced.</p>\n<p>Yasmin Sharawy, a second-year biology major, said she saw a marked difference in lines between this and last year’s events.</p>\n<p>“Last year it took us two hours to get in,” Sharawy said. “This year it took us two minutes.”</p>\n<p>Second-year linguistics major Dana Fallon said while she was disappointed that visitors were not welcome, the change positively influenced crowd management at the historically hectic happening.</p>\n<p>“My friend from out of town came last year,” Fallon said. “It’s too bad she couldn’t come this year, but it was overall a lot faster and it’s more fun with only UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Local band Sprout, winner of this year’s Battle of the Bands, kicked off the event after gates opened at 1 p.m. Michael Wagman, an undeclared second-year, said the act set a good tone for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>“Sprout was great,” Wagman said. “We got here 15 minutes after it opened and saw the openers. The djembe player was amazing and fine.”</p>\n<p>The next act, Santa Cruz-based ska group The Expendables, received similar praise for their diverse tunes, which incorporated styles spanning from punk rock to reggae. Sharawy said the set proved enjoyable to everyone from diehard fans to first-time listeners.</p>\n<p>“I hadn’t heard of them until now,” Sharawy said. “But they’re really good live.”</p>\n<p>Rapper Talib Kweli took the stage next, performing a diverse selection of tunes with music by other artists such as The Beatles mixed into his own songs. During his set, Kweli reprimanded Fox News for calling rapper Common “vile” and denounced the channel by calling it an entertainment source lacking in real news value.</p>\n<p>English DJ Rusko followed with an hour of dubstep that set off a massive wave of dancing within the crowd but was nonetheless met with mixed reactions. Uce Nnadi, a second-year political science major, said the DJ gave a quality performance.</p>\n<p>“He came and delivered,” Nnadi said. “It was dubstep in its purest.”</p>\n<p>However, third-year mathematics major Eric Frydendal was not as impressed with the artist’s spins.</p>\n<p>“I’m too sober for this shit,” Frydendal said.</p>\n<p>Headliner Cee Lo Green then took the stage, opening with a rendition of Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train.” The Gnarls Barkley singer covered various other rock songs before unveiling his former band’s top single “Crazy” and his own recent chart-topper “Fuck You.” Green closed the set with a rendition of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” to end the festival.</p>\n<p>Sharawy said the artist’s performance was an improvement in entertainment from previous years.</p>\n<p>“He started off slow, but it got really good at the end because we knew the songs,” Sharawy said. “It was way better this year. He was a way better headliner than Drake. He tried to please the crowd while Drake didn’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38843\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38843\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/","id":3137,"author":{"id":214,"name":"Mackensie Minniear"},"related":[3136,3135,3134],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Current Council Convenes for Last Spring Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council instated an expansion of the A.S.

Emergency Loan program during last night’s final meeting before government turnovers.</p>\n<p>The council officially placed the newly created UCSB Community Financial Fund — a student loan program approved as a new fee during this year’s Spring Elections — into the association’s by-laws. Additionally, the council approved a request of $459 to fund a week-long advertisement in the Santa Barbara Independent publicizing the May 26 event “The Alternative: Bringing Power to Our Voices,” which will take place during College Republicans’  David Horowitz lecture.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the event aims to appease students concerned about the controversial message behind Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>“He has decades of experience of twisting your words and forcing you to say something,” Tzankov said. “It’s just not a healthy space for dialogue. We didn’t want to work in his space but created an alternative event where we will have a healthy space for dialogue.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joe Lee, however, said scheduling the speeches at separate times would allow students to attend both lectures and provide more balanced arguments.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be effective if you see the event first and have a reactive event to that,” Lee said. “We don’t know what’s going to be happening there. Maybe if you have it before or after, students who are attending David Horowitz will have an opportunity to attend this event.”</p>\n<p>Despite Lee’s suggestion the forum was not rescheduled and is slated to take place during Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>The council also discussed a Bill to Restructure Queer Commission that proposed additional unfunded positions on the committee to further gender education efforts on campus.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said the legislation would provide vital resources to ensure equality on campus.</p>\n<p>“We created the first Queer Alumni Network, which is a branch of the Alumni Association, specifically for queer alumni,” Del Cid said. “We’re just making sure that’s established and institutionalized within the positions so it can sustain itself. This also creates a position for transfer students as a way for someone who’s new to the community to get involved.”</p>\n<p>However, a significant amount of debate arose over the intricacies of the bill’s language including references to the gender identity “genderfuck.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council tabled the bill until after discussions on old business, leaving the genderfuck issue unresolved.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/","id":3136,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3135,3134,3133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Council Meets Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing funding for College Republicans’ proposal to bring controversial speaker David Horowitz to campus.

Finance Board meeting, College Republicans requested that Legislative Council reopen the board’s minutes and allocate $1,770 for the event’s audio-visual, recording and security costs. Horowitz, a noted conservative activist and writer, last visited campus in April 2008 shortly after accusing UCSB’s Muslim Student Association of having political ties with al-Qaeda. Although several members of the Muslim Student Association and general campus community attended the meeting in protest of the group’s request, the council eventually approved $800 to the organization.</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council remained in session pending the approval of the A.S. 2011-2012 budget, which faces significant cuts.</p>\n<p>President of College Republicans Steven Begakis requested $1,770 for security, audiovisual technology and visual recording for the proposed event. Begakis said the council should allocate funds on the basis of freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>“We just want to bring a conservative speaker to represent our minority opinion and promote a diversity of ideas,” Begakis said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, a second-year political science and feminist studies major, said the board’s eventual decision to even partially fund the event reflected poorly on the student government.</p>\n<p>“Our association does not look good right now in the eyes of the average student,” Armen said. “I just want you to understand … what isolating communities really means. You’d better have communities on this campus’ back, because it’s your job. Not just because it’s your job — because it’s your moral responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Andres Rey, a second-year political science major, said denying funding for the event would be a violation of a citizen’s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>“That’s freedom of speech: the ability for you to speak,” Rey said. “I think it’s a very important step that the council approves the security for funding because you are denying the vehicle for someone to speak.”</p>\n<p>While On-Campus Representative Danielle Stevens objected that Horowitz’s views transcended the divide between free speech and hate speech, Rey said the speaker’s words are not inflammatory enough to be censored by the association.</p>\n<p>“The definition of hate speech … it has to be directly linked to a violent act,” Rey said. “You have to prove it incites direct acts of hatred and I think that’s something you can’t prove.”</p>\n<p>However, College Republicans Vice President Matt Borasi said the campus has the duty of providing students a space where all voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>“Do I agree with everything that Daniel Horowitz said? No,” Borasi said. “What I do agree with is the open forum the university stands for.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association member Ahmed Naguib, however, said the Muslim community is underrepresented on campus and is unwilling to tolerate further discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s 200 or 300 of us on campus. We really fly under the radar,” Naguib said. “But, believe it or not, this is something that really affects us.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board declined to allocate any funds to College Republicans on Monday as, according to A.S. Legal Code, the association cannot deny funding to events on the basis of offensive content.</p>\n<p>“You need to base this not on the context of the event but on the event itself,” Lieberknecht said. “You really need to look at the policies and procedures of what can and can’t be funded.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, California state law requires that the UC Regents not deny funding to events based on their content.</p>\n<p>“If we pass the finance board minutes,” Elwood said, “we will be sued by David Horowitz.”</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2008, the Daily Nexus printed an advertisement paid for by the Horowitz Freedom Center, advocating against the Muslim Students Association and accusing it of being a “Campus Front Group For Jihad.”</p>\n<p>“The MSA is a radical political group that was founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the godfather of al Qaeda and Hamas, to bring the jihad into the heart of American higher education,” the ad read.</p>\n<p>Nick Dürnhöfer, editor in chief of the Nexus in 2008, said the editorial section of the newspaper cannot execute agency over the advertising section.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t see that ad before it ran in the Nexus — I don’t see any ad that goes in there,” Dürnhöfer said. “I’m not going to let a newspaper get biased in that way by picking and choosing advertisers … When you start thinking that way, you can’t really do you job as an editor.”</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the board swiftly approved a motion to allocate $1,100 for the event. However, according to Stryker, confusion arose among the representatives as to what the motion they passed entailed as it followed a string of stipulations and modifications.</p>\n<p>“When the amendment is friendly with the person that made the original motion, then that amendment becomes the new motion,” Stryker said. “So when we passed it, we passed that motion. I guess a few got confused and thought we just passed that motion. People that wanted to vote didn’t understand what was going on and thought it was just to pass that amendment.”</p>\n<p>The result was met with outrage from the audience, as individuals shouted “You are sponsoring Islamophobia and racism on this campus,” and “Who on this board is representing the Muslim community?”</p>\n<p>Considering the murky circumstances under which the resolution had been passed, the council moved to amend the allotted amount to $732, providing funding for only police officers.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee said the council was overstepping in bounds by reopening the discussion.</p>\n<p>“What happened to the whole point of transparency of this council?” Lee said. “We’re already not doing our jobs and paying attention to what’s going on and just because we admitted to making a mistake that doesn’t mean we get to reconsider something we all passed through consent.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually modified the amount to $800.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lee presented an apology for his recent incarceration. He spent five days in Santa Barbara County jail in relation to a stolen laptop and, after pleading not guilty at his arraignment on Tuesday, is set to appear in court on May 18.</p>\n<p>“My mistakes have brought disappointment and frustration to both my student constituents and my peers,” Lee said. “I am ashamed and I fully regret this situation.”</p>\n<p>Lee said he felt the incident was isolated within his personal life and would not affect his ability to perform his job.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do my best to continue to perform to the best of my best in leg council to the students that represented me,” Lee said. “This matter solely matters to me.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/","id":3134,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3133,3132,3131],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":84,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
