We have to celebrate like we own the place — because we do.”</p>\n<p>“We are many, and they are few,” added Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ studies.</p>\n<p>Eric Smith, professor of political science, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday that the national pushback and activism in response to the Trump administration is similar to the state of the nation in the 1960s during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He explained that the U.S. must have a two-party political system in order to maintain balance. He said, however, the polarization between liberal and conservative Americans grew stronger during the presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>Smith noted the way the UCSB campus has experienced its own polarization in the past few years and encouraged the university to host more events that bridge the divide between liberal and conservative students.</p>\n<p>Smith added, however, that there has been destructive actions on both sides. College Republicans’ signs announcing Ben Shapiro were vandalized with spray paint in February.</p>\n<p>“The majority of the campus is liberal on social issues,” Smith said. “Conservatives are feeling attacked and because of that, they’re afraid to speak out in public.”</p>\n<p>In April 2016, controversial pro-Trump graffiti was written in chalk on the ground near the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.</p>\n<p>“If they felt more comfortable speaking up, there would be less of [those] personal attacks,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Klawunn told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that since the election, the university has mobilized efforts to create more spaces for students to discuss controversial issues.</p>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of Young Americans for Liberty began hosting events in the Hub in the UCen to open the dialogue on campus about oftentimes controversial topics. In October, the group organized a debate on free speech in relation to extremist groups.</p>\n<p>The group also organized a discussion on the ethics of abortion on Wednesday, Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the university plans to hold another forum about free speech during Winter Quarter to encourage students on both sides of the issue to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to continue to have different opportunities,” Klawunn said. “Each opportunity can’t do everything but we hope we’ll offer a lot of different perspectives.”</p>\n<p>Vilna Bashi Treitler, professor and chair of the black studies department, said at the forum that she feels “optimistic” about the future because she has seen the way Americans have mobilized in response to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“Oppression and dominance have been with us and may always be with us,” Treitler said. “We get knocked down but we can get back up again.”</p>\n<p>After the forum, the event moved to Storke Plaza, where attendees held blue LED lights and listened to the Chumash Inter-tribal Singers perform songs of survival and resilience.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-professors-community-look-back-on-trumps-first-year-in-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-professors-community-look-back-on-trumps-first-year-in-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-professors-community-look-back-on-trumps-first-year-in-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-professors-community-look-back-on-trumps-first-year-in-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-professors-community-look-back-on-trumps-first-year-in-office/","id":2353,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2352,2351,2350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Hold Vigil for Victims of Sutherland Springs Tragedy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students and faculty sat around a collection of blue mini-LED candles during the vigil.

Executive Director Marisela Márquez gave an opening remark about her personal connection to the tragedy because she previously lived in San Antonio, Texas, an hour away from where the shooting happened.</p>\n<p>“It is odd to see your hometown through the television screen … it doesn’t have to be like this,” Márquez said, referencing the long-debated issue of gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“Many of us, including myself, read headline after headline, and it can feel distant,” said Kristin Hsu, a fourth-year Asian-American studies major and A.S. external vice-president for statewide affairs.</p>\n<p>“Holding a space where people can share their emotions and responses encourages the UCSB community to seek support in times of need and to not be afraid in doing so,” Hsu added.</p>\n<p>Attendees also discussed the wide availability of guns in the United States, the blame on mental illness for shootings and the stricter gun laws in countries such as Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s MultiCultural Center Zaveeni Khan-Marcus also spoke about the prejudice that appears against members of the Muslim community when mass shootings happen in the United States.</p>\n<p>Brandt spoke about the May 23, 2014, shooting in Isla Vista and said it is “easy to feel hopeless” when similar events take place around the country.</p>\n<p>“The collective trauma that links from 2014 is a very real thing and it’s important for people to have a space to process that,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to mourn and heal over innocent lives lost together, especially when our community has been touched by similar tragedy and violence,” Hsu added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79559\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79559\" data-attachment-id=\"79559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/students-hold-vigil-for-victims-of-sutherland-springs-tragedy/community-members-share-their-experience-at-the-vigil-for-texas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Community members share their experience at the Vigil for Texas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79559\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaders of the Isla Vista Community Service District Spencer Brandt (center) and Jonathan Abboud joined the vigil. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vigil attendees also discussed the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 that killed 58 people. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-03/isla-vistans-share-fears-frustrations-after-mass-shooting-in-las-vegas/\">Students hosted a vigil for the shooting on Oct. 3</a> in the I.V.

Users also have the option to attach a large umbrella to the back of the chair.</p>\n<p>Beachgoers can access the chair free of charge at the Adventure Program’s Campus Point Rentals center or through the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>Cathy Czuleger, senior associate director for programming, information technology and development for the Department of Recreation, said the Rec Cen first purchased the beach wheelchair with funding from the Adapted Recreation Program 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The Adapted Recreation Program is a Santa Barbara organization that provides outdoor services to community members with special needs.</p>\n<p>She said when the program ended, the wheelchair became “rusty and unusable” so the Rec Cen contacted CF to fund a new chair.</p>\n<p>The Rec Cen proposed the project to CF and applied for funding during winter 2016, said Peter Min, outreach coordinator for CF.</p>\n<p>“The program ended, and the wheelchair was not maintained or easily available for use during the past 10 years,” Min said.</p>\n<p>Czuleger said she decided to write a proposal to CF requesting money to purchase a new chair and said she was happy with the organization’s “generous” funding allocation.</p>\n<p>According to Min, CF accepts proposals for research, projects and internships every quarter and critically reviews them to see if they are compatible with the organization’s mission statement, the student community and their goal to preserve the shoreline and marine life.</p>\n<p>CF receives funds from all UCSB students through a lock-in student fee every quarter. Each undergraduate student contributes $5.75 per quarter and each graduate student contributes $3.00 per quarter.</p>\n<p>CF provides over $350,000 each year to preserve UCSB’s beaches and has distributed over $3 million locally since the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p>If students wish to earn funding for their own group or organization, they can participate in CF’s restoration projects and beach clean-ups.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements began running on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandora, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram on Oct. 10 and will remain on the sites until Oct. 31. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the advertisements are funded through unrestricted gift funds, which are donations from alumni. The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div

historically large out-of-towner presence in I.V. for party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p><strong>ISLA VISTA</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students’ (A.S.) Halloween website, street parking will be prohibited starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 27, until 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Del Playa Drive, the 6500 block of Trigo Road and between Del Playa Drive and Trigo Road on Camino Pescadero, Camino Del Sur and El Embarcadero Road.</p>\n<p>Cars parked on the 6500 block of El Nido Road and on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road do not need to be moved over this time period, but roadblocks will be placed on those blocks to prevent cars from entering and exiting.</p>\n<p><strong>UCSB</strong></p>\n<p>According to the A.S. Halloween website, visitors are not allowed to park on campus.</p>\n<p>Vehicles parked on campus without a matching permit are subject to a $300 citation and towing.</p>\n<p>Students with a Night &amp; Weekend (N&amp;W) Parking Permit will be able to park on campus from 11 a.m. on Friday to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Lots 22, 18, 16, 30 and 38 will be the only lots open for parking over the weekend.</p>\n<p>N&amp;W permits purchased in the fall cost $52.50 plus a $5.95 shipping charge. Permits are sold year round, but students had to apply for a parking permit by Oct. 15 to have it shipped in time for the coming weekend. Each student may only purchase one permit.</p>\n<p>The only valid permits for overnight parking — between 5 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. — are special event permits, N&amp;W, Isla Vista Access permit for Lot 22 (IVA 22) or faculty and staff permits.</p>\n<p>IVA 22 is a valid permit for Lot 22.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of these permits were available for “community members, UCSB staff, faculty, and non-resident students,” according to the Associated Students’ Halloween tip website.</p>\n<p>Last year, Transportation &amp; Parking Services offered a 50 percent discount for the N&amp;W permits prior to the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nestor Covarrubias, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services, said they decided not to renew the discount this year because they believe the permit price is already fair.</p>\n<p>“The Night and Weekend parking permit is a good value, allowing access to campus for the entire academic year,” Covarrubias said in an email. “The equivalent cost to purchase daily passes for the Halloween period alone would come out to $32.”</p>\n<p>Transportation &amp; Parking Services has sold 354 N&amp;W permits this year. The department sold 465 permits by this time last year, Covarrubias said.</p>\n<p>According to Covarrubias, Transportation &amp; Parking Services issued 95 parking citations between Oct. 28 and Oct. 30 last year. He said 94 of the citations were issued at $48, and one was issued at $238 because the vehicle was parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>GOLETA</strong></p>\n<p>According to Valerie Kushnerov, community relations manager for the City of Goleta, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Friday through Sunday, street parking will be limited to residents with parking permits for the weekend. Two such parking permits were sent to each Goleta household in preparation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

What the hell are we doing?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden was the vice president under the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2017 and has played a vocal role opposing the Trump Administration since his departure from office.</p>\n<p>Biden encouraged students to remain hopeful about politics, even if they believe the current national climate is broken “beyond repair.”</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m so excited about the millennials is because you reached the same place my generation did in the mid-sixties,” he said. “There’s no damn reason your generation can’t [face what’s ahead].”</p>\n<p>The United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War and the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1960’s provoked protests and riots throughout the nation and on college campuses, including student anti-war protests at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Biden spoke passionately about the recent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and reminded the crowd that Americans must bring moral values back into the political system and reject the “phony nationalism” of white supremacists.</p>\n<p>He also criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the protests in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p>“The silence was deafening. Silence is complicity,” he said. “[Silence] emboldens the small number of sick people that are out there.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79251\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79251\" data-attachment-id=\"79251\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-24/biden-expresses-hope-for-the-future-through-students/al_joebiden-171021-dustinharris-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79251\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Biden began his night in front of a sold-out crowd at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani joined Biden onstage for the Q&amp;A portion at the end of the lecture. Biden and Bhavnani discussed gun control, race relations in the U.S. and Biden’s son Beau’s battle with brain cancer.</p>\n<p>Though he often became visibly uncomfortable and withdrawn, Biden spoke with eloquence of his great personal tragedies.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">“No es fácil andar en la calle [It’s not easy being on the streets],” says Hijinio Camacho.<em> Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Since the first week of classes, however, the university has prohibited Camacho and other off-campus vendors from selling on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), the vendors’ sales violate the Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding food vendors unaffiliated with the university. OSL is only allowed to grant permits to campus organizations, not the companies and vendors who work with them.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, off-campus vendors have been allowed to sell products alongside student organizations with permits granted by OSL.</p>\n<p>According to Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, the office wasn’t fully aware the vendors were violating university policies until a meeting on Sept. 25 with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada.”</p>\n<p>— Hijinio Camacho</p></blockquote>\n<p>Camacho said he was notified about the policy reinforcements two days before school started. He then met with OSL on the first day of school to understand why he was no longer permitted to work with student organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>His first event of the school year was a fundraiser with the UCSB Promise Scholars.</p>\n<p>Camacho had planned events with Seoul’d Out, Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), <em>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion, y Revolucion</em>, (M.U.J.E.R.) and the Latino Business Association. He started working with student organizations about two years ago and has held fundraisers with groups such as <em>Hermanas Unidas</em>, <em>Raices de Mi Tierra</em>, Alpha Phi Omega and Lambda Theta Alpha.</p>\n<p>Every school day of this year was booked for an event, Camacho said. Student organizations would typically keep 15 percent of the profit from the shared fundraisers.</p>\n<p>OSL, UCSB Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety are currently creating “more inclusive policies” that will lift the current restrictions surrounding off-campus vendors and allow vendors like Camacho to continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p>“We really want to figure out how to add [off-campus vendor permits] to the sorts of permits we are able to approve…both because it’s a good fundraising mechanism for them but also it has been a positive contribution to our campus,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Tuesday and told the <em>Nexus</em> he now needs two more permits from the university to work with student organizations. The two permits will allow him to sell on campus either once a week or once a month.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said the sudden policy revision further contributed to the frustration and confusion felt by both the students and the vendors because some vendors, like Camacho, already had events planned with student groups.</p>\n<p>“I have been been really clear with every conversation with my colleagues on how important it is that we figure this out, that we figure it out quickly, but also give good and clear advice,” Ashlock said. “That’s why it’s taking a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Camacho, who hails from Puebla, Mexico, has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. He spent time in I.V. during the early years of his time in the U.S. but found little success due to the demographic at the time.</p>\n<p>“When I arrived [in I.V.]… two years after arriving to this country, at that time there was mainly Asians and white people. It was 10 percent Latino,” Camacho said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79154\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"764019501\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79193\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79154\" data-attachment-id=\"79154\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/img_1111/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elote Hijinio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79154 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camacho has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. <em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Upon his return to Isla Vista two years ago, however, Camacho noticed more students of Latino descent at UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB was categorized as a Hispanic Serving Institute by the Association of Colleges and Universities in 2015 and has a 28 percent Chicano/Latino population, according to the 2016-2017 campus profile published by the Office of Budget and Planning.</p>\n<p>The rise in street food popularity over the years has opened the gates to members outside of the Latino community to indulge in Mexican snacks found on push-carts like Camacho’s.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been looking for you for two years!” exclaimed Jacqueline Liu, a third-year global studies and psychology double major, as she approached Camacho’s cart last week. Liu said she remembers living in a Mexican community as a child and taking money from her mother’s purse so she and her brother could buy snacks from their local elotero.</p>\n<p>With a large and increasing fan club comes busy schedules, as Camacho’s days often begin at 3 a.m. when he needs to pick up merchandise, ending at sundown when his day of selling is over.</p>\n<p>On other days, he arrives in I.V. at around 3 p.m. and begins his route on Picasso Road at Children’s Park, making his way down Embarcadero del Norte and down Pardall Road, with a stop in front of Freebirds along the way. From there he goes to Abrego Road and circles back onto Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Camacho also created a Venmo account two years ago that allowed customers to buy from him without using cash. He has also made a Snapchat account with a Bitmoji character so customers can now locate him when he is in I.V.

all first-years were rerouted beginning Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Courses are still offered for the old program, but students entering the department are pushed towards earning a more biology-based degree.</p>\n<p>Classes in chemistry and biology are now prerequisites for earning a Bachelor of Science degree in psychological and brain sciences, as well as biopsychology.</p>\n<p>The department allowed transfer students to declare the Bachelor of Arts in psychology for a year longer than other students due to the different prerequisites they had to compete at community college.</p>\n<p>UCSB is the first UC campus to only offer the Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>According to the psychology department chair Diane Mackie, modern psychology is more aligned with biology and other science, technology, engineering and math (S.T.E.M.) fields. The changes to the psychology degree are a “reflection” of how the discipline has developed in recent years, she said.</p>\n<p>“The change in degree is meant to benefit students, giving them a competitive edge in their further studies, careers and research,” Mackie said. “We wanted to create a new degree more biologically based and rooted in science.”</p>\n<p>The biology courses offered for the psychology department are different than the courses offered for the biology major, she said.</p>\n<p>Mackie said the old degree did not provide adequate training for modern psychology. The changes were not prompted by financial issues. The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/","id":2744,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[2743,2742,2741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On in I.V.

President Donald Trump announced on Sept. 3 that he intends to promptly repeal the program afterward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though many undocumented students have spoken vehemently against Trump’s repeal, Islas</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually glad the administration is repealing the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The repeal is a “wake-up call” to undocumented youth that DACA was never permanent, said Islas, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year history of public policy major at UCSB</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said students can now begin to address flaws in immigration legislation and focus on the rights of the entire undocumented community, not only students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Other than just fighting for undocumented students, we need to be fighting for all undocumented individuals in this country,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thursday renewal deadline is only for DACA recipients whose applications expire on or before March 5, 2018. The administration may not announce an extended deadline for the undocumented youth whose applications expire after that date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas’s application expires after the March deadline and she said she may not renew her application if an additional renewal date is scheduled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t favor DACA,” she said. “It’s this whole complacency that’s taken part within the community. We just forget about other people’s struggles and other people’s narratives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former President Barack Obama signed DACA into law with an executive order in 2012. Since the program’s introduction, the UC has admitted thousands of recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 800,000 young people in the United States are DACA recipients and approximately 4,000 undocumented students attend a UC campus, according to the UC Office of the President.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said she understood the benefits of DACA when she began school at UC Santa Barbara and was hired for an on-campus job. She said, however, that she still lives in “a constant state of fear” because DACA does not protect all members of her family, including her mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming from someone who has an undocumented mother, I worry more about her than I worried about myself,” Islas said. “DACA never protected my mom and that was my biggest concern.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Tuesday in support of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supervisors Janet Wolf, Joan Hartmann and Das Williams were the resolution’s staunchest supporters; supervisors Steve Lavagnino and Peter Adam, however, abstained from voting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Hartmann said while the resolution was primarily a symbolic gesture, she believes symbols are “vitally important” for local communities to impact the federal government’s policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the resolution was a statement that the County values our Dreamers and we have a welcome sign at the door,” Hartmann said in an email. “They should know that we want to invest in their futures because they are critical to the County’s future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 8 in response to President Trump’s repeal of DACA. Napolitano alleged that the “unlawful” repeal violated the rights of the people that benefit from the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC also allocates $2.5 million per year for undocumented student fellowships under Napolitano’s D.R.E.A.M. loan initiative, and grants the UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Supreme Court recently turned down a case challenging the UC Regents’ decision to allow undocumented students access to financial aid and pay in-state tuition fees in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump has given the DACA repeal to Congress, which can suggest a replacement for DACA in six months before the president officially abolishes the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said while she does not trust Congress, the best form of a new system for the undocumented community would include an updated D.R.E.A.M. Act without the enforcement of border security and detention centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some safety coming from legislation would be abolishing detention centers,” Islas said. “But I don’t believe the liberation of the undocumented community comes from a piece of legislation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure there’s something that’s viable that protects the 11 million [undocumented immigrants],” she added. “It’s not impossible.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/","id":2367,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2366,2365,2364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"$48 Fix: A.S.

According to the $48 Fix report, tuition could be free for university and college students in California with the implementation of a statewide income surtax of $48 per year for the median California taxpayer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the Senate’s approval of the resolution is primarily symbolic, it will prompt action from the executive branches of A.S. to hold campus-based campaigns, UC Student Association and U.S. Student Association meetings, as well as lobby visits with state representatives to gain support for the plan throughout the state.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would like to see people direct their energy and anger to their local legislators,” Woodrow Davidson, EVPSA deputy chief of staff and one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said. “That’s where people need to begin ramping up the pressure. In the end, it has to pass through the state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was the first item on the agenda at the senate’s first meeting of the year and was authored by senators Dhishal Jayasinghe and Andrea Reyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tuition [that is] free is not a ridiculous idea,” Reyes told the <i>Nexus </i>on<i> </i>Tuesday. “It’s something that is possible in our state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reyes is a transfer student and said the cost of a public university was the primary reason she chose to attend a community college before coming to UC Santa Barbara. She said, however, that she believes even the cost of community college can be a financial burden for many students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spencer Brandt, one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said in a changing world and economy, the state must invest in higher education and not only fund K-12 education.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s important to have [senate’s] support to continue the movement for free college in California and gather momentum at the grassroots level,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Davidson told the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday he planned to attend a community college after high school because of its affordability, but his father encouraged him to attend UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He reminded the senate at the meeting that a UC, California State University and community college education was originally free. He said he believes the current political climate of instability presents students with an opportunity to make important changes at the higher levels of government.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is the moment that we seize on,” Davidson said. “This is the moment that we can truly make a better future for not just ourselves but for the people who will be coming here years down the road.”</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The new charging stations, installed in parking lots 58 and 59 for the San Joaquin Apartments and Santa Catalina Residence Halls, are exclusively for UCSB-owned vehicles.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university currently has 28 charging stations for faculty, student and visitor use in parking lots 10, 18, 22 and 60. In addition to the electric chargers, there are 34 stations on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Each two-space charging station costs approximately $10,000, according to James Wagner, program manager for transportation and parking services. The university pays an additional $250 per year for each space in network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university may also install charging stations in parking lot 31 at the end of the calendar year after assessing the total costs of the project.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many university staff and faculty members charge their vehicle while at work if they do not have an electric car charger at home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rates for the charging stations vary depending on their location and power level. Level one is the most basic power level and level two is six times as powerful as the first level, Wagner said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Level one power is $1 for every four hours, with a 12-hour maximum. Level two power costs $1 per hour with a 10-hour maximum in most parking structures. Level two power in Lot 60 costs $0.20 per kilowatt hour.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the university primarily relies on grants to fund the charging stations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Organizations such as the California Department of Energy, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Green Initiatives Fund of UCSB provide the funding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The vehicle charging stations are not a source of revenue for the university, Wagner said, adding that the fee users pay to charge their vehicles is distributed to the stations’ maintenance, payment processing fees and the network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB housing and dining services installed the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Lots 58, 59 and 60.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the charging station installation process does not take longer than a week, especially if the underground wiring is already in place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to data collected by the university’s transportation and parking services department, the use of electric energy has steadily increased since they were first installed in 2012. This year, approximately 125 megawatts hours (MWh) were distributed by the electric vehicle charging stations.</p>\n<p>According to the California New Car Dealers Association’s quarterly report released in May 2017, 4.8 percent of new vehicles registered in California in the first three months of 2017 were zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Correction: </span><span class=\"s1\">The university pays $250 per year in network connection fees, not electric connection fees, as the article previously stated. The article was also corrected to clarify that energy is measured in megawatt hours, not megawatts per hour. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> </span></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/","id":2365,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2364,2363,2362],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":39,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
