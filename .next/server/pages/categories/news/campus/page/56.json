According to the statement, if Wells Fargo fails to do so by the deadline, ABC will continue to pressure the UC to divest its $425 million invested with Wells Fargo. ABC pressured UC to divest from private prisons in December, prompting UC to sell approximately $25 million in private prison shares.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, said black students remain upset that the UC invests in Wells Fargo despite selling its shares in private prison corporations. Mitchell said she believes Wells Fargo contributes to private prison funding.</p>\n<p>“We cannot be complacent with the fact that our tuition is being invested, either indirectly or directly, to the incarceration of our people,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>ABC spokesperson Anthony Williams, citing research conducted by Enlace’s Private Prison Divestment Campaign, said Wells Fargo is financially invested in private prison corporations such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO) in several ways.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, Wells Fargo owns 1.5 million shares in GEO and CCA, acts as an issuing lender on CCA’s $900 million line of credit and serves as bond trustee to GEO’s $300 million corporate debt.</p>\n<p>“They are funding private prisons,” Williams said. “Wells Fargo is completely complicit in private prisons and what they do and how they treat people, which is horrid.”</p>\n<p>According to Wells Fargo spokesperson Ruben Pulido, the bank bears no financial investment in either GEO or CCA. Pulido said Wells Fargo Funds, owned by the funds’ investors and not Wells Fargo, currently holds a small position in the companies through a passive index fund.</p>\n<p>“Wells Fargo holds no investment in either The GEO Group or the Corrections Corporation of America,” Pulido said in an email. “We have no seat on either company’s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Henning Bohn said Wells Fargo provides passive index funds for customers to invest in other companies, which is a product that “any random financial firm” would offer to its customers. Bohn said Wells Fargo customers own the shares in private prison corporations, not Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>“From an economic perspective, I would say [Wells Fargo] doesn’t really hold an economic interest because the interest is held by their customers — those are the beneficiaries,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Bohn said if Wells Fargo were to end all investments in private prison corporations through index funds, the bank would first have to withdraw all index fund products, and would only offer funds investing in companies in which the bank wants clients to invest.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that Wells Fargo is probably not going to do,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said she does not believe the distinction between Well Fargo and Wells Fargo Funds makes a difference.</p>\n<p>“It’s still Wells Fargo,” Mitchell said. “You can separate it however you want bureaucratically, but it is the arm of the same system.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, black student leaders want UC and other “financiers” to divest from for-profit prisons because of how incarceration oppresses black people.</p>\n<p>“Private prisons literally make a profit off of the incarceration of people, who, within a system that’s rooted in white supremacy and capitalism, are for the most part black and brown bodies,” Mitchell said. “Their system of mass incarceration has not helped the black community.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the business model of private prisons requires they lobby for criminal justice and immigration policies to incarcerate as many people as possible. Williams also said these policies generally lead to the disproportionate number of racial minorities in the prison facilities of corporations like GEO and CCA.</p>\n<p>“Their business model is getting as many people incarcerated as possible and having contracts, and if they can’t do that, then how are they going to make money?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to CCA Director of Public Affairs Jonathan Burns, CCA does not take an active stance on public policies affecting incarceration.</p>\n<p>“To be clear, CCA does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Burns said in an email.</p>\n<p>GEO Vice President of Corporate Relations Pablo Paez also said he “vehemently refutes” these charges.</p>\n<p>“The allegation that our company has engaged in lobbying and advocacy for public policies that are detrimental to communities is simply not accurate,” Paez said. “Our company has never taken a position on criminal justice or immigration policies.”</p>\n<p>Paez said GEO helps those who are incarcerated by investing millions of dollars into rehabilitation and re-entry programs for prisoners to transition more smoothly back into society.</p>\n<p>“Groups like this one advance the notion that groups in our industry are somehow unaccountable to the government and to the public,” Paez said. “What we’ve done over the years is counter the rhetoric that is being advanced by groups like that of the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is nothing a private prison corporation like GEO can do to be accountable to the public except to close its doors.</p>\n<p>“For private prison organizations to be accountable to the public, they would have to shut down,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

University of Washington, Seattle to give a lecture titled “Back There We Had Nothing to Eat: Food Insecurity and Women’s Migration at the Intersections.”</p>\n<p>The lecture, which took place Tuesday afternoon at the McCune Conference Center, focused on the conditions displacing many women and families across borders, how hunger and food insecurity relates to the inequality of opportunities across borders and how gender shapes experiences with food insecurity and health vulnerability for migrants in the United States. Carney’s research focuses specifically on the effects of food insecurity on women who migrate to the United States from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>According to Carney, these women experience unique consequences of displacement.</p>\n<p>“Women from these communities have faced a unique set of challenges,” Carney said. “Women’s decision to migrate may exhibit a desire to uphold social obligations in the realm of food.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the globalization of trade and neoliberal policies have caused food insecurity and subsequently displaced many agrarian communities from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>“The North American Free Trade Agreement serves as a prime example of legislation that have displaced many rural Mexican farmers because of their occupation, because they are unable to compete with subsidized produce,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Carney also said food insecurity is a result of structural readjustments to food and trade that come with neoliberal policy.</p>\n<p>“Food insecurity is a palpable consequence of policy shifts and represents the depriving politics of the state,” Carney said. “States often do the depriving intentionally or unintentionally.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Jade Burchett said the lecture explained undocumented migrants’ challenges and motivations and showed that migration is a complex issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67343\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67343\" data-attachment-id=\"67343\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/megan-carney_-by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452615024\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Megan Carney_ by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I liked that the lecture showed the perspective of a group of people who are so stigmatized,” Burchett said. “Often, people belittle migrants by calling them ‘illegal’ and question their motives for crossing the border. This talk showed their motives and how it’s almost necessary for them to migrate.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Jorge Gonzalez said the lecture highlighted the struggle many migrant families face trying to provide nutritious meals during economic hardship.</p>\n<p>“Due to their unauthorized status, they don’t have access to many jobs and often end up working jobs that only give them 20 minutes to an hour to prepare meals,” Gonzalez said. “Because they don’t have time to prepare meals, these families often use prepared food, which has health consequences.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the food financially available to most migrant families is very unhealthy.</p>\n<p>“Many of my key informants perceived the abundance of ‘comida chattara,’ or junk food, in the United States as jeopardizing the efforts of migrants to maintain healthy diets for their family members,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Food Bank and CalFresh Representative Amy Lopez said the Food Bank offers services to the families in Santa Barbara County that face food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank of Santa Barbara County is a nonprofit organization that distributes food to people in need and empowers people with nutrition education,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>To learn more about food insecurity and resources for families in Santa Barbara County, visit Santa Barbara Food Bank’s website at <em><a href=\"http://www.foodbank.sbc.org\">www.foodbank.sbc.org</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/","id":2572,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2571,2570,2569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

preparedness and medical operations throughout January and February.</p>\n<p>The training program will consist of three classes and will train participants to handle real-life disasters, including terrorism and homeland defense. For the course, CERT will work alongside the UCSB American Red Cross Club and Associated Students, which will provide backpacks, flashlights and hardhats for emergency situations. The trainings will be held on Jan. 24 and 31 and Feb. 6 from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the UCSB Environmental and Health Safety Building 565.</p>\n<p>UCSB Emergency Manager Jim Caesar, who is on the State Advisory Board for CERT and organizes CERT trainings, said these classes are important to helping others during a widespread emergency.</p>\n<p>“If we can learn to take care of ourselves, our friends, our neighbors, our family and loved ones, the better off we will be,” Caesar said. “These are important skill sets for our everyday life.”</p>\n<p>Caesar said he is proud of the UCSB program because he believes it is the only university in the nation that offers a training course where students can become certified to teach the course.</p>\n<p>“The CERT class at UCSB is actually taught by students to students,” Caesar said. “[To become a trainer], there is another 20-hour class that they take in order to become certified.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said she took the CERT course her first year at UCSB after becoming certified for lifeguarding and benefitted from the course’s triage training.</p>\n<div

prioritize patients and how to take care of them within a certain time-frame,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Halaweh said after taking the CERT class, she feels more comfortable about potentially handling an emergency because she now knows what to expect.</p>\n<p>“It is really empowering to know that you can help,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major and CERT instructor Amanda McKenna said she became a certified CERT instructor because she is passionate about medical operations and believes the program prepares students for unexpected disasters.</p>\n<p>“I liked the fact that [the course] gets the community together and prepares people for emergency disaster situations that they wouldn’t normally be prepared for,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>McKenna said she will be proud to see students complete a full emergency simulation at the end of the course to demonstrate what they have learned.</p>\n<p>“We have our students use all the skills that they learned, anywhere from carrying people out of structures to triaging,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history and political science double major Duncan Calvert attended the basic CERT course last year and plans to become an instructor.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really important course for building strong community values and making sure your environment and community is safe,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>Calvert said he believes the course gives students the opportunity to learn about the emergency response process and prepare them to assist in disasters.</p>\n<p>“It’s important in helping individuals understand how emergency services work and how they can help out or stay out of harm’s way in the event of a disaster,” Calvert said. “CERT is much more about understanding how emergencies work, and how individuals within the community can help other community members and emergency services do their job.”</p>\n<p>To sign up for the course, students can email Jim Caesar at <em><a

candlelight vigil on Thursday, hosted at the Associated Students Pardall Center by students in association with Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Madison was a lecturer in the Black Studies Department for over 30 years, and passed away on December 29. During his time at UCSB he taught several courses regarding Blacks in sports and media and the Civil Rights Movement, and had a penchant for ruffling feathers with his unapologetic teaching style. Roque-Ramirez was an associate professor of Chican@ studies at UCSB until last year, teaching courses about LGBTQ and Chican@ narratives before passing away on December 25. Roque-Ramirez was born in Santa Ana, Salvador and in 1981 immigrated to the United States to escape the Salvadorian Civil War. He co-founded the Latin American Students Association at UCLA as an undergraduate and is remembered for his passion and resilience in academia.</p>\n<p>Faviana Hirsch-Dubin, former UCSB professor in the Chican@ Studies and education departments, knew both Madison and Roque-Ramirez during her time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“From the very first that I met Professor Roque-Ramirez, we had a magic connection … which I think a lot of people felt with him because he emanated that,” Hirsch-Dubin said. “[Madison] was the voice of reason when it came to race. His understandings were profound and he shared them and inspired many students over so many years.”</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ Studies, said both Madison and Roque-Ramirez were extremely influential during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Horacio was a brilliant man, not only in the regard of being a scholar,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He used to say … ‘I’m a triple threat. I’m gay, I’m Salvadorian and I’m a historian and I’m really gonna … blow boundaries away,’ and that’s what he did. He was able to resonate with many people because he survived so much himself.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Madison played an irreplaceable role in students’ lives, one that was made apparent by how much students cared for him as a professor.</p>\n<p>“They loved him in terms of what he passed on, he spoke truth to power — unflinchingly,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He was just about standing up for life. Otis stood up for justice, for people that were hurting.”</p>\n<p>Sonya Baker, Feminist Studies Business Officer, said Madison and Roque-Ramirez were two “wonderful strong warriors” who influenced UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a teach-in about four years ago … and Otis was in that particular presentation. When he started talking, it was such a relief to hear someone talking without filters or without fear about the problems we face as people of color in this country,” Baker said. “It was fearsome and it was beautiful, and I loved it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67247\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67247\" data-attachment-id=\"67247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/professor-vigil_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452187438\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Professor Vigil\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67247\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=750%2C501\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lola Mondragón, sixth-year graduate student in the Chican@ Studies department, said Roque-Ramirez as an educator and peer had an unspoken understanding of students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“I had gotten out of the military and was a survivor of trauma … we didn’t have a lot of words that we needed to share. He understood that,” Mondragón said. “He validated my experiences that I was having as a graduate student in the academy, a place that is very violent, especially against people of color and queer people like myself. We stand on the shoulders of great people and he will be one of those that I lean on.”</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, fourth-year Black Studies and sociology double major and co-chair of BSU, took <em>BL ST 50:</em> <em>Blacks in the Media</em> her second year and said students who weren’t in Madison’s class would often attend his lectures.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was intimidating to me initially. I can remember my first time entering his classroom and the first words he said to me were, ‘Do you think Barack Obama gives a fuck about you?’ and that was an interlude to his personality,” Harris said. “He was so unapologetic and so comfortable in who he was. He didn’t aim to please anyone … he made sure that black students’ voices were centered in his classroom.”</p>\n<p>Rosie Bermudez, fourth-year Chican@ Studies major, said she applied to the Chican@ Studies major because of Roque-Ramirez and his work recovering the stories of marginalized peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I feel blessed that I was able to talk to him … enjoy his humor, his smile, and even though I only had a brief amount of time to know him, I feel he has truly impacted my life. It is really painful to know that their stories were not shared with more people,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Oral historian at the UC Santa Cruz library Irene Reti first met Roque-Ramirez in Buffalo, New York at an oral history conference in 1998. Reti said Roque-Ramirez quickly became a visionary leader in the Oral History Association, doing “cutting-edge” work on queer oral history.</p>\n<p>“Horacio Roque Ramirez and I were among the first out queer oral historians in the Oral History Association. I had the pleasure of serving with him on the Oral History Executive Council,” Reti said in an email. “He did … inspirational work … especially co-editing <em>Bodies of Evidence: The Practice of Queer Oral History</em> with Nan Boyd. I will miss Horacio and am very sad at his passing.”</p>\n<p>Joanne Yansen Madison, wife of Otis Madison, briefly attended the vigil and was joined by her sister, Madison’s daughter and two sons in thanking attendees for their stories.</p>\n<p>“You know how [Otis] was … he would say, ‘Sure I’m great, I’m the greatest teacher they got!’ but it would always touch him when students would come back and say ‘I took your class and it changed my life,’” Joanne Madison said. “Thank you for standing out here tonight and for honoring your teachers, for learning more about your world and your society and for changing things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/","id":2573,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2572,2571,2570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate appointed two new on-campus senators, first-year students Reilly Hobson and Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Several senators alleged at the meeting that A.S. violated the Legal Code in the process of choosing the candidates. Hobson and Labowe-Stolle will fill two open on-campus positions, one of which was left vacant by second-year art history major Lacy Wright, who resigned in Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Stevan Abdalmalik, a third-year political science major, said A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Kimia Hashemian, a fourth-year sociology major, violated the policy of IVP neutrality because she voted for the selection of the senators.</p>\n<p>“Just like the IVP doesn’t vote in senate, they should not vote in that committee,” Abdalmalik said. “The IVP … should have not voted in that committee, and the vote was cast.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said selection committee leadership supported specific candidates.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me, through the committee’s term, there have been certain biases towards certain candidates by the leadership of the committee, because the violations are factually based and backed by legal code,” Abdalmalik said.</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik also said the committee leaders should not have had access to the names of candidates.</p>\n<p>“The chair and the vice chair were given special privileges of information in knowing the names of the candidates,” Abdalmalik said. “Then they used the names of the candidates, which were barred from all other senate committee members, in order to base their votes.”</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nawar Nemeh, a second-year economics and political science double-major, said the search committee failed to submit a conflict of interest form during the selection process.</p>\n<p>Nemeh referred to <a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/resources/codes-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">Policy 15 of the Legal Code</a>, which says, in part, “all voting members are personally charged with the responsibility of bringing any personal interests said member(s) may have in the outcome(s) of said vote(s).”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said the committee members did not fill out the conflict of interest forms, which outline whether members know any of the candidates, have personal relationships with them, are in any organization with them and if members “would benefit in any way from [the senators] being appointed.”</p>\n<p>“Our committee didn’t fill out this form even though the Legal Code clearly says that we have to fill out this form if we are to appoint a new member,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez said she believes there were no transparency issues in the appointment of the two new senators.</p>\n<p>“If there was a lack of transparency, I would blame [senators] for not going because the meetings were open,” Rodriguez said. “[Senator Nikki Elyasi] was pretty transparent throughout the senate meetings about what we did. I don’t think there was anything wrong with how the process went.”</p>\n<p>The two senators were appointed in a hand vote of 13 for and five against. Four members abstained from the vote. Shortly after the vote, Nemeh and Abdamalik left the meeting early, seemingly in a statement of disapproval.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Off-campus Senator Jerel Constantino, a third-year history of public policy and political science double-major, revealed the “2016 A.S.

The Nexus reccommends wearing proper footwear and leaving extra early for class, amongst other helpful tips. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos. The look on everyone’s face read one word: misery. The bikers were wiping rain (or were they tears?) off their faces; the walkers were trying to keep their umbrellas intact against the ferocious wind. Everyone was asking one big question: “How do I become more waterproof?”</p>\n<p>The answer is in genetics. We are Santa Barbarans and, more importantly, we are Southern Californians. Our people have lived for ages in the land of deserts and droughts, and when the words “El Niño” come up, we start to shake in our flip flops.</p>\n<p>So, here are some rain tips for all you Gauchos as you brave El Niño and any other wet conditions you may endure in your young lives.</p>\n<h4>Stay Dry:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The best shoes for wet weather are any type of rain boot, such as Hunter or L.L. Bean. If you don’t want to spend too much money, an old pair of Converse will get you across campus and back to Isla Vista with minimal damage.</li>\n<li>Waterproof jackets are essential whether you have an umbrella or not. For bikers, if you do not have a bike seat cover, wear a longer jacket to separate you from that wet bike seat after your 10 a.m. lecture.</li>\n<li>Dress in layers. The worst that could happen is being dressed for winter in Seattle and, by midday, it’s summer in San Diego.</li>\n<li>The skies are gray … so wear something colorful! You could brighten your day and even someone else’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Protect Your Home:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your roof for sagging and dark spots. If you see outside light coming in, you might end up with a messy leak all over your living room floor.</li>\n<li>Call your landlord immediately if you see signs of damage so you can fix the problems before the rain continues.</li>\n<li>Grab yourself some buckets. If you have leaks already, put a bucket underneath them to prevent the rain from ruining your floors. When the bucket fills up with water, go find a garden to water.</li>\n<li>Be watchful of erosion on cliffside homes.</li>\n<li>Clean your gutters of leaves and dirt, and make sure there is a clear path for water to flow.</li>\n<li>Cover outdoor furniture to prevent damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bike Safely:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Give yourself extra time before heading to class so you can be cautious of slick bike paths and other bikers.</li>\n<li>Cover your bike seat with a plastic bag. Bring a couple extras with you just in case it rains while you’re in class.</li>\n<li>Be wary of rainbow patches on the bike paths. While they might look pretty, remember that they are built-up oil puddles, and they’re slick.</li>\n<li>Avoid puddles. Save yourself and everyone around you. Please.</li>\n<li>Cherish the knowing glances between you and other bikers as you make that adventure from the 67 block of Trigo to your lecture in the Chem building. You’re all in this together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have Fun:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy popcorn and hot chocolate, and sit down with your favorite Netflix series when it looks too unbearable to venture outside.</li>\n<li>If you can, enjoy it. Jump in puddles, slide through the mud and catch raindrops on your tongue. Who knows when it’ll rain like this again?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

UCSB Library — totaling 150,000 square feet — opened on Monday.</p>\n<p>The “Addition and Renovation Project,” which began in August 2013, made the building more fire and earthquake safe, added computers, created new faculty and graduate student study rooms and increased study space by 20 percent. Students were able to walk through the new paseo entrance Monday and explore 60,000 square feet and three stories of brand new space, which students hope will alleviate library traffic, especially during finals week.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said plans for the renovation had been “in the works for almost two decades,” due partially to rising enrollment.</p>\n<p>“If you have spent any time in the library, you have seen that it’s really packed with students all the time,” Metzger said. “By the time we began [construction], the library hadn’t been touched in 35 years.”</p>\n<p>The project was largely made possible by an approximately $80 million state grant, and Metzger said the library is “continuing to raise money for furnishings, technology, collections and other initiatives.”</p>\n<p>The construction appeared to be ahead of schedule in the summer, and school officials estimated the library would open earlier than expected, but the construction was completed in line with the initial timeframe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67162\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67162\" data-attachment-id=\"67162\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/newlibrary_eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1451912299\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"140\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New Library Opening\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67162\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Metzger said the first few students in the building Monday encountered some surprises, and she warned students to expect some kinks that will be worked out in the coming days.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely some hiccups on opening day morning,” Metzger said. “There were some alarms going off, some doors opening that shouldn’t be opening. People should be a little bit patient with coming back.”</p>\n<p>Students in the library Monday evening said they were enjoying the new library, though, and praised its new design and spaces.</p>\n<p>“I love it. It’s a shocking difference from the old library; the new spaces are so nice,” third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said. “I use the computers in the library all the time, so having all these new options of where to do that is going to be good.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez lives on Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista, which she said has led her to rely on the library for a quiet study space.</p>\n<p>“I can’t study in my apartment,” Hernandez said. “I just will never get homework done there. If I want to get anything done, I’m always at the library.”</p>\n<p>The University of California system plans to enroll 5,000 additional in-state students among its nine campuses next year, and 5,000 more over the subsequent two years. Hernandez said she thought the renovations were necessary to keep up with the new students.</p>\n<p>“Within my last couple of years, I could already tell the library was getting more and more packed every year, so it definitely came at a good time,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Ian Davis works at the circulation desk and said he was enjoying his first shift in the new library.</p>\n<p>“The old space, we worked at circulation over there and it was a lot more cramped,” Davis said. “Here, we obviously have this huge area, which is pretty nice.”</p>\n<p>Davis said he was most excited for the ability to reserve study areas online, “so you don’t have to have someone in your group get there at 8 a.m. and kind of post up. You can do it on your own time which is more convenient for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Chris Claycomb was reading a book in one of the study areas in the new library Monday evening, and said he liked being able to “kill some time” before making the commute home to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Claycomb left UCSB after his sophomore year to study at the United States Naval Academy and is returning this year to complete his degree. He said he remembered a much busier library before the addition.</p>\n<p>“I just remember you would go to the old library and, at least during finals and midterms, you would have to wander three floors to find a room, especially if you were with a group of people,” Claycomb said.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Claycomb said he “only used the library a few times” before the addition, but thought he would “give it a shot” after seeing the addition and renovations.</p>\n<p>There will be a formal opening for the library on Jan. 13, when Chancellor Henry T. Yang will speak and A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal will announce that the senior class gift will be designated for the library, according to Metzger.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

afte...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Former UCSB student Haley Moore filed a Title IX Civil Lawsuit against the Regents of the University of California on Thursday, claiming UCSB failed to adequately address and investigate her case after receiving the complaints in October 2014.</p>\n<p>Moore’s civil action case is based on “Gender Discrimination” under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. According to the plaintiff, she suffered the loss of educational opportunities after being sexually assaulted in October 2014, ultimately being forced to withdraw from the university in January 2015 due to “deliberate indifference” on the part of the university.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore’s cousin reported the sexual assault to the police the morning after the incident. Moore provided a statement to UCPD and went to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) the next day to schedule a counseling session. After Moore received a session with an intern seven to 10 days later, Moore’s father contacted Marisa Huston, Assistant Coordinator of Student Mental Health Services and requested his daughter be able to promptly meet with an experienced counselor. Moore met with Huston two to three days later and was allegedly made to wait 10 minutes and told that Huston was not obligated to the keep the contents of the meeting confidential. During this counseling session, Moore expressed concern about losing her financial aid and student housing if she dropped classes and was told by Huston that these could both be potential problems.</p>\n<p>The case states Kirsten Olson, the Assistant Clinical Director and Administrative Services Coordinator called Moore three to four days after the counseling session and scheduled a meeting for a few days later.</p>\n<p>“At the meeting, Olson immediately began talking to Moore about her grades. She asked Moore if Moore had considered withdrawing from UCSB. Moore informed Olson that she did not want to withdraw. Olson responded by questioning Moore’s decision not to withdraw, and informed Moore that there were counseling measures Moore could engage in during the time she was withdrawn from UCSB,” the case states.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore also had a phone call with Joe O’Brien, Assistant Dean and Director of Advising at UCSB, and was told that if she reduced her course load, she would be ineligible for both financial aid and UCSB housing. Moore also made efforts to switch her counselor at C.A.R.E., but ran into several roadblocks.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Moore received a letter from UCSB informing her of academic probation due to poor academic performance during her first quarter at UCSB. In late January, four months after first reporting her assault to UCSB, Moore withdrew from the university.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that UCSB’s Title IX coordinator was never informed of her sexual assault report and that she was not provided adequate or timely counseling from C.A.R.E. after the sexual assault. Moore’s case also claims UCSB did not take any action to investigate Moore’s report of sexual assault by another UCSB student after she expressed a desire for some “remedial action” to be taken with regard to her report. In response to this request, the university allegedly told Moore an investigation would take a long time, be difficult emotionally and distract Moore from her studies. She was also told a school investigation would likely interfere with, and possibly even sabotage, the criminal investigation of Moore’s assault.</p>\n<p>The case also states Moore encountered the perpetrator of her sexual assault at least one time on campus after the incident, causing Moore to quickly leave the area after suffering a panic attack.</p>\n<p>“The mere presence on campus, without any restrictions, of the student that sexually assaulted Moore made Moore vulnerable to additional harassment and further exposed her to a sexually hostile environment,” the case states.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims she was deprived of several education opportunities, including but not limited to: a drop in her GPA, withdrawal from several classes, avoidance of several social activities on campus, the need to seek multiple accommodations from UCSB and eventual withdrawal from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a result of Defendant Trustees’ deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered loss of educational opportunities and/or benefits, has incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees and costs of litigation,” the case states.</p>\n<p>UCSB and the University of California Office of the President were both unable to comment, stating the case is currently pending litigation.</p>\n<p>UCSB Public Affairs office said while they could not comment on the case, the safety and well-being of students is the university’s highest priority, and students’ cases are treated with care and confidential advocacy.</p>\n<p>“If the student chooses to formally report their assault to the University, the allegations are thoroughly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We strive to ensure that our investigative processes are survivor-centered, but we understand that not every survivor opts to formally report their assault. In all cases we continue to offer support and counseling to assault survivors, as the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

Coalition</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California has sold approximately $25 million worth of indirect investments in private prison corporations after the Afrikan Black Coalition, which encompasses UC’s nine Black Student Unions, revealed in November that the University held shares in private prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) issued <a href=\"http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prison-Divestmen-final-resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a resolution</a> Thursday demanding that UC divest from private prisons and companies that support private prisons. Later on Thursday, a spokesperson from the UC Office of the President (UCOP) confirmed the University’s shares in private prisons, which were part of a broader portfolio, had been sold on Dec. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP’s Director of Media Relations Dianne Klein said after <a href=\"http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/2015/11/30/university-of-california-has-millions-invested-in-private-prisons/\" target=\"_blank\">ABC announced in November that UC had $25 million invested in private prisons</a>, the University decided to sell its shares in the companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students brought this to our attention, and based on that, we looked at our investments in private prisons, which total less than $30 million, and we decided to sell them — they are gone,” Klein said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klein said UC does not issue statements on divestments, but does routinely review its investments, totaling $91 billion, to see if they are financially sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see the issue of private prisons as: Is that really sustainable? Is that going to make us money in the long term? And we don’t think so for these social reasons,” Klein said. “From a risk perspective, it didn’t make sense to hold on to these assets.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB alumnus and Political Director of ABC Yoel Haile said UC’s investments in private prisons supported a system that disproportionately harms poor people and people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The investments were] a practical example of how the UC system doesn’t value black lives or immigrant lives or poor lives because it is underwriting an enterprise that is systematically targeting our people,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said there is a contradiction between UC’s public stance and the corporations in which it is invested financially.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the UC system is the largest public institution in the country and is investing millions of dollars into [private prisons] … the message is obviously that you support this because, even if you say rhetorically that you don’t, your money is speaking,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said ABC members have been speaking with UCOP Chief Investment Officer of the Regents Jagdeep Singh Bachher since August, and are hopeful that his office continues to work with the coalition on its additional demands, which include issuing quarterly investment reports and divesting $425 million from Wells Fargo, which owns shares in private prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Bachher] has stated that he wants to partner with us, and we hope that he becomes a good partner in this matter,” Haile said. “We really hope that the UC does the right thing. And if it doesn’t, then it’s going to have to deal with black students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he was looking forward to discussing the issue more with students in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I appreciate the Afrikan Black Coalition and the Black Student Union bringing up this current issue, and we look forward to having more dialogue and discussion with our ABC and BSU students … at upcoming Regents meetings,” Yang said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major Nia Mitchell said she sees this as one step toward a larger goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting the ball rolling,” Mitchell said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is just the beginning of seeing what black unity and solidarity among people of color can do for the equity of all of our people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.</p>\n<p>California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA), a statewide mental health initiative funded by the 2004 Mental Health Services Act (Prop. 63), implemented new mental health service programs at California’s public colleges in 2010, asking the Santa Monica-based think tank RAND Corporation to conduct an evaluation of the statewide programs over the course of a year. The RAND report indicates the percentage of students accessing mental health treatment increased by about 13 percent from 2013 to 2014. UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) confirms an increase in the number of students it has been treating since receiving CalMHSA funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>RAND Corporation associate policy researcher and lead author of the study J. Scott Ashwood said the increase indicates more students are going to counseling services to receive necessary help.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students at UCs and other systems experience mental health disorders, and it’s also the case that most of those students don’t receive services or treatment for those mental health disorders,” Ashwood said. “We think an increase of 13 percent is a really positive increase because it means that more students are getting treatment for these conditions that they weren’t getting treatment for before.”</p>\n<p>Ashwood said there could be more than one reason campuses treated more students between 2013 and 2014 than in previous years, such as an increase in the amount of insured students due to the Affordable Care Act, but he believes CalMHSA funding for campus mental health services is the primary reason for the increase.</p>\n<p>“We’re pretty confident that some of this increase, at least — and possibly all of it — is due to CalMHSA’s investment,” Ashwood said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. director Jeanne Stanford said UCSB’s mental health services center has seen a 20 percent increase in the amount of students it serves every year since it first received CalMHSA grant funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>“I never knew what money would do for mental health services until we got the grant,” Stanford said. “It made us visible and it made mental health visible. None of that, or maybe a quarter of that, would have been done without the CalMHSA funds.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. mental health specialist Gladys Koscak, who helped decide how to spend CalMHSA grant funding, said C.A.P.S. used the state money mostly for outreach, such as the center’s #SaySomething campaign, which launched in 2012.</p>\n<p>“[The grant] gave us the opportunity to have money for outreach and marketing materials that we typically don’t have money to be able to purchase,” Koscak said. “That really helped spread the word both about our services and also about mental health in general.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychologist Janet Osimo, who also helped allocate CalMHSA grant funds, said the additional money allowed C.A.P.S. to develop a mobile phone app and an online interactive screening program alongside its #SaySomething campaign, which she said encouraged students to access C.A.P.S. over the past few years.</p>\n<p>“I think what the extra funding does for us is it really helps address the unspoken need out there that we’re not aware of so we can start opening our doors more,” Osimo said. “Fortunately, we’ve been able to continue that.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said she hopes the increase in the number of students that C.A.P.S. has treated since 2011 leads university policy makers to give even more funding for campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“I hope it increases the allotment and that it increases what the universities are willing to give to student mental health,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Stanford also said she hopes to see administration designate more campus space to C.A.P.S. to meet the university’s increasing demand for mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just increase the numbers in the schools or build more residence halls without thinking about mental health,” Stanford said. “It’s about finding the space for mental health and wellness services on a campus and making it a policy that every campus has to increase their ability to provide services.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said the RAND Corporation findings will demonstrate to the UC Board of Regents that increased funding toward campus mental health services allows universities to treat more students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the study was a necessary step that a lot of activists were waiting for so that we could prove to the Regents and the policy makers that the funding is really necessary and will be effective,” Zohoori said. “Increased funding will actually benefit students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Sweater Party in the Loma Pelona Center on Monday, encouraging the spirit of the holidays with an ugly sweater contest, cookie decorating, snacks, festive music and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>The Ugly Sweater Party took place after the first day of instruction following Thanksgiving break, and on the official commencement day of “Dead Week.” R.A. of the Zaca house and second-year biochemistry major Mitine and R.A. of the Camuesa house and third-year sociology and psychology double-major Aranki invited students to don holiday attire and relax before finals.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she enjoyed watching friends gather together in Loma Pelona and decorate cookies from an ugly sweater cookie kit.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel like you’re in kindergarten,” Mitine said. “You’re decorating cookies and people are talking and getting to know each other.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said she is excited for Christmas break because she wants to spend time with friends and family and enjoy her first Christmas in Hawaii. Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/","id":2600,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2599,2598,2597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Share Childhood Stories about Santa","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For many of us, the holiday season comes with disappointments in the form of finals, failed classes and freezing temperatures as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

But each year the holiday season brings a much more severe disappointment to children around the world: the realization that Santa Claus isn’t real.</p>\n<p>We all have our own story of discovery, and the <em>Nexus </em>asked five UC Santa Barbara students to share the moment they discovered the magical man was, in fact, a legend.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Sam Lewis said he was sick and home from school one day when his mom sat him down, holding an article about Saint Nicholas to show he was real at some point.</p>\n<p>“Then she said, ‘Even though [Santa Claus] is gone, his spirit still lives on through Christmas, and now you’re part of the knowing club because Santa Claus doesn’t really exist — we’re Santa Claus,’” Lewis said. “‘Your brother isn’t part of the club, so don’t tell him. When he’s about your age, we’ll tell him as well.’ And so for the next couple of years, I was in the know and I thought I was in this cool, exclusive club.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Varshini Satish said she was eager to catch Santa Claus one year with her dad. The two of them camped out by the fireplace on Christmas Eve with baseball bats and a garbage bag to catch Santa.</p>\n<p>“I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually fell asleep,” Satish said. “At some point I woke up when I heard a movement. My dad told me he had gone to get a glass of water, but I saw presents under the tree and I looked at the handwriting on them and it all clicked in my brain.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Camila Holm’s parents were not ready to tell her the truth about Santa Claus when her aunt spoiled the secret one year.</p>\n<p>“My mom always had special wrapping paper and special tags for Santa to use and then when my aunt came to visit, she mixed them up,” Holm said. “So then Santa and my aunt had the same wrapping paper and when I asked my mom about it, I found out.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Travis Kim discovered the sad reality when he supposedly misread the calendar one year.</p>\n<p>“Santa came on [December] 24th . . . I asked my mom why and she said, ‘Everyone makes mistakes — even Santa,’” Kim said. “But Santa never makes mistakes . . . that’s when I knew.”</p>\n<p>For some, like first-year biology major Sunaina Kongara, the illusion of Santa Claus and his reindeer never existed.</p>\n<p>“I never believed in Santa because my dad was too lazy,” Kongara said. “He wouldn’t even wait until we fell asleep to put presents under the tree or eat all the cookies.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 in the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/","id":2602,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2601,2600,2599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Editor in Chief Sends His Wishes This Holiday","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It’s been a tough year.

But that’s exactly the point of terrorism … to make us feel scared. Because, when humans feel scared, it’s a scientifically proven fact that creativity, empathy, generosity, intelligence, performance and pretty much all higher functioning decreases.

But the problem is that we have begun to let that dictate how we feel everything. Everyday function is marred by the possibility of danger, so we keep our heads low and try to make sure we have enough just in case, trusting that everybody else will do the same — it’s not our responsibility how anyone else lives, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. Humans are intrinsically wired for empathy, that’s why we have these things called mirror neurons. If we watch something happen, our brains light up as if it were happening to us. Our nature is to survive, yes, but our nature is also to care.</p>\n<p>I’m not trying to say that we all should walk around feeling guilty that we’re not sponsoring a refugee or anything like that — quite the opposite. I’m saying that everybody can help just by fighting back against the terror that is slowly creeping into our brains. It’s as easy as a smile. Next time you’re walking or biking around, keep a smile on your face. You’d be amazed at how many people smile back.</p>\n<p>Whenever you feel that inclination toward withdrawing into your shell, remember that is not your nature. That is somebody trying to manipulate you into silence, into complacency, into fear. You don’t have to accept the negativity that is being fed to you every day.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean to say you should ignore it at all; you need to see it, to observe it, to understand it. You need to process it in your own way. But then you learn and move on. You need to remember that you can play for one of two teams: fear or peace.</p>\n<p>If you feed your fear, what do you think you’ll notice everyday? Things that make you scared. You’ll live under a layer of doubt, uncertainty and selfishness. You’ll make choices based on what is best to annul your current fear without thinking about the long-term. That’s not an opinion, that’s science. Fear demands short-term rewards.</p>\n<p>So a piece of advice for this holiday season, and forever, is to choose to be confident, to be brave, to be happy for all the small victories and gifts in your life, to be peaceful and welcoming when you can and to handle yourself like you matter, because you do. You never know how far a smile can go. The more you look for the positive things in this world, the more you’ll find them and, chances are, the more you’ll create them.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, just remember that today you are not a victim, and that means you have the power to change things. You don’t need to be a Senator to enact change. Nothing ever stays the same. So ask yourself, are you making the world a happier or darker place today? You have the power to do both, and whether you like it or not, you’re doing one of them.</p>\n<p>Go out and enjoy this holiday season, even with all the tragedy. Enjoy it extra just to show the world that you won’t listen when they try to spook you. Enjoy it extra just because you can. Enjoy it extra because your happiness might just make all the difference.</p>\n<p>You matter, and even if you die tomorrow, you are creating your legacy every day with everything you say and everything you do. Don’t let that scare you, though. You can handle it.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays from Emile Nelson</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/","id":2595,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[2594,2593,2592],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Winter Warm-Up To Collect Blanket Donations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Santa Catalina’s South Hall Council will be hosting the Winter Warm-Up to collect blanket donations for Santa Barbara’s Casa Esperanza 24-hour homeless shelter until Saturday, Dec. 5.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Santa Catalina’s South Hall Council will be hosting the Winter Warm-Up to collect blanket donations for Santa Barbara’s Casa Esperanza 24-hour homeless shelter until Saturday, Dec. 5.</p>\n<p>The shelter began its annual Winter Shelter Bed program on Dec. 1 in response to the increased number of houseless individuals seeking shelter during wintertime. Santa Catalina South Hall Community Service Chair and first-year political science major Leanna Lugo organized Winter Warm-Up to help provide blankets for the shelter during this time.</p>\n<p>Lugo said the shelter has a shortage of blankets for the estimated 100 individuals expected to arrive at the shelter in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“They suggested I host a blanket drive,” Lugo said. “I went to my advisor and talked to him about it and he said it is a great idea so I began planning it.”</p>\n<p>According to Lugo, the program was a “success” and has received 40 to 50 blankets so far.</p>\n<p>“What I’m hoping for by the end of this week is about 60 blankets, but right now I think we have a pretty good amount,” Lugo said.</p>\n<p>Lugo said she originally wanted to organize volunteering for the shelter.</p>\n<p>“I really wanted to take a group of students to help feed the homeless at Casa Esperanza because I really liked what the shelter stood for and their mission,” Lugo said. “But when I got into contact with them, they were busy because it was November. They were booked for volunteers.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said most donations came in after students returned from the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think people had a lot of used blankets here but when they went home for Thanksgiving break, they seemed to have brought back a lot since then,” Lugo said. “On Monday I started to see a lot of blankets in the boxes. Some people even brought clothes.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Multimedia Coordinator and first-year communication major Carmen Ma said the values associated with Thanksgiving may have prompted students to donate blankets.</p>\n<p>“People start to remember what they’re thankful for and they start wanting to give back because they realize all that they have.” Ma said.</p>\n<p>Ma said it was easy to get students to participate.</p>\n<p>“All people had to do was bring back blankets over break,” Ma said. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Council Environmental Awareness Chair and first-year psychology major Nina Masjedi said she donated to the drive.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a great way to help people and see a direct result on a local scale,” Masjedi said in an email. “It was a way for me to help in the community surrounding me.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program provided people an easy opportunity to help the local community.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure that everyone who attends this school also had to do some sort of community service, so it’s important to keep that going even though you’re already in college.” Lugo said. “It’s important to give back to the community and give to those that need it more than we do.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program can set a precedent for future years.</p>\n<p>“This sort of event is a good thing to continue,” Lugo said. “Even if a homeless shelter doesn’t have a shortage of blankets or if they have enough of what they need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/","id":2609,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2608,2607,2606],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":56,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
