The minor currently provides an interdisciplinary examination of the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBTQ individuals. Students seeking the LGBTQ studies minor will take feminist studies courses in addition to a variety of interdisciplinary courses.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said she wants the minor to connect with social issues from around the world and focus on LGBTQ developments within the UCSB student population.</p>\n<p>“Top priorities will include strengthening the intersections of gender and sexuality studies with race, ethnicity, class, and disability studies from a national and transnational lens, forging new social justice and scholarly ties across disciplines,” Tyburczy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said the minor is expanding with two new courses being offered during next Winter quarter and one new course during Spring quarter.</p>\n<p>“I will offer two new courses this winter: an upper-division undergraduate course called ‘Trans-Art’ that will explore transgender, genderqueer, and gender fluid artists and artworks across genres and geographies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and a queer theory graduate course,” Tyburczy said in email. “In the spring, I will offer an undergraduate version of queer theory.”</p>\n<p>According to Tyburczy, the minor will be tailored to better prepare the student body for future careers in a variety of fields.</p>\n<p>“Students will gain broad knowledge in a growing segment of the national and global population that remains little understood by mainstream institutions,” Tyburczy said in email. “This knowledge can be employed in a variety of arenas: from activism and public advocacy work, to the law and the health sciences, to the arts and educational environments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication major Ciara Baker, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said the LGBTQ studies minor educates students on global issues concerning sexuality, gender and identities and understanding systematic marginalization through critical thinking.</p>\n<p>“I think the minor is important because it produces well-rounded students because of the intersectionality it covers and it also makes students more aware, so that they can be more inclusive and successful in any career that they choose,” Baker said in an email. “The LGBTQ minor allows UCSB students to broaden their field of study and understand race, gender, and other identities.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Madeline Stefani said she is pursuing the minor because it focuses on viewing “gender rigidity” as one of the main causes of inequality.</p>\n<p>“I think that it covers important movements in our history as humans that are not covered anywhere else and gives students the opportunity to explore social issues, especially ones relating to the LGBTQ community,” Stefani said in an email. “It’s another area of marginalization that is not really discussed in the history courses. I think it should be just as important as an ethnicity requirement.”</p>\n<p>Feminist studies professor Leila Rupp said many students pursue the minor to better understand the identities of their loved ones.</p>\n<p>“Some students do the minor for personal reasons, either because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or have family members who are and want to understand the place of sexuality, in combination with other factors, in shaping life experiences,” Rupp said in an email.</p>\n<p>Rupp said students also enter the program to better recognize the problems of LGBTQ members in intellectual and career-oriented domains.</p>\n<p>“Some students pursue the minor for professional reasons, so that in their chosen careers they understand the lives, experiences, and identities of LGBTQ people,” Rupp said in an email. “And still others do the minor for primarily intellectual reasons, because they find the subject matter compelling.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

id=\"caption-attachment-66160\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students Cole Garcia and Ashcon Minoiefar are in the process of establishing a UCSB chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), an international organization advocating an end to the “war on drugs” approach to substance control.</p>\n<p>Garcia, a second-year biology major, and Minoiefar, a third-year history of public policy major, aim to educate students on the war on drugs, explore alternative approaches and promote smart decisions regarding drug use. A group of students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by Shea Gunther founded SSDP in 1998, and the organization has grown to include thousands of members from hundreds of campuses worldwide.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s SSDP chapter is currently going through the campus organization registration process with the Office of Student life and seeking a faculty advisor, but has already been active on campus and has a club constitution. For a chapter to be officially recognized by the organization, it must have at least three students and actively organize on campus.</p>\n<p>Pacific outreach coordinator for SSDP Frances Fu said she can help connect SSDP efforts across campuses.</p>\n<p>“For example, the UC Davis chapter is currently spearheading a Good Samaritan policy at their school and would like to make it a statewide effort,” Fu said in an email. “Part of my job is facilitating those relationships and partnerships.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to help install a local Good Samaritan policy, which would grant legal immunity to someone who calls the police or medical personnel for an injured person.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times a person’s friends or peers are scared of law enforcement and the repercussions that would come with calling an ambulance and getting the authorities involved,” Garcia said. “We’d like to make it easier for people who need help with drugs and alcohol to seek help for something like an overdose.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to convey to students the many effects of national and local drug policy.</p>\n<p>“I’d like for SSDP to educate students on how drug policy is related to a variety of other social issues, like unemployment and the economy, education, health care and racial injustice,” Garcia said. “If students understand how reforming drug policy will improve society in these other areas, then they will understand how necessary drug policy reform actually is.”</p>\n<p>To publicize the new chapter, members have been tabling and handing out information around campus. Garcia plans to eventually hold documentary screenings and invite guest speakers to campus to discuss drug policy.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Catherine Lee says that SSDP will be a good addition to UCSB’s campus organizations because many students do not understand the implications of drug policy and the effects of drug use.</p>\n<p>“It sounds similar to what we learned in AlcoholEdu online over the summer, but I think this program will be more successful in communicating messages to students if they do everything in person through things like guest speakers and events,” Lee said. “Unfortunately, I don’t think most students registered most of the information presented to them online in AlcoholEdu.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he decided to create the UCSB chapter of SSDP because he felt not having a local Good Samaritan policy discourages students from aiding others in in dangerous situations to avoid legal repercussions.</p>\n<p>Like Garcia, Minoiefar said he would like to change local policy to encourage students to intervene in potentially dangerous situations.</p>\n<p>“A big thing the chapter can do is push a policy like the Good Samaritan policy at the university,” Minoiefar said. “The school can put in its policy that if you get help for someone in need … and if it is decided that a person did it in good faith, they won’t be in trouble.”</p>\n<p>As the new chapter of SSDP grows at UCSB, Minoiefar said he hopes to amass a big enough following to continue running the program once both co-founders graduate.</p>\n<p>“These types of initiatives, like the Good Samaritan policy, tend to die out when a student like me leaves because then all the information and things I’ve learned leave with me,” Minoiefar said. “By building this chapter, we hope to be able to create new student leaders who can continue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Bearman also held a Q&amp;A session and signed copies of his most recent book, Drugs Are NOT the Devil’s Tools.  Bearman was a key founder of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic in 1970 and Director of Medical Services for the Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority (SBRHA) for 17 years.</p>\n<p>Bearman began with a 45-minute lecture on the history of  drug consumption,  beginning with Zoroastrian rituals and ending with GW Pharmaceuticals’ 2014 medical trials of Epidiolex, a liquid form of Cannabidiol used to treat epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the history of cannabis use can help people understand modern policy and culture surrounding the drug.</p>\n<p>“The reason that history is important is it helps explain why we have this peculiar attitude towards this substance that has a tremendous amount of healing potential,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>According to Bearman, drug policy in the past has discriminated against African-American, Latino, Chinese, Native American and Irish minority groups, as well as many others.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the word “witch-hunt” stems from Pope Innocent VIII’s Summis desiderantes affectibus in 1484. According to Bearman, the issuance sought to punish midwives (witches) for their use of cannabis to dull childbirth pains, since Church doctrine viewed this practice as heretical.</p>\n<p>“One of the first groups that was discriminated against was where we get the word ‘witch-hunt’ from,” Bearman said. “Witches were midwives and used cannabis to ease the pain of childbirth.”</p>\n<p>Bearman later said hemp was the “oil of the 16th century” due to its use in trans-Atlantic ships’ “sails and rigging,” including those used in the slave trade.<br>\n“Those boats were used for the triangular trade, both sugar, rum and slavery,” said Bearman.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, were especially fond of hemp and grew the plant.</p>\n<p>“Washington wrote in his diary that he so hoped he’d get home in time for the hemp harvest since he so particularly enjoyed being there for the burning of the slag,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>After providing a broad history of drug use, Bearman shifted his focus to the history of cannabis in Western medicine, crediting Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy with first reintroducing cannabis to the Western world.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy had been in India, where they’d been using cannabis for at least 3,000 years,” Bearman said. “They’re still using cannabis in India, at least by the poor, as a medicine.”</p>\n<p>After O’Shaughnessy reintroduced cannabis to western medicine, it quickly gained broad popularity with almost 2.5 million doctor’s prescriptions filled in 1928.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the wide use of cannabis as a legal medicine quickly changed due to policies enacted in 1930 by commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger, serving cotton and nylon corporations’ interests.</p>\n<p>“He was the greatest bureaucrat of all time because he created a problem where it didn’t exist and thus increased his bureaucracy,” Bearman said. “The effort had really nothing to do with marginalizing marijuana — they were aimed at marginalizing hemp.”</p>\n<p>Bearman ended by discussing contemporary medical studies on cannabis and the endocannabinoid system as well as discussing what he calls the “New Paradigm” — the viewpoint that substance abuse should be treated as a medical condition instead of through the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>“The first modern research on cannabis was having to do with seizures in 1949,” Bearman said. “Cannabis is immensely helpful for cancer patients and in fact it may kill cancer cells.”</p>\n<p>Bearman answered a range of questions, including how cannabis affects driving, “big tobacco’s” possible future role in cannabis production and how a change in drug scheduling would affect cannabis research.</p>\n<p>“What the Department of Transportation says is there’s no relationship between impairment and the level of THC,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the role of “big tobacco” in marijuana legalization would have a negative effect.</p>\n<p>“I think the odds are 100 percent and it’s bad,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Jarryd Wafer said he enjoyed the talk and was very interested in cannabis’s potential to treat his type I diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was great learning about the histories associated, where we’re at today and where we’re going with cannabis,” Wafer said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Tara Cseresynyac, who works as Dr. Bearman’s personal assistant, said she was happy about the turnout and is looking forward to future lectures.</p>\n<p>“I was impressed by the turn out; I thought there was a great variety of people,” Cseresynyac said. “There were students, professionals — a huge variety of people.”</p>\n<p>In an interview following the lecture, Bearman said he would be open to giving another talk on campus and said he would like to see broader teaching of the endocannabinoid system at universities.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleased with the turnout. I think people were interested — people stuck around, asked good questions and were interested in the information,” Bearman said. “I’d like to see UCSB have a course on the endocannabinoid system.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Lingerie,” describing the post-9/11 lives of six Pakistani-American Muslim women Friday at 8 p.m. at the MCC Theater.</p>\n<p>Fatima’s play intertwines sex, politics and religion as the six women discuss their lives during a heavily Islamophobic time in America while drying their lingerie. The play aims to dispel stereotypes of Muslim culture and women.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the event represents ideals the MCC aims to promote.</p>\n<p>“This play was really hot — up and coming,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It fit within the narrative and algorithm that the MCC uses, that intersection of diversity, relativity and being current.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the purpose of the show is to educate UCSB students about the often negatively portrayed culture of Pakistani women.</p>\n<p>“There is such a heightened sense of Islamophobia and aggression towards anyone in proximity to that faith in this country that I think anything that you can utilize to cut down at that kind of aggression is beneficial,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think that a play like this might hit the mark for some in breaking down those barriers, and perhaps not for others.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association (MSA) member and third-year CCS literature major Heeba Kaleem said because Fatima is Muslim, her performance will offer an accurate perspective on what it is like to be stereotyped.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just someone who doesn’t know anything about Muslim culture or may have stereotypical understandings of what being a Muslim in America is like, so I’m happy there’s some kind of story being told,” Kaleem said.</p>\n<p>MSA member and third-year economics and math major Nihal Hakim said he thought the title of the play is offensive to Pakistani people.</p>\n<p>“At first when I saw the event name, “Dirty Paki Lingerie,” my first hang up was on just the name, or the use of the word Paki,” Hakim said. “Paki is a racial slur, especially in the UK, but also to a certain degree in the U.S. It’s a word that really brings down a whole community of people.”</p>\n<p>Hakim said the image on flyers for the event of Fatima holding piece of lingerie while wearing a hijab is a false image of what it is like to be a Pakistani woman.</p>\n<p>“It relies on the stereotypes of the Muslim woman — the Pakistani woman — being somewhat different and that difference being an oppression and that oppression can only be alleviated by a very specific type of post-colonial westernization,” Hakim said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she encourages people to watch the show with an open mind despite the backlash from students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage them to think twice and come to the event to think about what the ultimate goals of the play really are,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s not necessarily perpetuation; she’s not trying to participate in stereotyping ourselves or themselves or yourselves, she’s trying to combat them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tobar was the only journalist the miners granted permission to record the story.</p>\n<p>In an interview preceding the lecture, Tobar said coming from an immigrant, Latino family, he felt like an “outsider” in higher education, which he believes ultimately “served him well” as a journalist and author.</p>\n<p>“I always felt like I didn’t get a great education and I was with all these people who had been really well educated,” Tobar said. “It turned out that those qualities that you have as someone who is an outsider and someone who is maybe more humble, those are great qualities to have when you’re a journalist, because it breaks down the barrier between you and the person you’re interviewing.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said one miner he interviewed said he reflected back on pivotal moments of his life in the moments leading up to his ultimate rescue.</p>\n<p>“One of the men told me ‘As I was going up [the capsule], I saw my life flash before my eyes. I remembered things that happened since I was young; I remembered when I met my wife; I remembered when our kids were born; I remembered when I got married,’” Tobar said.</p>\n<p>According to Tobar, the experience of longing to return home and ultimately escaping the mine was like “rebirth” for the 33 miners.</p>\n<p>“What it became for me was a story about men who want to return home,” Tobar said. “They want to be reborn into the lives they had before, they want to go back home to the routines of family.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said interviewing the miners and understanding what they valued amid the mine cave-in caused him to reflect on his own life.</p>\n<p>“In being trapped, in seeing their own deaths, in that time they have to think, they realize that the best thing about them was all the love they brought into the world and all the love that surrounded them,” Tobar said. “That’s what I’ve learned, and as a result of this project I think I value even more my own life.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said despite his accomplishments as a journalist and author, his greatest pride comes from his family.</p>\n<p>“I have many great things that have happened in my life, but the thing that I am most proud of, the best thing about me is that I’ve been married for 22 years and am a father of three kids.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said family is an “extremely powerful force” during challenges times such as the months the 33 miners spent trapped below ground.</p>\n<p>“The miners are back at home and they are fathers, husbands and providers once again,” Tobar said. “They now have the experience of living through an adventure that has taught them the value of the simple things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Maria Garcia said she found Tobar’s lecture interesting because she did not previously understand the intensity of what the miners underwent.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I got a personal perspective on what they went through, how they suffered and what they had to go through after they came out. It was a really good lecture and I’m really glad I got to see it,” Garcia said. “And now I’m looking forward to buying the book because of everything he said, it was really interesting.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Itzel Cruz said Tobar’s lecture gave her an “inside perspective” on the miners’ story.</p>\n<p>“Seeing it on television is a completely different version than it being told by the writer itself, who personally interviewed these people, stayed with them and got to know each one of them on a personal level,” Cruz said. “You can identify yourself with the Chilean miners and the writer.”</p>\n<p>First-year journalism major at Santa Barbara City College Logan Keaton said Tobar is a “great speaker,” and the lecture made him consider the miners’ experiences in a more personal way.</p>\n<p>“I was amazed at how he got so close with all the miners,” Keaton said. “The different testimonies and experiences that all the miners had, those were inspiring and sad at times. It puts you into perspective looking at the world and everything. You can’t take anything for granted.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/","id":2632,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2631,2630,2629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Activist Jennicet Gutierrez To Speak for Trans Revolution Series","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity will host “An Evening with Jennicet Gutierrez” Thursday at 8 p.m. in The Hub as part of its Trans Revolution Series.

On Thursday, Gutierrez will speak on her continued work campaigning for LGBTQ rights and her role as a founding member of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ and Latin@ communities.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said students should attend Gutierrez’s talk because the LGBTQ community is often poorly represented by the media.</p>\n<p>“I figured that it is kind of important to hear the stories and learn the other side about people who are not being spoken about or not being represented in the media in order to learn more about their struggles,” Uribe said.</p>\n<p>First-year computer engineering major Melanie Flandes said Gutierrez is an empowering leader who, by sharing her story and experiences, can motivate others to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“There are not a lot of people I feel would stand up to the president like that, and for her to have the courage and the ability to do that really does make a difference because now people are going to feel like their voices are being heard,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>Flandes said Gutierrez coming to UCSB will empower underrepresented communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing and learning about her story and how these issues [have] impacted her life gives hope that a difference can be made,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Eriko Spurlock said she will attend Gutierrez’s talk in part because she of how much she learned from hearing LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald speak in October as part of the Trans Revolution Series.</p>\n<p>“I found that these events were helpful in increasing my understanding for the experiences other marginalized women go through, especially since we all have different struggles that we each face based on different factors,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said she thinks students should attend Gutierrez’s lecture to learn more about the issues the LGBTQ community face.</p>\n<p>“I feel this event is important for students to come out to in order to open their eyes and gain more understanding for the society, the constructs we live in, and how the current power dynamics are made to marginalize so many people in collectively various ways,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said although the topics of immigration and LGBTQ rights are often discussed separately, it is important to see the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>“Immigration and LGBTQAP+ issues on their own are very important to learn more about and understand, but a lot of people think that these two topics are mutually exclusive when the reality is that everything is connected a lot more than we think they are,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Gabriela Flores said she is looking forward to hearing Gutierrez speak, especially after seeing Shane Ortega, the first openly transgender soldier in the United States military, speak in October, also a part of the Trans Revolution series.</p>\n<p>“I recently attended the one where Shane Ortega came out to speak about his experience as the first openly trans man in the U.S. military, and since I learned a lot from that event, I decided to attend the next one,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Flores said students should learn more about marginalized communities and support their fight for equality.</p>\n<p>“People need to start paying attention to things like this because these discrimination crimes are only increasing,” Flores said. “We are hurting people in our community by not fighting by their side or hearing them out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

McDonald stabbed and killed the man in self-defense, but was sent to a male prison for 19 months, leading to the “Free CeCe” movement. After she was released from prison, McDonald began advocating for LGBTQ rights on a national scale. A documentary film about her prison experience and activist work is scheduled to be released in 2016 and will star Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Sue Aldaram interviewed McDonald, addressing the moment McDonald was forced to defend herself as well as the overall issues of transphobia and racism. McDonald said her attackers were “Neo-Nazi drunk assholes” who yelled slurs at her and accused her of trying to mislead men about her gender.</p>\n<p>“We have the right to be ‘mad black women’ if we choose to be because look at the trauma, look at the oppression, look at the violence that we face on a day to day basis,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said the prosecution argued her attackers’ previous violent history, swastika tattoo and toxicology report did not pertain to the case.</p>\n<p>“[The attacker was] known for beating his partner, who was one of the people there that night who attacked me,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said she did a lot of “meditating and self-reflection” in and out of prison and listens to Beyoncé because it gives her “solitude.” McDonald said she also finds peace in being able to share her story and promote justice for transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Having a voice keeps me grounded,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said reading the books sent to her by supporters while she was in prison, like <em>The New Jim Crow,</em> changed her experience dramatically and made her “question so much.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65719\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1137920179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66067\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65719\" data-attachment-id=\"65719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/cece-mcdonald-answers-student-questions-for-trans-revolution-series/mcdonald_riley-esguerra-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1332&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445503321\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"100\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McDonald_Riley Esguerra-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The things that we were taught, we internalize and think it’s true,” McDonald said. “When will we be able to give our youth <em>The New Jim Crow</em>?”</p>\n<p>First-year music major Jordan Mitchell said he asked McDonald during a question and answer portion of the talk what intersectional oppression she faced within the black community for being a transgender woman.</p>\n<p>“CeCe McDonald critiques with brutal honesty the intersectionality of trans people of color, the prison industrial complex, religious indoctrination in America,” Mitchell said. “She brings her experiences as a light to influence the minds of young individuals at UCSB. She is a voice that enlightens minds of the revolutionary youth.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her feelings on prison reconstruction, McDonald said “there is no reconstruction.” According to McDonald, America takes ideology and turns it into a law then “deems it criminal.”</p>\n<p>“I’d just destroy the shit,” McDonald said. “I’m definitely an abolitionist.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Ph.D. student in feminist studies Chelsea Jones said McDonald’s lecture thoroughly addressed the topic of the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>“She covered all the bases beautifully, connecting the prison industrial complex to capitalism, racism, to transphobia, to basically all of us,” Jones said. “She’s a prison abolitionist and not a reformist, and that distinction is super important because you can’t fix something that is inherently fucked up.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the discussion took place on Thursday, October 29 instead of Thursday October 22.

(SACC) to form one housing student government titled the “UCSB Housing Association.”</p>\n<p>RHA aims to better connect students living on and off campus through collaborative events. If approved by students, the UCSB Housing Association will begin functioning in about five years. It is possible the Graduate Student Apartments Community Council (GSACC) will join as well.</p>\n<p>RHA Vice President of Finance Jacob Johnson said residents could benefit from “stronger” organization and programming services.</p>\n<p>“Week of Welcome could become a lot stronger and more inclusive for those who live in undergrad apartments,” Johnson said in an email. “This change allows greater communication and collaboration with the multiple areas of campus, such as the undergraduate apartments, and I.V.”</p>\n<p>RHA president and third-year psychology major Matilda Mead said the future UCSB Housing Association could provide more leadership opportunities by refining the housing experience for transfer students who tend to be “neglected” on campus.</p>\n<p>“We would be giving them the opportunities for developing leadership experience that come with our title as an association, such as conference opportunities, summer Student Leadership Development training (currently RA and RHA training), additional positions within the RHA Coordinating Board and RHA Councils, and myriad networking connections ranging from within our campus to across our nation,” Mead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Former San Rafael Hall Resident Assistant and fourth-year Asian American studies major Myra Cheah said she favors the change in hopes it will make the transition for transfer students easier.</p>\n<p>“I think programming more heavier, wishing apartments would be great for transfers,” Cheah said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Renee Zapata said living on campus has been a positive experience and she wants to see housing-related student government grow.</p>\n<p>“That’s great to see that RHA is able to improve the living experience for students,” Zapata said. “The fact that it is able to get better than it is, is awesome. I don’t see why students would vote against this change.”</p>\n<p>Johnson said RHA wants “everyone’s input” about the potential change.</p>\n<p>“Our organization runs hand in hand with the student voice,” Johnson said.<br>\n“We are proposing this to the students and are depending on their voice on how and if we should proceed.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Neal will discuss how religion has influenced perspectives on Civil Rights Movement leaders in a lecture titled “Beyond the Black Messiah: Black Lives &amp; the Limits of Heroism,” hosted by the MultiCultural Center (MCC) and the UCSB Department of Religious Studies Thursday in the MCC at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p>Neal’s lecture focuses on the equating of civil rights leaders to “messiahs,” or religious figures, and how this has influenced modern social justice movements. Dr. Neal received his Ph.D. in philosophy and religious studies from Vanderbilt University and has published works about religion, gender, culture, ethics and politics.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Neal’s work is important because he will discuss race, culture, class and social justice-related themes frequently addressed by the MCC.</p>\n<p>“He’s intersecting that with religiosity and postulating the myth of religiosity in a specific group to that of the messiah, and kind of looking through the religious experiences of the African-American community,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “[He is] postulating that all powerful identity and how no one can really live up to it — it’s a lot of pressure — and kind of deconstructing it from there.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the “school to prison pipeline” is an example of the inequalities people of color face in society. According to Mohsenian-Rahman, 0.8 percent of Chicago’s municipal budget goes toward education while 40 percent funds the police department.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a community that has a very large concentration of incarcerated brown and black young men in particular,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “Those numbers can be extrapolated throughout the U.S.; those were just the numbers I had in my head this morning.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said there is no one “messiah<em>”</em> in the modern racial equality movement, but rather an array of people such as Cornell West, Mark Lamont Hill, Angela Davis and Michelle Alexander.</p>\n<p>“They’re hugely involved academically in the activist circle, who are huge change-makers,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said anyone who is advocating or contributing to the “Black Lives Matter” movement is continuing the legacy of previous activists.</p>\n<p>“[They are] doing really incredible and really strong work that is ultimately for the betterment of society across racial lines,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she will be attending the lecture to learn more about race issues.</p>\n<p>“This would be a good way to broaden my knowledge,” Tranner said in an email. “I’m new to this school, so I want to take advantage of everything offered.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she is excited to learn how modern America was influenced by people’s expectations of civil rights leaders.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see what Dr. Neal says and how he kind of links these abstract things almost rooted in religiosity to the current social landscape in the United States,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think it’s really fascinating, and it’s taken me a while to even fully understand what to potentially expect;

Attendees were able to publically share their opinions and experiences afterwards in a mediated safe space.</p>\n<p>According to Zohoori, men who do not adhere to society’s expectations of masculinity can suffer “inner turmoil.” Zohoori said the concept of traditional masculinity affected Elliott Rodgers, the 22-year-old <em>Santa Barbara City College</em> student responsible for the death of six UC Santa Barbara students.</p>\n<p>After recounting his experience of being present at the scene of one of the shootings on May 23 last year, Zohoori said it is crucial for students to foster a better future by encouraging positive gender roles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65861\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"146885196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65861\" data-attachment-id=\"65861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898323\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65861\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><em>“</em>I don’t want anyone to be a victim to anything that caused what happened to me, whether its sexual assault, shootings, being beat up or violence between men,” Zohoori said. “I don’t want anyone to be a victim of any issues with masculinity the same way I was or in any comparable way.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said he mediated the event to allow participants to safely share their experiences without getting “lectured” about the specifics of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I called them out when I needed to, and I supported them. They feel comfortable and we actually got somewhere — we started a good conversation,” Zohoori said. “I’m not here to scold them, I’m not here to tell them what sexual assault is because they all know what it is, they just don’t know how they play a role in it.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said society should support men who do not identify with traditional expectations of masculinity, rather than judge them.</p>\n<p>“The next step is to stop blaming issues with the men, with mental health, and realize that if we keep shit-talking about something, we are not actually going to get the space to support it,” Zohoori said. “The next step is to actually start supporting the people who we feel need it, who we feel like we are blaming, and actually start supporting these communities.”</p>\n<p>IFC President and fourth-year French and philosophy double-major Gregory Rousso said other accreditation meetings have discussed topics such as hazing, alcohol and drug abuse.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a chance to have your whole fraternity there and absorb the information, and seeing that we are all in this together — we are a Greek community,” Rousso said.</p>\n<p>Rousso said he was impressed by the number of fraternity chapters and members who attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We expect 75 percent of all membership to be here and we had a pretty impressive turnout here,” Rousso said. “I think having the majority of every fraternity is huge because, at the end of the day, it comes out of the culture within each house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65860\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1349893753\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65860\" data-attachment-id=\"65860\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898302\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65860\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hechler said sexual assault is the biggest problem for fraternities nationwide.</p>\n<p>“I thought the first step had to be to get everyone to know about what is happening, then we can educate them from there,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma President and fifth-year history major Fady Antoun said it is important for fraternity members to be educated on the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a leader of one of these organizations, I feel it’s important because it is an issue that’s been rampant through our community not just this year or last year, but for all the years that Greeks have been around,” Antoun said.</p>\n<p>Antoun said he appreciated Zohoori’s honesty during the discussion.</p>\n<p>“He actually spilled out his heart up there,” Antoun said. “I know my fraternity and myself we are all about the honesty.

Senator Bernie Sanders as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, is hosting “Chalk-the-Block” Thursday at 4 p.m. to imprint Isla Vista with images and words promoting Sanders’ campaign.</p>\n<p>The goal of the event is to cover I.V. streets and sidewalks with slogans and pictures of Sanders to bring attention to his campaign. As of Oct. 27, the event’s Facebook page shows 243 people plan to attend. UCSB-4-Bernie strategically planned the event two days before Halloween to take advantage of the large crowds over the holiday weekend and maximize views of the chalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year religious studies major Eric Daniel Villalobos said he helped plan the event and UCSB students who support Sanders plan to chalk phrases and questions relevant to Sanders’ campaign, such as, “Are the banks too big?”</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be chalking — along with pictures and slogans — questions like, ‘Is education a right or only for a privileged few?’” Villalobos said. “Hopefully, all the people walking through I.V. during the weekend will stop and notice.”</p>\n<p>According to Villalobos, the aim of the event is to build support for Sanders at UCSB and in I.V. and to encourage young people to engage in politics.</p>\n<p>“We want [to] build on the energy we see here for Bernie’s message and campaign,” Villalobos said. “We want all the supporters here to get energized, to get involved and be active participants in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said all students are welcome to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“All they have to do is show up,” Villalobos said. “In terms of the event, if they want to bring their own chalk, they’re more than welcome to.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said he believes college students are supportive of Sanders because of his stance on topics like college tuition and various social issues.</p>\n<p>“Fighting for free public education doesn’t hurt your standing with college students,” Villalobos said. “He seems to have always been on the right side of history. He got arrested for holding anti-segregation rallies, he marched with MLK, he endorsed marriage equality decades before it became politically expedient to do so.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Nicole Truong said the event allows people to get to know other individuals who share their beliefs and ideas.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to seeing people at the event who share the same views as me, and I’m interested in meeting new people and hearing their thoughts and opinions,” Truong said in an email.</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and economics double major Cynthia Jiang said the event is a good opportunity learn from fellow Sanders supporters.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to meeting fellow Bernie supporters and getting new perspectives from others on issues that surround the presidential election,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>Jiang said she hopes participants and community members who see the chalk will recognize student’s grassroots efforts.</p>\n<p>“What really stuck out to me about Bernie’s campaign and what I hope people will learn about the most is that you can always make a change if you’re dedicated enough to your cause,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Logan Clement said the public should better understand Bernie Sanders’ stance of “democratic socialism,” which is defined as a specific type of socialism which supports public ownership of the production of goods paired with a democratic political system.</p>\n<p>“I like that [Sanders] is pushing for affordable health care and education. I also wish more people understood what Sanders means by ‘democratic socialism’ rather than using that language to disengage from his message,” Clement said in an email. “He’s also one of the most outspoken advocates of racial justice.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/","id":2656,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2655,2654,2653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Activists Host Event To Promote Consent Culture","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Student and local community activists will hold #PledgeforConsentCulture on Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. in front of Storke Tower to promote “consent culture” as an alternative to rape culture...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Student and local community activists will hold #PledgeforConsentCulture on Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. in front of Storke Tower to promote “consent culture” as an alternative to rape culture.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Gabriela O’Neal and local event planner and activist BB Barnett spearheaded the event along with Fuck Your Standards (FYS), a local group that challenges unrealistic standards of physical beauty for women. Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.) will host a booth at the event where participants can make t-shirts and practice asking for consent, and attendees will have the opportunity to sign a pledge for consent culture.</p>\n<p>O’Neal said educating students on consent culture is an important first step in preventing sexual violence on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our message is to actively practice it,” O’Neal said. “One in four girls being sexually assaulted while in college does not have to be the reality.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said the demonstration aims to define consent and promote community participation in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Consent is active confirmation about engaging in sexual activity, and our goal is to teach what that means and the consequences of rape culture, taking steps toward replacing a culture of indifference about rape and replacing it with one of actively practicing consent,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Barnett said ending rape culture must begin with individuals choosing to help end rape culture rather than “shrugging it off.”</p>\n<p>“Our generation is capable of making huge change, but it starts with the individual,” Barnett said. “Society tells us not to get raped instead of not to rape, and if I can inspire people to stand up for each other and their friends, then that is one step forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, the event will call on men to participate in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Getting men engaged and holding other men accountable for sexual assault is huge,” Barnett said. “We want men to stand with us as a powerful statement to further counteract slut-shaming and victim-blaming.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said she hopes to build on the work of other organizations such as #nowUCsb by increasing community support for consent culture.</p>\n<p>“We are now working off of that to engage students on a more grassroots level,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Graduate assistant at C.A.R.E. Sasha Coles said the event will call attention to rape culture in the days leading up to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“People who go to the demonstration will be able to sign a pledge for consent culture, which is especially important with Halloween just around the corner,” Coles said.</p>\n<p>Coles said by promoting consent culture as a replacement for rape culture, the event will “reframe the conversations” about sexual violence prevention.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture tolerates, accepts and rationalizes rape, sexual assault and violence while mistrusting survivors,” Coles said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/","id":2647,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2646,2645,2644],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":59,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
