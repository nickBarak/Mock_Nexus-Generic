There, he helped to facilitate the Central Coast’s first-ever cannabis community and grew a passion for connecting with growers, testifying in court for cannabis regulations and fostering the local cannabis community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spring Quarter 2019, he was approached by the president of UC Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Cannaclub, who reached out to encourage him to start his own chapter at UC Santa Barbara.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The president] said, ‘Zain, you go to UCSB, why don’t you empower the student voice, why don’t you give the students a voice in the [cannabis] community?’” Qureshi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know whether there’s going to be a big interest in [the club]. I didn’t know because I was working with professionals in the field for so long. Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is. I want people of all different majors. It doesn’t matter who you are or whatever you’re interested in,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a place for you.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3</em><em> of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a statement released by the University Council-American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT) on Feb. 1, “the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC has yet to make a serious proposal on any of [UC-AFT’s] key demands,” such as longer-term appointments and fair workload standards. The rally at UCSB was part of a UC-wide movement at each of the campuses in protest of the negotiations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rally garnered a crowd of approximately 40 lecturers and union members. Various lecturers from UCSB shared their experiences on teaching, along with their desires to see improvements in their contracts with the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are creating the next generation of leaders, but we do need now fair wages, fair working conditions and equitable treatment and respect,” Deborah Williams, a lecturer in the department of environmental studies, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we can make it very clear and we must make it very clear to our administration … what is in the best interest of the UC system and our students. And that is to treat us fairly and equitably.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the speeches, people gathered together to sing a song in demand of equitable treatment for lecturers. The statewide UC-AFT plans to splice together videos of the rally songs from every UC campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One speaker referenced the six strikes the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 held for contract negotiations, alongside protests against the university’s alleged illegal outsourcing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes it’s going to be tough, but AFSCME just had three years without a contract. They had six strikes over the period of that time and they ultimately beat the university back on contracting out,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rally continued with a march to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where the protesters intended to voice their concerns and pass brightly colored cards containing student support and comments to David Marshall, the executive vice chancellor of the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the march reached the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor — where Marshall was absent — the protesters passed along messages to office staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We make up well over half of the teaching power of this institution. If David Marshall and other people want us to succeed and want the UC to succeed, they need to pay us living wages,” one protester said in Cheadle Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major point of contention among protestors revolves around the workload lecturers have. While tenure-track professors only have to teach four or five courses per year, lecturers have to pick up seven or eight courses a year at a lower pay, according to James Donelan, associate director of the Writing Program and a negotiator with UC-AFT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher workload forces lecturers to spend less time developing their courses and helping students, whereas tenure-track professors are able to conduct research with the extra time they have available, according to Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feiz talked about how she pushed to expand the teaching of the Persian language at UCSB since coming to the university in 2016 — a move that she said she did out of love for teaching, her students and the language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating these courses, doing these things, I have done it myself. So, if I am paid well and if I have a secure job, I can do these things more,” Feiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have family, we should think about our lives. So, people may think about finding another job, a place that they appreciate and work more,” Feiz explained. “I have 60 students here and I have one right at home too. I need to think about my child too.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Donelan, lecturers have no way to climb the ladder and get on the tenure path. In order to be hired on the tenure track, people have to compete in the university’s national search for a professor; a lecturer cannot be “promoted” to tenure track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get promoted within at any major corporation, but you can’t do it at a university. You can’t change that track,” Donelan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s part of how the university continues a tradition of excellence, picking the absolute best candidates from wherever, but it also eliminates any kind of possibility for lecturers to stop being anything other than lecturers.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event featured three UCSB faculty and staff members who presented about the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-nCoV) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ali Javanbakht, the interim Student Health Service executive director and medical director; Holly Smith, administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator; and Carolina Arias, a professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he three addressed misconceptions surrounding the virus before answering questions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from an audience packed with students and community members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network, in a statement passed out to attendees, emphasized to community members that “coronavirus doesn’t give you an excuse to be a dick to Asian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also described the racism and xenophobia that many UCSB students said they have experienced since the coronavirus outbreak, including “a concerning lack of empathy and solidarity with our campus’s Chinese students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major and member of the Pan Asian Network, talked about her frustration with having to educate people perpetuating racist and xenophobic steryotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China has received criticism for its original handling of the outbreak and the lack of information put out to the public, the New York Times reported. Chinese officials put the latest death toll at 563, and the number of confirmed cases at 28,018; there have been 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. as of Feb. 5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. has put in place screening and quarantine measures for those traveling from possibly infected areas, according to the New York Times. The UC system is following a nationwide protocol in screening patients who have symptoms of the virus and have been outside the country in the last 14 days, the New York Times said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht was quick to reassure teach-in attendees that “the risk to our campus community is pretty low.” The virus has an incubation period of roughly 5-14 days, and “for most people on campus, those who have travelled to or possibly been near an infected person are well out of the incubation period, meaning they did not get infected,” he elaborated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should someone from UCSB be diagnosed with the virus, the school would defer to Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and is still “remaining diligent” in helping students stay safe, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on to detail prevention methods for the coronavirus, which are the same as those recommended for the flu or common cold. “Do the things you should be doing all day every day anyways,” Smith recommended to students while passing around hand sanitizers to the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hand sanitizer, a full squirt, even your thumbs … always wash your hands, [and] if you’re sick, limit contact with others. Eat well, get rest,” she reminded the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not necessary for those who have not been infected to wear masks,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network statement also detailed the ridicule that some students have received while wearing masks to help them feel more protected on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students feel the need to laugh and point at us for wearing N95 masks that are scientifically proven to help prevent the spread of disease,” the statement said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie, a community member who declined to state her last name and who described herself as “deeply involved with Chinese students on campus,” discussed the cultural divide between China and the U.S. during the Q&amp;A portion of the event and the confusion that international students might feel.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If everything they’re hearing back home is that roads are blocked off, everyone is wearing masks, people are being asked to not ride mass transit — everything they’re hearing from the community they trust is that this is a huge deal. And then they come here, and the qualified medical professionals are just telling them, basically, to wash their hands,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comments and questions addressed to the three faculty and staff members made it clear that many students were still feeling anxiety and concern not only around the coronavirus but also around the underlying racist sentiments that have penetrated most discussions around it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just affecting a subgroup of people who have the virus, but the entire Asian community on campus,” Vince Matthew Feliciano, a Pan Asian board member, explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To people who might already feel like they don’t belong, this is just emphasizing the divide between who is Asian and who isn’t.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Interfraternity Council organizations. </span><em>Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force was initially formed in Fall Quarter 2019 in response to a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series of reports</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of sexual assault allegations involving fraternities during the quarter. Much of the discussion at the Monday meeting, which included representatives from various campus offices and student organizations, centered around the recent regulations and how they were being enforced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The policies were] generated through a lot of really collaborative conversations among all of our IFC organizations along with Panhellenic organizations, and [by] communicating amongst all Greek leadership as well as discussing and considering input from other community members,” Stone began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really hopeful that some of this can be translated to all community and campus organizations so that all of those events can become safer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies apply to all Interfraternity Council (IFC) organizations, which include Alpha Gamma Omega, Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Pi, Zeta Beta Tau and Zeta Psi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first policy Stone introduced, and the one he described as the biggest change, was the addition of mandatory “sober hosts” at all IFC events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Essentially what that means is the hosting organization, or organizations… [have] a collection of sober host monitors who are there to take charge, take the lead, make sure that everything is running as it should be. If there were any concerns or any issues that came up, those would be the first points of contact,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In addition to just having those people present at the events, we also have outlined ways for them to be very clearly identifiable,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone also clarified later in the discussion that all sober hosts are required to wear neon vests, similar to those construction workers wear, so they can be easily recognized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s one thing, especially at a crowded event, to be sober or to be in charge. It’s entirely another for other people to know that that [a] person is in charge and capable of handling anything that may come up,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the neon vest requirement is consistent across all IFC fraternities, so that if an individual attends multiple IFC events in one night, they would still be able to find a sober host easily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current required ratio is three sober hosts for the first 50 guests, and then an additional sober host for every 25 additional guests, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to mandating sober hosts at all IFC events, Stone said that fraternities are beginning to set up sober stations that would serve water and act as an area for attendees to step away from the party. Stone added that the station would also serve as a “centralized location” for the sober hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC is also requiring that a sober host be stationed at the entrance of each social event, in order to ensure there is a “competent entry process going on,” Stone said, and so sober hosts can introduce themselves to anyone coming in who might not be aware of their presence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another significant change the IFC implemented was the banning of hard alcohol — all alcohol above 15% ABV — which Stone said was a policy adopted from the council’s </span><a href=\"https://nicfraternity.org/nic-fraternities-vote-to-ban-hard-alcohol/?fbclid=IwAR1TaN_dwv3g5NTXg_UhsN-lkzek0IewPHSVJRlAJlXjf2kz1wbD8cBLMO4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">national organization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That has been a really important shift, especially when it comes to our discussion of blackout culture and the effect that that has in Isla Vista in general,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone also added that the IFC is now mandating that water be served at all social events. He also clarified that these policies would apply for all social events, not just those held in I.V., but also for off-site events like in downtown Santa Barbara when organizations might rent out a venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Selvidge, a representative from the Graduate Student Association, noted during the Q&amp;A portion that she wanted the committee to discuss developing a policy that would address the issue of date-rape drugs, the use of which is often premeditated, particularly since an individual would likely purchase them while sober, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally van Dorsten, the Collegiate Panhellenic Council president, noted that the hard alcohol ban essentially means that there will be no open containers at IFC social events now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s not a lot of opportunity at these events for people to be drugging, because it’s all closed, individual, single container alcohol that is being served to people of age,” van Dorsten said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if the rules that IFC has implemented [are] capable of that reach of trying to prevent people from roofie-ing other people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe this is just beyond the scope of what I think is tangible and possible right now for improvement right now. I don’t know if it’s possible to use these rules to stop people who have a sober intent of hurting someone else,” van Dorsten added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Matthew Feliciano, the vice president for Students Against Sexual Assault, pressed Stone about how the sober hosts would be held accountable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the council had purchased breathalyzers, and has been dropping in on various IFC events to breathalyze the sober hosts. If someone is found to not have a 0.00 blood alcohol level, Stone said the event would immediately be shut down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All IFC fraternities are now required to register their events with the IFC ahead of time, Stone added, so that the council would be able to check on all the sober hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briana Conway, director for Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, asked Stone about how fraternity members reacted to the hard alcohol ban.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would love to hear how members are feeling about a hard alcohol ban — not leaders, members,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone acknowledged that he faced pushback when first introducing the idea, but said IFC spent time talking to not just fraternity leadership, but with general body members at chapter meetings about all the changes the IFC was introducing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, it was definitely not an easy sort of conversation, it was not something that everyone was super excited to sort of take on,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, Conway noted that many students might drink more heavily before the event if they know they won’t have access to hard alcohol at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna make sure we’re not moving the problem maybe earlier in the night,” Conway said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the sober hosts would play a role in this as well, making sure that people entering the event aren’t too intoxicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">van Dorsten added that she’s noticed that even if people are drinking heavily before attending a fraternity event, it’s typically easier to notice — and take care of someone — at a pregame, as opposed to if someone is binge-drinking at a fraternity event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone stressed at the Monday meeting that these regulations were just the first step in trying to reduce harm, or the potential for harm, at fraternity social events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The one thing I do want to emphasize is that this is absolutely an ongoing process for us, as I think it should be for everyone. Risk prevention doesn’t end after you change one rule, it’s ongoing, and it’s to continue to create a safer and safer environment.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-91122\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Klawunn and Armistead led a town hall in fall quarter in which the university addressed criticism about its communication with students after the reports of sexual violence in Isla Vista. <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Task Force for Safer Social Events in Isla Vista heard from the Interfraternity Council (IFC) President Jason Stone about recent “risk management practices” implemented at fraternity events and from the Office of Student Life (OSL) about the way the university communicates with students about incidents that occur in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/message/c5to3e/4at55p\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out to students on Oct. 30 that first introduced the task force, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead wrote that the task force would come up with a series of recommendations to improve safety at social events in I.V. to present to the university by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Task Force recommendations will focus on registered campus organizations, fraternities and sororities, athletic groups/teams, and other social events in Isla Vista,” the two wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representatives at Monday’s meeting ranged from the Alcohol and Drug Program, the OSL, the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office, the Title IX office, the UCSB Police Department and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, in addition to students from Students Against Sexual Assault, Intersectional Feminists, the Graduate Student Association, IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn began the meeting by reviewing the task force’s first meeting in Fall Quarter 2019, during which the task force determined what exactly it wanted to address in its recommendations to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone then presented a series of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/interfraternity-council-bans-hard-alcohol-implements-sober-party-monitors-in-sweeping-changes/\">regulations</a> that the IFC implemented at the beginning of winter quarter on all social events that any IFC fraternity hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regulations include the addition of sober hosts and sober stations at all IFC social events as well as a ban on hard alcohol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sober hosts are designated members of the hosting organization who are required by the IFC to maintain their sobriety throughout an IFC social event and serve as a resource for attendees who run into any problems, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sober hosts are required to wear neon vests, similar to construction workers, so they can easily be identified. The IFC is requiring three sober hosts for the first 50 people at an IFC event, and an additional sober host for every additional 25 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve made clear and we’ve put into place strategies for making those people wholly identifiable,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s also constant across our IFC organizations. So for any guests who may go to multiple events hosted by multiple different organizations, they can identify those people typically in the exact same way,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said that the IFC had recently purchased breathalyzers and have been dropping in on IFC events to breathalyze the sober hosts to ensure they’re being held accountable. If a sober host is found to have a blood alcohol level higher than 0.00, Stone said the event would be shut down immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the sober hosts, the IFC is working on setting up sober stations at all events, where attendees can get water, or find a sober host if they need one. The stations will be in a centralized location and easy to find, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the sober hosts and stations required at IFC events, Stone said the council has adopted a policy from its national organization, the North American Interfraternity Council (NIC), that bans hard alcohol at all UCSB IFC events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, all alcohol at events is single container, CPC President Ally van Dorsten said, which is meant to address the issue of the use of date-rape drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no alcohol that is not single-container,” van Dorsten said. “So there’s not a lot of opportunity at these events for people to be drugging, because it’s all closed, individual, single-container alcohol that is being served to people of age.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force also discussed how the university communicates with students when incidents occur in I.V. Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the OSL, said that communication is often dependent on concerns about immediate safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock and others said the university was trying to create a set of templates for emergency communication so that whoever was responsible for sending them out wouldn’t have to make any subjective decisions regarding the message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the meeting wrapped up, Ashlock asked the task force members to consider what they want from the university during “critical incidents,” and said the task force’s first steps are to define what they consider to be a “critical incident.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there’s an opportunity with this task force convened with so many different perspectives to clarify, put down on paper, ‘What are the things that students have an expectation or a want, particularly, to hear about?’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then from that clarification of what consists of critical incidents, also thinking through… the sorts of language, the sorts of communication methods that we use, the length of those communications, the details repeated or not, whether or not students can opt out of those communications,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot that we could explore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force plans to have its next meeting on Friday, Feb. 28, from 3:00-4:30 p.m. at the Flying A Studios Room in the University Center. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buildings that have now fallen below UC standards are in a level VI category, which is labeled by the UCSB Design, Facilities &amp; Safety Services website as a high priority for correction. These buildings are the Chemistry and Biochemistry Building, Ellison Hall, Music Building, Phelps Hall, San Miguel Towers and San Nicolas Towers, according to the campus-wide email sent out by Garry Mac Pherson, vice chancellor for administrative administrative services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, 99 campus buildings or portions of those buildings have a rating of V, meaning they will require a “second, more thorough evaluation, and any confirmed seismic deficiencies will be addressed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Mac Pherson’s email, engineers have been reevaluating the UCSB campus since 2018 based on new guidelines. The retrofitting and upgrading of buildings is expected to be completed by 2030, according to the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As new science and technology become available, building codes are modified to incorporate advances in best practices and continually enhance building safety,” Mac Pherson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the 1970s, the University of California has been a leader both in seismic-structure research and in developing seismic policies and standards to address the risks that earthquakes pose,” Mac Pherson said in the email. “UC has set its standards for seismic safety higher than those associated with state and local building codes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with the extra precautions taken by the University of California, earthquakes still pose a risk. According to the California Earthquake Authority, there is a </span><a href=\"https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/California-Earthquake-Risk/Faults-By-County?c=santa-barbara\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% chance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of at least one earthquake occurring in Southern California with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus will begin undergoing building upgrades in summer 2021, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Campus leadership is actively working on developing the schedule and sequencing of our seismic retrofit program to align with UC seismic safety policy. Currently for our housing facilities, the goal is to schedule the seismic retrofit projects over the summer months, when they are least likely to impact our student residents and occupancy rates,” Estrada said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plans for the upgrades are not yet complete, so it is not known what aspects of UCSB life will be affected yet. Estrada also expressed that it is unclear what will need to be repaired in order to maintain the high building rating.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30,

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The idea of Quokka Brew was initially ridiculed but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining. <em>Courtesy of Adam Chohan</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student-run coffee company, known as Quokka Brew, was created at UC Berkeley and is now expanding to other campuses across California. As president of the Quokka Brew Ambassador Program at UCSB, fourth-year chemical engineering major Adam Chohan said he is helping expand the brew to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chohan said he first heard about Quokka Brew from UC Berkeley students Ofek Arush and George Passantino, who realized they needed caffeine during finals week in 2018 but found that the anxious jitters and excessive sugar that come with coffee weren’t worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-founders then formulated the idea for an ideal brew that would be an effective energizer and healthier alternative to traditional brews. They soon after consulted with chemists and food scientists in the Bay Area to craft this into a reality, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five months later, Quokka Brew was being distributed in 4-ounce glass bottles around the Berkeley and San Francisco area — marked with a beaming quokka, a small marsupial similar in size to a cat. Containing 15 calories, 1 gram of sugar and almond milk, Quokka Brew is currently the healthiest non-black coffee on the market, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chohan, the science surrounding Quokka Brew’s effectiveness revolves around the circulatory system, where some coffee drinkers experience caffeine’s infamous jitters.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Caffeine normally restricts your veins, so less blood pumping through the circulatory system causes the heart to start pumping harder and counteract that, which is where the jitters and anxiety arise from,” Chohan explained. “The amino acids in [the Quokka] blend act as vasodilators which dilate the veins so blood flows through the circulatory system with the same caffeine intake.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of Quokka Brew — to provide the benefits of caffeine without its negative side effects — was initially ridiculed as an impossible feat but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining, Chohan said. The brew is sold in 10 stores across the Bay Area and is backed by a team of 46 students at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the company transitions into its second year of production, it continues to expand to college campuses across the state, including Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Sacramento State and now UCSB. Across each campus, the company tables, creates ambassador programs and works to get the product sold in nearby stores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps we are taking here are very similar to the steps that UC Berkeley took but they are happening a lot quicker because the response has been really awesome. I think mostly it is because people are very friendly here and students are eager to support student-run business models,” Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While popularity grows on campus, the company is looking forward to making some pivotal adjustments including using a fair-trade coffee roaster and transitioning to aluminum cans. The brew is currently only available at Sam’s To Go in I.V., but Chohan said they hope to soon sell Quokka Brew at the UCen, the Arbor and the Corner Store on campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of

Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was founded by Kavitta Ghai ‘19 and Jordan Long, a third-year environmental science major who took a year off to launch the start-up to provide UCSB students with an alternative to Slack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack is an instant messaging platform generally used by large organizations for communication on the business level. Nectir, on the other hand, is a system based entirely on improving communication at the academic level between students and instructors. Nectir is actively being built into the GauchoSpace program as an add-on, giving teachers and students the option to use it in their class as a tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ghai, Slack is “a communication platform that’s made for enterprise,” meaning it is structured to support business at a corporate level, whereas the two envisioned Nectir as a structure for communication in an academic environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While the idea of Slack is great, there are a lot of problems that make it unusable at schools. They don’t have data privacy for students … [and] it’s insanely expensive,” Ghai noted, adding that there are “a lot of technical problems” with Slack.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Ghai and Long spent two years developing an alternative: Nectir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last two years, the team has met with university administrators, professors, teaching assistants and students. The purpose of these meetings was to understand what problems these people are seeing and facing every day on campus at a communicative level — allowing the team to create real solutions to real problems, Ghai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first classes at UCSB to use the Nectir program was a workshop class in the Instructional Development department led by one of their instructional consultants, Mindy Colin. By adapting her class to the program, Ghai and Long were given the opportunity to see how Nectir would function in reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was designed specifically to create lines of communication throughout an entire school, not just for one class or within one major. In order for students to use the program, professors must create a channel for their class — similar to those in Slack — that will be embedded in their class GauchoSpace site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program had its soft launch in Fall Quarter 2019 and since then, Ghai and Long said that 15% of the people at UCSB have used or currently have access to a Nectir channel for a specific class. It is working so well that, according to Ghai, the team is in the process of signing a contract with the school for funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s goal is that “every single student on campus should have Nectir regardless of whether their TA or professor decides to use it,” Ghai said, by Spring Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose behind Nectir is to solve this “position of frustration” that students feel when they transition from a 30-person class in high school to a 500-person college course, Long explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes days to figure out things, and you’re often alone in the library banging your head against the wall trying to figure something out,” Long said. “We don’t know how to fix it, we don’t know how to create a new educational system… but what we can do is use technology to connect people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghai added that a bonus of the program is that it was created by students for students, as opposed to being created by tech companies who create academic tools without factoring in student perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual set-up of the Nectir program was designed in-house; Long manages all of the technical parts in-house and runs the servers himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves, allowing them to move very quickly through the developing process while not needing a significant amount of start-up money.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we’re starting to reach out to other schools, it will eventually be time to bring other people onto the team, but for right now, for everything we have done at UCSB, it has worked really well with just the two of us,” Ghai added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team plans to first completely integrate the system at UCSB before branching out and attempting to spread the program to other schools, such as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and other UC campuses.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [2/03/2020, 7:49 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jordan Long is a second-year student.

CSD. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) is including the Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC) under its payroll as a parent organization, but the IVCC will continue to fund itself independently from the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it lost its funding, IVCC has been unable to provide stipends to its 10 management and shift positions. Students have continued to work for IVCC on a volunteer basis this academic year, but IVCC has stalled compost collection to the 96 homes it currently serves and cannot expand to the 100 homes currently on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization was created in Fall Quarter 2017 by current IVCC director and fourth-year environmental science major Jacob Bider, who conceived the idea of a grassroots-level composting group in I.V. when he moved out of on-campus housing after his freshman year and realized there was no composting in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider applied for an internship at the Santa Barbara chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and in his application proposed a student-led composting program to I.V. He and other Surfrider interns then began developing the composting initiative, which officially began in Winter Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents in I.V. can apply for composting buckets at their homes to be picked up weekly by IVCC dirtriders –– student workers for IVCC who pick up the bins each week, sort and deliver compost to gardens around I.V. and then bring the buckets back to people’s homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC started in Winter Quarter 2018 by serving approximately 10 homes and proceeded to double in size by the next quarter. A grant from the Coastal Fund in Spring Quarter 2018 allowed them to continue expanding, and by Fall Quarter 2019, IVCC was providing compost services to 96 homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC’s past three years of growth began stalling at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019 when Surfrider notified IVCC that shift workers like dirtriders were not allowed to be paid under a stipend and had to be paid by the hour instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider said in an interview that the amount dirtriders receive on a stipend is equal to minimum wage, and that the decision to have stipends was proposed in its original funding with the Coastal Fund, but that they have now expanded beyond that model’s capacity. Surfrider told IVCC that they needed to switch their shift workers from stipends to payroll, but as a nonprofit, Surfrider didn’t have the capacity to do so. As a result, IVCC dissolved its relationship with Surfrider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main problem the IVCC faced was its lack of a parent organization; the program didn’t need funding, Bider explained — it has a development team that works to apply for grant funding to help it expand operations. But in order to apply for any funding and put employees on a payroll system, it needed a larger organization to be a part of.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC then turned to the Office of Student Life (OSL) to absorb it but found it couldn’t put their shift workers on any payroll system. IVCC also reached out to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) but were told that “due to various policies, A.S. cannot take on the program,” Bider said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider also spoke with Katie Maynard, event manager and coordinator of UCSB Sustainability, and was told that they were already spread too thin and could not take on the payroll for the IVCC; when IVCC tried reaching out to the Department of Environmental Studies, it was told that it’s “not in the nature” of an academic department to take on a project like the IVCC, Bider said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC then reached out to MarBorg Industries, a waste management company that collects residential and other compost. Currently, 20% of the compost collected by IVCC goes to MarBorg in order to prevent overflow of the three gardens that collect compost in I.V., according to Bider. MarBorg also told IVCC that it was unable to take on the group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But throughout the talks with various departments, Bider said there was a recurring name: the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re seeking a partner that can provide us with institutional longevity and because [the I.V. CSD is] a governmental institution with paid staff and a board, you can provide us with that,” he said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director George Thurlow suggested moving the conversation along to the next agenda item in the same vein: discussion regarding the possibility of composting bins at the Isla Vista Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, MarBorg Industries offered to supply the community center with two free composting bins for six months. MarBorg stressed the importance of having the bins strictly managed; if the bins were open 24/7, people could toss in non-compostable items and render the compost useless, Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the option of having bins at the community center, the I.V. CSD began discussing ways for the IVCC to take part in providing a compost service in I.V. — something that combines the IVCC and the possibility of bins at the community center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Jay Freeman drafted a motion to direct staff to draft a memorandum of understanding between the IVCC and I.V. CSD for potential composting services for I.V., while authorizing the IVCC to approach organizations for possible sources of funding. The motion passed 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the IVCC has been stuck in a waiting period this academic year while searching for a new organization, students have continued their work on a volunteer basis. IVCC recently implemented a composting event service, where groups can apply on the IVCC website for composting at its events. IVCC also partnered with A.S. to hold a non-perishable food drive called Food on Wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as we want to communicate the struggles we’ve been through, we also want to communicate the fact that we’re still here and we’re really ready to get back into running and we have some things that we’re excited to promote too,” Ily Logeais, IVCC marketing and communications manager, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logeais said it was important for IVCC to find a group like the I.V. CSD to sponsor it that was just as invested in local, grassroots initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Automatically with the term grassroots, there’s a sense of community involved,” Logeais said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just one person doing it and it’s not a business doing it.

Yang in 1998. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1998 demands called for the establishment of an LGBTQ+ resource center as well as a building in which to house the newly created organization and were meant to address the needs of LGBTQ+ students and provide more services and education, in addition to a space on campus for LGBTQ+ students. These demands ultimately resulted in the creation of the RCSGD in October 1999.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> called for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to be separate from the jurisdiction of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that their umbrella organization did not treat them fairly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the RCSGD’s programming budget to be doubled and for the designation of a freestanding building for the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the demands called for a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding Muro’s termination; the RCSGD and the WGSE disagreed about the extent of police presence during Muro’s firing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately, the RCSGD was removed from underneath the umbrella of the WGSE, and its programming budget was doubled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne Mosbey, the programming coordinator of the RCSGD, said the center has seen an almost sixfold increase in growth between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019. In addition, event attendance has doubled in the same timeframe across 72 programs, which he pointed to as a sign of the program’s expansion.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also discussed the RCSGD’s work in expanding its reach through collaborations with 22 various services and organizations, including Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ampus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and the MultiCultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What this implies is that our center now has connections all throughout campus. So for students who find some of these services that are inaccessible on their own, we’re able to connect them with those resources,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now two years later, with the majority of the 2017 demands met by the university, the largest and most costly demand is the last one left: the designation of a free-standing building for the RCSGD, which is currently housed in the Student Resource Building (SRB).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was one demand put on the list that we discussed with students at the time was going to take a while and [there] would be a much longer process [to it] than the other ones,” said Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion centered around how the RCSGD could go about either repurposing a building on campus, constructing a new building, creating multiple centers in various places in order to spread services across campus or even designate a location outside the bounds of the university in order to better serve members of the wider Goleta and Santa Barbara community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead suggested constructing a building to serve the aggregate needs of several organizations on campus. The Black Student Union has been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a freestanding center for Black students on campus for over 50 years; in March 2019, Yang agreed to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the creation of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/inaugural-director-of-the-office-of-black-student-development-hired-fulfilling-bsu-demand/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of Black Student Development</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and to make the standalone building a priority in campus planning efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have several groups, like the Office of Black Student Development, the Monarch Lounge; we’d like them to have some really nice space and then [it’d] probably be more cost effective to have another SRB for these groups.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also discussed the possibility of establishing a location off-campus to serve as the RCSGD building, as well as potentially partnering with the Pacific Pride Foundation, an organization that provides “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides services to the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ+ communities of Santa Barbara County,” according to its </span><a href=\"https://pacificpridefoundation.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leets, the RCSGD director, said the center could also establish temporary spaces on campus, which could be used by the RCSGD to provide better accessibility to students living in the Chi-5 residence halls and the eastern ends of campus, near the engineering building, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know when I first got here, we had been talking about Isla Vista as where we needed more space, but I’ve noticed that here we seem to have some claim on this side of campus [near the SRB]. But I wonder about the middle of campus where Chi-5 is, and then the other side of campus,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, where the engineering buildings are, I went there for the first time this summer. So like a year into my job here, I had never been over to that side of campus. I think we’re trying to think about how we can have temporary space in those places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexia Duran, a second-year undeclared student, suggested that the RCSGD allow students to have 24/7 access to the center “just for it to be a more accessible space for students,” citing the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“El Centro is open 24/7 and I’ve been there at 3 a.m. and I see people… [who] don’t have a house and students sometimes have to sleep on the couch. Having a space that would provide that for LGBTQ people would be necessary,” Duran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said the RCSGD could also be moved into a number of soon-to-be-vacated sites closer to the center of campus, allowing for greater accessibility and interconnectedness with the Chi-5 dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a couple years down the road, but the university is in the process of moving some of the offices that are in the center of campus, and don’t need to be on the center of campus, off-campus. And that’s going to create some more space,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, several attendees objected to that idea, arguing that the buildings in that portion of campus were both old and in an undesirable state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You look at the Monarch Lounge, like it’s a pretty poor excuse for how we serve undocumented students. It’s a glorified portable, and relocating the RCSGD towards the center of campus will be probably within that space,” said Esmeralda Quintero, a third-year political science and sociology double major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said that feasibility will be considered in the decision, but that support from students will be the deciding factor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not moving the RCSGD at all without student support,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have an exact plan? No. However, things are moving because of new development that’s happening. And so starting to identify our needs now will serve us well so that we can slide in and start moving towards a space that is going to be open in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers and organizers spoke out against some of the Indian government’s practices, such as the lockdown of the region of Kashmir, the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and violence against people protesting these acts, actions which they deemed representative of “state-sponsored facism,” according to the event’s Facebook page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event drew over 100 attendees and featured chants led by graduate student and organizer Pratik Raghu</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speeches from students and faculty members, a recitation of a revolutionary Urdu poem by organizer and first-year graduate student Tannishtha Bhattacharjee and a strategizing session to discuss ways in which people can support the protests in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was organized by Raghu, Bhattacharjee, third-year English graduate student Somak Mukherjee, graduate student Surojit Kayal and first-year film and media studies graduate student Pujita, who asked to be referred to by her first name due to privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the teach-in, third-year College of Creative Studies biology major and speaker Salman Sadakkadulla from the UCSB Muslim Student Association criticized the process required to prove citizenship under the NRC, which declared 1.9 million applicants from the northeastern state of Assam </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> many of whom are Muslims and Bengali Hindus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be stateless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Imagine waking up tomorrow, in I.V.,” Sadakkadulla said. “Imagine waking up without carrying your wallet. Imagine being stopped by [the] I.V. Foot Patrol and being asked to show your birth certificate. You don’t have that? Well, do you have your Social Security card? No? Well, if you don’t have that, do you have your driver’s license? No, you forgot it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants also handed out informational documents, stating that the CAA, which passed in December 2019, “when combined with the NRC, could lead to Indian Muslims, transgender people, adivasis, poor people, dalits, women, those not having land — everyone without documents — being declared stateless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CAA provides a path to citizenship for undocumented Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian refugees escaping religious persecution in countries neighboring India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opponents to the act argue that it does not give eligibility to Muslims nor religious minorities from all countries that neighbor India, such as Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Christian Tamils from Sri Lanka, according to the Economic Times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita, the initial organizer for the teach-in, said in an interview that detention centers built for stateless people in Assam share similarities with migrant detention centers in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The United States of America and Trump and Modi are constantly built on their politics of illegal immigration,” Pujita said. “Words like ‘border patrol,’ ‘detention camps,’ ‘the wall’ — these words that move around here are similar concepts and similar words that are being mobilized [in India] as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the chants from the teach-in elaborated on that comparison: “From Assam to El Paso, detention camps have got to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita was initially mobilized to put on the teach-in after the attacks on </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University,_Delhi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (JNU) in New Delhi on Jan. 5, in which 50 masked people, later identified as members of the right-wing Hindu Raksha Dal, beat students and faculty with iron rods and acid bottles, vandalizing property and “specifically targeting Muslim and Kashmiri students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It was] an act of unprecedented terror that happened on campus,” Pujita said. “I spent six years there and all my political upbringing has been [from there], and I endow all my life and existence to that campus. So that was at once feeling helpless, being away, but also wanting to do things here and tell people what’s going on back home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers from the teach-in drew parallels between the situation in India and authoritarianism across the world. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92462\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"165692605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92485\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92462\" data-attachment-id=\"92462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/graduate-students-hold-teach-in-at-storke-tower-to-protest-indian-prime-minister-modis-administration/india-protest_kaiyi-yang_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"India Protest_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-92462\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year English major Rachel Andrews, a student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, compared the military occupation of the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir  to the occupation of Palestine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kashmir is considered the most militarized zone in the world. Excessive force is used by the army, even on children, and there are extreme restrictions,” Andrews said. “For example, Kashmir has a curfew, and in a similar way, Palestinians are not able to move freely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 370, which granted semi-autonomous status to Kashmir and Jammu, a Hindu-majority state, was revoked in August 2019, subjecting the two states to greater Indian influence and control. Following the revocation, the Indian government stationed tens of thousands of troops in Kashmir, suspended telecommunications and banned public movements, according to CNBC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year global studies and philosophy major Alia Reynolds, another student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, warned that the same pattern of “danger, hatred and persecution” will continue to spread across the world and the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do not engage in the advocacy, policy, prevention, restructurement and revolution that is available to us now, we will fall into the same pattern,” Reynolds stressed. “If we do not fight for the rights and lives of those around the world who are currently being denied those rights or tortured or killed for fighting for them, who will fight for us when our time comes?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers expressed hope through the multidimensional student movement emerging out of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s exertion of authoritarian power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bishnupriya Ghosh, chair of the global studies department, expressed hope for the college students across India that have been launching protests at their universities, most recently after the passage of the CAA in December, and fighting to reestablish India as a secular, democratic republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the attacks on the universities have continued, [at] many universities, there’s been a broad coalition, visibly between Muslims, between Dalits [and] between women and students,” Ghosh said in her speech. “It’s a coalition which is extraordinary because it goes across ethnic and linguistic grounds, religious borders, castes and generations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Raghu, the teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve felt a keen sense of desperation over the past few weeks … over the past few years, really, as authoritarianism has gained momentum in India,” Raghu said. “And I’ve tried to use that sense of desperation to bring others into the struggle.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This set number of swipes expires at the end of each week and cannot be used for the weeks following. In Ferguson and Mitchell’s resolution, the two argue that meal swipes should expire at the end of each quarter, rather than each week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal, as detailed in the resolution, would allow meal swipes to be used throughout the quarter rather than expire each Sunday after dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In order to make full use of student meal plans, there needs to be amendments to how meal plan swipes can be used, by whom, and when they expire,” the resolution reads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states that students with 17 meal swipes per week or fewer should be able to swipe guests into the dining commons with their own meal swipes, rather than be charged a $12 fee for each guest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the UCSB Housing </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/dining/offcampus-mealplan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a standard 14 meals per week costs $1,532 per quarter. Students who choose to live in the dorms are mandated to buy a meal plan, the cost of which is added in with their housing expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a lower-income, first-generation, queer college student, I understand the struggles of not knowing when your next meal may come sometimes. I couldn’t afford a meal plan this year because of how expensive they are,” Ferguson said in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution supports several other modifications to the current meal plan rules, namely removing the cap on how many meals students may donate to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank each week, which is currently at a maximum of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the resolution, the A.S. Food Bank had already been working with Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst to try to implement a policy to allow students to donate more of their meal swipes per week, according to Eric Nava, the Food Bank’s student coordinator and fourth-year religious studies major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with Jill to try to raise this cap for about three years now and the process has been very stagnant,” Nava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nava said the A.S. Food Bank staff supports the resolution and is hopeful that the added support of the Senate position can help them meet their goals in raising or abolishing the current donation cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue isn’t just about accessibility, but also about waste, specifically a waste of money. When something is paid for, it should remain in the system and be reused for students who need those swipes,” said Soha Sadeghinejad, the student sponsor of the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this isn’t the first time meal rollovers have been discussed. Ferguson referred to similar demands made in 2006, when a survey showing support for meal rollover was presented to the UCSB Dining Services director, the Housing &amp; Residential Services executive director and the Residential Housing Association president, citing a previous </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2006-04-04/survey-results-heat-up-debate-over-possible-meal-rollover-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In 2006, On-Campus Senator Nathaniel Wood-Wilde presented a survey to RHA showing that a majority of students supported a meal swipe rollover policy. The RHA were ‘considering the implementation of rollovers in student meal plans’ and were ‘definitely interested to see what works best for students,’” Ferguson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Food insecurity is no joke; it’s a big issue on college campuses, and this resolution is another step in the right direction. Students desperately want change, and through advocacy and support we can make that change a reality,” Sadeghinejad said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 28, 5:23 p.m.] </em></p><div

roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of Bryant’s death sent ripples of emotion throughout the United States and the rest of the world. An icon to many, fans paid tribute to Bryant and his legacy by holding vigils all over the world, but most prominently at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home to Bryant’s 20-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/kobe-bryant-la-california.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Santa Barbara, about an hour and a half away from the crash site, an outpour of roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university was also home to Bryant’s basketball camp, the </span><a href=\"http://www.youth-basketball-camps.com/camps/kobe-bryant-basketball-camp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe Basketball Academy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ran for eight years at the Thunderdome and was designed to help kids hone their basketball skills, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/kobe_bryant_impact_inspiration_santa_barbara_county_basketball_20200126\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of the vigil rested a picture of Bryant and his daughter, a bouquet of flowers and a poster inscribed “RIP #24 MAMBA.” Bryant’s numbers — 8 and 24 — glimmered off the jerseys of students facing the candlelight, while shades of purple and gold draped the crowd from the many who sported Lakers attire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously, if you came out, Kobe meant a lot to you,” Nasrat Hamid, a fourth-year chemistry major and the event’s organizer, said to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of crazy how someone I’m sure most of us have never met before had such a huge impact on our lives. It’s kind of silly when you think about it — I’ve never met this guy but here I am crying my eyes out because he just passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid organized the event earlier that same day after emailing Chancellor Henry T. Yang for permission to hold the vigil, and Yang helped provide Hamid with microphones for the event. After getting permission, Hamid’s sister, Nishat Hamid, said they used social media to let students know an event in Bryant’s honor would be taking place that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid spoke to the crowd first, leaving the microphone open for students who wanted to share their favorite memories about Bryant, the impact he had on their lives and what they’ll remember most about him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students spoke through the tears, those in the crowd banded together, arms wrapped around one another as they mourned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student who took the mic saw Bryant’s death as an opportunity to look back and resolve the negativities in life that weren’t worth the frustration they caused. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have any conflict with anyone, maybe just resolve it and say ‘I love you,’ even in  a friendly way. It’s what Kobe would have wanted,” the student said. “I love that man, and even though I don’t know anyone here, I love you all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just keep powering through [your] own lives and look around and love those near [you] because we are not guaranteed a tomorrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the minutes leading up to the moment of silence at 8:24 p.m. — to honor both of Bryant’s jersey numbers — one student put his phone next to the microphone to play Lil Wayne’s “Kobe Bryant” after asking the crowd if they’d like to hear the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes of silence, students resumed speaking to the crowd as others began to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student recalled how an introduction to basketball — and later, a passion for it — came from Bryant, who inspired them to pick up a ball after watching him on television. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m having fun. Kobe taught me how to love the game,” the student said. “I have this Kobe poster in my room and now I can’t look at it all that much anymore, just because it hurts that much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never got to watch Kobe live, I never got to meet him in person,” the student added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, I will never get the chance to.”</span></p>\n<p>[<em>Correction Jan. 28, 8:33 a.m.]: In a previous version of this article, Nishat Hamid’s name was misspelled.
