and</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately halt to the implementation of phases 1 and 2 of the UCPath rollout until the problems stated in this letter are addressed.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, director of media relations within the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said 99 percent of UC employees have been paid “accurately and on time with UCPath.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each each campus transition to this new system, we plan for unforeseen issues by maintaining extra support staff to stay on following implementation,” Doan said in an email. “The additional staff and resources at UC Santa Barbara will be there at least through the end of the year to help address problems.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan said UCOP has a team in place dedicated to helping students and looking at potentially </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“reimbursing students for interest or late fees due to UCPath complications.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand students’ concerns and frustrations, and we are sorry about the problems associated with any instances of delayed processing of salaries and benefits due to the UCPath transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cierra Sorin, UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) President, said that while UC Santa </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barbara administrators have been working with the GSA to combat the issues stemming from defaulted payments, many of the issues must be resolved at the UCPath hub located at UC Riverside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The problem is that UCPath was designed to decentralize a lot of things, and so a lot of the struggle has been, and I think continues to be, things that our payroll folks and our department officers used to be able to do, they no longer can,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students affected by the defaulted payments can apply for emergency loans, although Sorin believes the program should be more widely publicized in light of the payment issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said that university housing had been flexible with rent payments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin herself had not been paid in October, and as a result was not able to pay for her university </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housing until the end of the month. She said, however, that she had not incurred any late fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What has been happening with housing is people have been encouraged if there is an issue with them being able to pay rent to send an email to housing,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how widely this has been advertised and it’s something I will be speaking with admin about, because I had been hoping an email would be sent out to all folks who live in housing and are potentially experiencing problems, and I haven’t seen one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin lauded the UCSA demands for presenting a unified front to the UC on behalf of all UC students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I see this as is the UC community…[of] graduate students and undergraduate students coming together and telling the University of California that it is unacceptable that there continue to be this many problems with people being paid accurately and on time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA letter writes that UC Riverside and UC Merced experienced problems with UCPath when it was first implemented at those campuses in January 2018, without any structural fixes from the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues continued to occur months after the initial rollout, leading student leaders from UC Riverside to reach out to the Office of the President and the UC Regents last Spring. However, there have been inconsistent improvements since they first came forward and these problems have continued to persist when UCPath expanded to other UCs,” the letter read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB GSA sent out a survey to graduate students to collect responses about issues they’ve run into after hearing from the UC Riverside GSA about their problems with UCPath, Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We heard about a lot of the problems [UC Riverside has] had on their campus, and how they’ve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">snowballed month to month, and so we wanted to see if we were starting to experience those same problems here at UCSB,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside the typical problems like being unable to pay rent or purchase food, the issues with UCPath have left students unable to pay for classes or receive parking and transportation benefits, Head UAW 2865 Steward Avi McClelland-Cohen previously told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 is the union that represents UC student workers, but primarily graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being low on funds due to defaulted payments, students then have to pay more money out of pocket to make up for the lack of benefits, particularly with transportation, added Sorin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin believes the root cause of the lack of structural reform is because the UC was unaware of the issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even here at Santa Barbara, [the GSA executive board] had a meeting with [Anne and Michael </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towbes Graduate] Dean [Carol] Genetti, earlier in the quarter,” Sorin said. “They had told us they were unaware of anything except fee remission issues up to this point because no one had shared information with us about what was happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the UCSA has presented these demands to the UC Regents and UCOP, Sorin hopes more immediate and effective change is implemented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I hope] that President Napolitano and the UC Regents take this seriously, and invest time and energy into fixing these problems immediately such that our December paychecks are delivered on time,” she said. “I’m not optimistic though.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15  print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Elections Board initially mandated a special election for the EVPSA position to take place in Fall Quarter 2018 after Mayela Morales, a current fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, was disqualified approximately three weeks after the Spring Quarter 2018 elections were held. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Declaration of Candidacy period for the EVPSA special election officially ended on Oct. 2, leaving Madeline Loudon, the runner-up in the Spring Quarter 2018 EVPSA election, as the only candidate in the race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote was extended multiple times, as the special election was repeatedly unable to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote ended Nov. 4, with the special election unable to meet the 16 percent threshold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 4, A.S.

Legal Code, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If an executive officer position should become vacant after the fifth (5th) meeting of Fall Quarter, an election must be held by the fourth (4th) week of Winter quarter,” according to Article 11, section 2, (A.1.1) in A.S.

Elections Board held another meeting on Nov. 13, in which Elections Board member Andrew Yan motioned to set the voter threshold for the winter special election to 10 percent, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quan stated that since the threshold for a General Election is 20%, a special election voter threshold for one position should be half of that,” the Elections Board minutes read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria presented the petition to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Elections Board’s minutes, Election’s Board would have begun advertising for the special election after the petition was approved by A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Renteria said he believed the threshold of 10 percent is obtainable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, A.S. Senate passed a resolution temporarily splitting the position’s funds and duties between the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S.

They’re sitting here and they’re just putting stuff together,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added that while hip-hop has become more accessible to more people, some of the core elements of the genre have been compromised in the process.</p>\n<p>Sociology of Hip-Hop will discuss these types of paradoxes in the genre as well as changes in the messages, sounds and producers of hip-hop.</p>\n<p>“I’m really testing the boundaries of, like, what is modern hip-hop,” he said. “How does hip-hop go from poor people to what we’re seeing as rich people music?”</p>\n<p>Mitchell wants students to come out of the class having adequate knowledge about the social context of modern hip-hop as well as how to think critically about hip-hop, its producers and why it looks and sounds the way it does today.</p>\n<p>Discussion topics in Sociology of Hip-Hop will include stigmas, dichotomies of masculinity and femininity, sexualization and desexualization and LGBTQ+ artists and issues, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna give you information and I want you to be able critically assess how do you feel and what do you agree with, what don’t you agree with, what do you know about hip-hop,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell has been workshopping these courses since his first year at UCSB, when the idea to teach a course at UCSB in hip-hop first dawned on him.</p>\n<p>After teaching a hip-hop course at Los Prietos Boys Camp in his freshman year and later teaching a hip-hop class at Santa Barbara City College, Mitchell decided the topic was something that students at UCSB could also benefit from.</p>\n<p>“Hip-hop is actually very complex and complicated. It’s also very hands-on. People can learn that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said the legitimacy of hip-hop as a serious musical genre is sometimes undermined by beliefs about it being too simple and too distant from the pillars of music theory. He expects there to be some criticisms of the hip-hop classes from colleagues and faculty once the class begins.</p>\n<p>“I have people that will love the class in the music department … and then a lot of people will for sure hate it and don’t like that it’s intentionally going away from Western pedagogies on purpose and intentionally not doing what my teacher taught me,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>These courses are offered through a program that allows students in the College of Creative Studies to teach a course during their time at UCSB. Students in the program must present syllabi and teaching plans for the course before they are approved to teach it, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Mitchell worked on his plans for the courses throughout summer, having to make many changes throughout the process and prove the classes to be legitimate, educational courses.</p>\n<p>As far as he knows, this is the only time the classes will be offered, as Mitchell knows of no one who would be interested in taking over the class once he graduates.</p>\n<p>Mitchell hopes these courses will show students not only that music education can be an advantageous career path but also that they have the capability of being successful in whatever they choose to do in the future.</p>\n<p>“Music’s not worthless at all. I want people to embark on that,” Mitchell said. “I just care about influencing people to do the best in what they want to do.”</p>\n<p>After graduating, Mitchell plans to obtain a masters degree in music education and return to his alma mater in Stockton to teach music and composition in hip-hop production.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As of now, Kopel says the new members of the council, once appointed, and Alonso will decide on a chair amongst themselves and then present their recommendation to Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Kopel agrees, she will send their recommendation to the Senate.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

A student must first provide documentation that all other options have been exhausted in order to qualify.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are meant to assist students that are suffering through a one-time housing emergency that could force them to relocate, jeopardizing their education at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Miller, five students have been assisted by the program already and that number is expected to rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is a joint partnership between Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Services, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the Financial Crisis Response Team, according to Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding comes from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program works to estimate and assess the needs of students. It also serves to identify students who might be experiencing more systematic financial difficulties so as to direct them to resources that can provide them assistance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an effort to help address the growing basic need requests we have been seeing here on our campus, which unfortunately is a national trend due to the increasing cost of higher education,” Miller said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A process will be in place to notify landlords that a student is working with the housing voucher program, said Miller. Communication between landlords and the program is key to buying the student time to receive funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hopeful our relationships in those areas will be fruitful in buying us the time needed to sort through these issues which can sometimes be complicated,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources from UCHS will be utilized in the program, such as UCHS mediators that are in place to settle disputes between tenants and landlords.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each case is carefully addressed and verified through the Financial Crisis Response Team to prevent misuse of the vouchers, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are also either directed into the student’s BARC account or addressed as checks to their landlord, Muñoz said. No cases of misuse have been reported yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The housing voucher program is the first step in creating a safety net program for students struggling financially, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we make programs like this, I want to make sure they’re sustainable long-term, so we’re not just offering a service for a couple of years, then seeing it go away,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really need to see what kind of volume we’re going to see and go from there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can submit an application to the Financial Crisis Response Team by emailing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financialcrisis@sa.ucsb.edu</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

She also spoke of where the movement stands now, a year after #MeToo gained viral attention.</p>\n<p>In the larger political sphere, Burke’s presence on campus was timely; introduction speaker Celesta Billeci, Arts &amp; Lectures Executive Director, noted Burke’s appearance was just one day before the midterm elections where more women ran for office at record numbers.</p>\n<p>Burke weaved together anecdotes of her activism in a lecture that was surprisingly humorous, given the heavy nature of the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>What was unsurprising was the humanity and personal touch, as seen in both her lecture and at a reception held immediately before. The reception, held in the Mosher Alumni House, welcomed a group of 40 to speak to Burke before her Campbell Hall Lecture.</p>\n<p>Students were selected to attend the reception through the Black Studies and Feminist Studies Departments, which co-hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Burke went from table to table during the Mosher House reception, asking about students’ majors.</p>\n<p>She also reflected to the group on what the #MeToo movement still has to accomplish.</p>\n<p>“It just pains me that survivors have been forgotten. We have built this movement on the stories of survivors…for what?”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. peer educator Jasmine Wahab described speaking with Burke as shocking.</p>\n<p>“She’s just so influential, so incredible,” Wahab said.</p>\n<p>Burke’s lecture focused not only on her own work in activism, but how the #MeToo movement has changed since its viral re-emergence in 2016. The Kavanaugh hearings in September were a reminder to Burke of how much work remains in the national conversation around sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I thought that we were further along than we were… [the Kavanaugh hearings were] a missed opportunity to examine what accountability looks like,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>Burke said the hearings became too partisan, and that led to people forgetting the greater message regarding Kavanaugh’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“There’s a straight line in my mind between a 17-year-old Kavanaugh… who was not told ‘no’ very often, and the 57-year-old man who has an unchecked amount of power and can make choices about my body,” she said.</p>\n<p>In her lecture, Burke spoke candidly about the difference between the media’s perceptions of the #MeToo movement and the work which the organization is accomplishing, which she described as #MeToo “writ large and writ little.”</p>\n<p>Those who see the #MeToo movement as just a hashtag are only seeing the “writ large,” according to Burke.</p>\n<p>Over 12 million people posted #MeToo on Facebook just 24 hours after its use by actress Alyssa Milano on Oct.15, 2017, but Burke reminded the audience that “every single hashtag is a human being.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84863\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84863\" data-attachment-id=\"84863\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-11/metoo-founder-tarana-burke-speaks-at-ucsb/jenny-luo_tarana-burke_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo_Tarana Burke_ONLINE-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84863 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burke spoke to a full crowd Tuesday night.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Burke does not view the #MeToo movement as sustainable if it remains tied only to social media.</p>\n<p>“What they have done is not sustainable, not a movement, but a reaction to a moment. […] it’s a distraction from our real work,” she said.</p>\n<p>Sustainability comes from #MeToo “writ little,” which includes everything behind the hashtag.</p>\n<p>“Me Too is a global community of survivors committed to healing and action, including marginalized survivors of all identities, including queer and trans. The rest is a distraction from that,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>“Do recognize the urgency of this movement. Think of those waiting to be seen, to be heard, to be believed.”</p>\n<p>Burke plans soon to expand #MeToo mission beyond the hashtag. New work including survivor leadership training will be unveiled in January 2019, while a new website will be completed in April.</p>\n<p>“[The website will be] the most comprehensive website for survivors of sexual violence,” Burke said, to the eruption of applause from the audience.</p>\n<p>While #MeToo is about the stories of individuals, Burke emphasized in her lecture that the movement emphasizes community healing, changing the culture of sexual violence through law and policy changes.</p>\n<p>This change in culture can happen at the college level, Burke said.</p>\n<p>She personalized her message on Monday to UCSB in particular by reading UCSB’s mission statement aloud, describing the commitment to sustainability as brilliant.</p>\n<p>Burke also challenged the administration to examine how UCSB’s policies regarding sexual assault can fit this mission. The power in the mission statement, according to Burke, is having a “clear guide to create policies and shift culture.”</p>\n<p>“Students, this is built around you. Not the founders, not the board of trustees. You have the power now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Trump administration’s proposed redefinition of gender would leave transgender students at UC Santa Barbara stuck in limbo between federal and state guidelines, according to Craig Leets, Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director.</p>\n<p>Leets said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications particularly with passports, social security cards and insurance benefits.</p>\n<p>He has been working to advocate for LGBTQ students in higher education since 2012.</p>\n<p>“It’s really complicated for a trans person to get their gender marker with the federal government,” he said. “If [the redefinition] were to go through, there would be no chance at all for a trans person to change that gender marker that is on record with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Transgender students travelling internationally run the risk of being held up in airports, both domestically and internationally.</p>\n<p>“Their appearance might align with one gender and [if] their gender marker on their passport says something different, that can cause problems for people who are going through customs,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies that operate across state lines would also be able to deny transgender students’ benefits, particularly to cover mental health or transitioning expenses, despite California’s more progressive laws.</p>\n<p>“Many things are more than just state-specific… which is where federal guidelines come in,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>California Senate Bill 179, which was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in Oct. 2017, would allow California residents three options for their gender on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates: male, female and nonbinary, which is denoted by an ‘x.’</p>\n<p>The law fully goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the Trump administration’s attempts to redefine gender could override the state law.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government were to change that definition it could really impact all of the progress that has been made,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>On UCSB’s campus, students would not see any effects to the protections they are already afforded by the university and the state of California.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has a nondiscrimination policy, and there are a set of protected classes who are legally protected in the state of California… so someone cannot be discriminated against in accessing housing or employment based on their gender, gender identity or gender expression,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“So our nondiscrimination policy, which aligns with those protected classes here in the state of California, would not be impacted or affected.”</p>\n<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is currently working on two efforts to support transgender students on campus: first, by providing a community-building space for trans students on campus and second, by implementing policy changes within the university.</p>\n<p>Currently, the center is working on cataloging the number and location of all-gender restrooms on campus. They are also trying to expand the preferred name option on Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.) to include pronouns.</p>\n<p>According to Leets, there are approximately 70 all-gender restrooms on campus, with the majority of those being single-stall restrooms.</p>\n<p>Through the RCSGD’s work to establish a map of all-gender restrooms on campus, it has identified a corridor on Ocean Road by the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education and Robertson Gym where there are several buildings without a single all-gender restroom.</p>\n<p>“If a student is in one of those classes, one of those buildings or they have multiple classes in those buildings, it’s really hard for them to find a restroom space that’s close enough by for them to get between classes or for them to go during a class,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Leets would like to establish several all-gender restrooms in all buildings on campus, but says the more realistic goal is at least one in every building “so a student or faculty or staff-person would not have to leave the building that they’re in to have an accessible restroom option.”</p>\n<p>The RCSGD is currently in the inventory phase of the project. Once it identifies priority spots, like the Ocean Road corridor, it will begin requesting funding and approval to convert existing restrooms to all-gender restrooms.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center is also working with the university to expand the preferred name option already available for students.</p>\n<p>For students who have not or cannot change their legal name, they can currently change their preferred name on G.O.L.D. This change will be reflected in numerous locations including their access card, GauchoSpace, G.O.L.D., advising records, the online campus directory and housing rosters.</p>\n<p>“In many places, students will be able to see their preferred name and not have to interact with their legal name. That system is pretty good; we’re just trying to make sure it’s as good as it needs to be,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>As a partner project, they are also working toward including pronouns in the university system in the same places the preferred name already appears.</p>\n<p>Despite the work they’ve already done, projects like these often take longer than the center hopes them to.</p>\n<p>“I think many people want to do that work [to support trans students] and are excited to do that work … The challenge that comes from any large organization [is], ‘Is the money there?’, ‘What’s the technical complications of making these changes,’” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center works closely with Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Maria Herrera-Sobek.</p>\n<p>“Our role on campus is to be the leaders of the advocacy and improvement on campus for trans students,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“[The administration is] supporting the work that we are doing and help[s] us to make movement when we can’t ourselves to try and make campus more welcoming for trans students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Brown Act of 1953 “guarantees the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies,” according to a pamphlet published by the California Attorney General’s Office in 2003.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The act requires that all boards, commissions and councils publicly detail the items they plan to discuss in closed session before closing the meeting to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closed meetings are those in which the public and executives are excluded,  Safadi said.</span></p>\n<p>Safadi explained the Brown Act applies to the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate because of academic senate clause.</p>\n<p>“In 66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 252 (1983), it is concluded that the meetings of an academic senate of [colleges] are subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act,” Safadi said to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“[Academic senate is] a blanket statement that covers all forms of legislation in universities… that is what I understood it to say,” she added. “Furthermore, the Brown Act is directly referred to in the [A.S.] legal code and thus associated students has subjected itself to its bylaws.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week’s closed session was unusual in that Senate asked A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho and A.S. Executive Director </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Márquez </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to leave as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As an individual who was explicitly stated to not be a part of the closed session, I also cannot comment on what was discussed since I was not permitted to be present,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo first motioned to go into a closed meeting to </span>“to discuss internals,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cornejo rescinded his initial motion but made a second motion around 7:30 p.m., this time specifying that the meeting would discuss “internals of A.S. and increasing accountability with senators and proxies only.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi sent out an email to all A.S. executives, senators and advisors on Nov. 2, warning senators that they “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must adhere to the Brown Act in its fullest capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Violations [of the Brown Act] may result in external litigation and repercussions,” Safadi said in the email obtained by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The attorney general simply informed senators on how to go about closed sessions,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate must include both intent to have a closed meeting and a description of the content of the closed meeting that is descriptive enough to provide the public with a semblance of the topic, according to Safadi’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they take any action during the meeting, the Senate would be required to disclose those votes or actions to the public within 24 hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate is only allowed to go into closed session to discuss personnel, public security, pending litigation, labor negotiations and real property negotiations, according to the Brown Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi highlighted personnel and pending litigation in her email as the two reasons more relevant as to why Senate would hold a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 8]: This article’s title was updated to “A.S.

into this difficult decision,” Tri Delta’s national president, Kimberlee Di Fede Sullivan, said in an email sent out to members of the sorority Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it was made by the Executive Board, in concert with Gamma Theta’s chapter volunteers and Executive Office staff, with heavy hearts for all involved.”</p>\n<p>Sullivan cited a decline in membership numbers as the reason for shuttering operations.</p>\n<p>“Despite the hard work and dedication of the chapter and the continual support of volunteers and staff, Gamma Theta has not achieved quota since 2012 and currently remains significantly below total,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>According to the email, the suspension will last for a minimum of four years, but the chapter hopes to return “at a time that is mutually beneficial for Tri Delta and the university.”</p>\n<p>New members will be offered the option of becoming a sister but would be an unaffiliated collegiate member – an alumnus of the sorority – after June 14, 2019. New members are also allowed to join another sorority at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Students currently living in the house will continue to have housing for the rest of the academic year.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The two organizations have spent the past few months preparing for the midterm election.<em> Courtesy of College Republicans, Campus Democrats respective Facebook pages</em></p></div>\n<p>The two organizations took different approaches in preparing for the Nov. 6 election. Campus Democrats focused on registering voters and getting out the vote, while College Republicans created spaces for discussion and informed students of the issues.</p>\n<p>Both groups have been actively canvassing for their respective endorsed candidates.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats has devoted efforts to register voters, according to Campus Democrats President Aisha Khan.</p>\n<p>“Preparing for midterms is [about] maintaining that focus we’ve had since our beginning to educate young people about politics, politics locally, how they can get involved and why it’s important,” Khan, a third-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Since January 2018, Khan said Campus Democrats has registered 9,513 voters in the Isla Vista and UCSB communities.</p>\n<p>This includes the concentrated registration efforts during UCSB’s winter and spring quarters for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats members tabled in the Arbor and the University Center almost every day from the beginning of the 2018-19 school year to register voters, Khan said.</p>\n<p>They also had stations around campus and I.V. on Oct. 22, the last day to register.</p>\n<p>College Republicans does not focus on registering voters and instead focuses on providing an open forum for discussion to students about the issues and candidates, according to College Republicans President Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve hosted events for people to watch the presidential debates and the Republican candidate debates,” Garcia, a fourth-year Middle East studies and political science double major, said.</p>\n<p>“I think that the purpose of our [organization] is to create a space for discourse which isn’t really found on campus.”</p>\n<p>In addition to open general meetings, College Republicans hold public forum events throughout the year, such as the event held in the Hub on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The organization also holds speaking events and often dedicates large portions of time during those events for debate and questions.</p>\n<p>“Becoming engaged in a space where you are capable and there is an opportunity for you to debate your positions, that really does tend to [make] people [want] to be more knowledgeable and more involved in the political sphere,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating spaces for students to discuss and learn more about politics, both organizations have been canvassing for candidates aligned with their respective views.</p>\n<p>“One way that we have remained involved in the [upcoming] midterm elections is canvassing for Justin Fareed,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Fareed is a Republican Congressional candidate in the 24th congressional district. The district is currently represented by Salud Carbajal, who is endorsed by the Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>The organization has been knocking on doors and speaking to voters in Goleta and Santa Maria leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also gotten involved with the No On Prop 10 campaign, so we’ve been making phone calls for them about two or three times a week, about five of our members each time,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>California Proposition 10 would repeal the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506\">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a>, a state law enacted in 1995 that places limitations on the power of city governments to control rent.</p>\n<p>Now that voter registration has ended, Campus Democrats has also doubled down on campaigning for local candidates and issues.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats “has been a volunteer for local Democratic campaigns” since its inception. The organization also has close ties with the campaigns of incumbent congressman Salud Carbajal and incumbent assemblywoman Monique Limón, according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“It’s about emphasizing the importance of local politics and the power that we have here locally,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>The organization has been canvassing for its slate of endorsed candidates as well as the passing of Measure G and California Proposition 10 by calling voters and going door-to-door in Santa Barbara, Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“People get exposure to what it’s like [to work on] on a real political campaign,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Khan and Garcia both emphasized the importance of students exercising their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Garcia highlighted the importance of educated and informed voting as a key mission of College Republicans.</p>\n<p>She noted the influence of the political climate on conversations about the election with community members.</p>\n<p>“I think the majority of students are left-leaning, but I don’t think they’re so left-leaning that they’re completely shut down to discourse,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“In the past year or two, there have been a lot of situations on campuses where events are shut down and students are harassed or assaulted because they are putting their political opinions out there. I don’t think that’s a thing that really happens here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>She said she believes elections such as the midterms can be overwhelming for first-time voters and individuals new to the U.S. political sphere.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats also keeps the age of its intended audience in mind, and the organization’s main goal is “to educate and empower young people about politics,” according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of us, we are really new to politics so it’s a unique opportunity to have a very powerful voice and [change] something when you are brand new to it,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>“There are not that many places in the country where young people’s votes are concentrated in an area and Isla Vista is one of those places. It makes a really big difference locally.”</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

students to vote in the External Vice President for Statewide Affair (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>The sole candidate for special election, Madeline Loudon, currently works within the office in a separate position.</p>\n<p>Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, ran on a platform of lowering tuition, expanding sexual assault resources and advocating for students and workers with disabilities, according to Loudon’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The board briefly considered halving the threshold, but decided against it after agreeing that “the pre-determined voter threshold is not modifiable while the election is already in place,” Renteria said in a statement sent out Sunday.</p>\n<p>“It is important to note that the Elections Board only rules on the Elections process.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event was organized by Senator Solomon (left). <em>Courtesy of Zion Solomon</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB students, led by UCSB Associated Students Senator Zion Solomon, organized the “Trans Joy Take Over” to increase visibility within the trans community.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring a positive movement and show trans people that they are seen and visible and show people why it’s important to show solidarity with trans folks even if they aren’t trans themselves,” said Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major.</p>\n<p>The effort consisted of card- and poster-making activities on Monday and Tuesday in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) room, located within the Student Resource Building (SRB).</p>\n<p>Students also tabled in the Arbor on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>These events were supported with funds from the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and RCSGD, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>“I know that suicide rates for trans people are rising and it’s not good for the mental health of trans people to be seeing this in the media, so regardless of whether they’re home or here, people are affected by it,” they said.</p>\n<p>Several other volunteers joined Solomon in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Andres, a second-year sociology major, expressed that this event could be very informative and valuable to people without much knowledge of the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“I think having visibility, having trans flags and rainbow flags out here and all of our signs really can leave an impact on someone who might not know a lot about the trans or LGBTQ+ community,” Andres said.</p>\n<p>Diego Reyes, a second-year biology major who tabled on Thursday, is adamant about the drastic implications the Trump Administration’s policy might have.</p>\n<p>“I know there are a lot of people who have their own opinions on what being transgender means and about what being non-binary means,” Reyes said. “I feel like that passing gives them a pass to spread trans antagonism and trans hatred… And I think if that passes then it’s gonna come back probably a hundred times worse [than it already is].”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“It’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB’s administration has “been pretty responsive to trans needs” but always has room to improve, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Their primary concern is how the environment created by students on campus for transgender people could potentially see a big change following the gender redefinition policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that this will affect this university’s response. Maybe the students’ response and maybe transphobic people at this university, but I think we should still be pushing the university to support trans students regardless of whatever the administration says,” Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Riley Hsieh, a second-year political science major, talked about the importance of support from allies who extend beyond just the queer and trans community.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important that we have allies in the community… because it’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n<p>Ivana Cruz spoke about how mistakes in pronoun use, whether deliberate or not, can feel invalidating and isolating, “especially in academic circles.”</p>\n<p>“Even if there’s a slip with a pronoun and they don’t take time to acknowledge that, it can really intimidate you from an already-intimidating process of reaching out to your professors.”</p>\n<p>However, Cruz stressed that solidarity can lead to progress and inclusivity and positive change.</p>\n<p>“I try to look at what’s possible. I look at the fact that 20 years ago we wouldn’t be having an event like this. We wouldn’t be having open conversations about pronouns without being laughed at. They, them would still be grammatically incorrect,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>“I just think that we as a community have a responsibility to grow more and that’s essentially what’s going to lead to a very progressing change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

equipment located near Koenigstein Road, so SCE has not yet been able to inspect it. “SCE will not be able to determine the specific cause of the Koenigstein Road ignition until it can analyze the equipment currently in CAL FIRE’s possession.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, SCE is conducting an ongoing study regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire. This study takes an in-depth look into possible ignition points and fire progression from each point, among other factors.</p>\n<p>SCE is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S., serving about 15 million customers in Southern California, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire devastated the Santa Barbara area last December, burning over 281,893 acres of land. It was the largest fire in California history at the time, until it was surpassed by the Mendocino Complex Fire in July 2018.</p>\n<p>During the fire, UC Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\">opened</a> its recreation center to evacuees from the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Associated Students Senate also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/a-s-senate-allocates-5000-to-help-students-head-home-during-thomas-fire/\">allocated</a> over $2,000 to students who needed to return home because of the fire. UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">cancelled finals week</a> for Fall Quarter 2018 due to the unsafe conditions on campus.</p>\n<p>The fire burned the soil, preventing it from being able to absorb the heavy rainfall that followed, thus leading to the Montecito mudslides which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\">killed</a> over 20 people in January and forced thousands to evacuate.</p>\n<p>The findings come as SCE faces multiple charges relating to the Thomas Fire, including from attorneys representing local residents and the City of Ventura.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
