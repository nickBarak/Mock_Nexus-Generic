Students can expect to receive an email invitation to join Handshake around June 16. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services suggests students download any important documents from Gaucholink before the end of Spring Quarter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gaucholink, Handshake connects students to employers and provides potential internship opportunities by allowing students to share their resumes and search and apply for jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services counselor and coordinator Eric Wilder said </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake allows students to create a “more in-depth profile,” which he said will allow them to more easily find jobs and internships as well as interact with employers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers searching to recruit college students are able to access Handshake and view the resumes of applicants, which are directly displayed on the students’ profiles, and post employment or internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is designed to provide organizations with a “single login experience” in which they can find all the necessary information about a student on one interface. Career Services staffers believe this will encourage employers to interact more with the website and the students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services expects Handshake to provide an “easier” and more “user-friendly” interface that will increase communication between companies and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students can access a much wider array of employment and internship opportunities [with Handshake],” Wilder said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also uses algorithms “similar to the ones on Netflix” to match students with jobs or internships that correspond to their interests and areas of study. It is for this reason that Handshake provides a more “fluid experience” for both students and employers, Wilder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake additionally allows students to look for career fairs, establish interviews with prospective employers and search for other career-related events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are looking into future rollouts that will allow students to easily identify career events and resources that match their interests,” Wilder said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/","id":2383,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2382,2381,2380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scam-Free Ticketing Platform Wins New Venture Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first place prize of $10,000 to continue the development of their company.

The seller made 10 copies of the exact same ticket and sold it to 10 different people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So every day, for the next three days of the festival, it was a race to be the first in line. Only the first ticket would show up as valid, and the other nine would be invalid,” Martitsch said. “So needless to say, this was a terrible experience for me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, a team developing THC- free marijuana, won the second place prize of $7,500 and the $5,000 Elings award for a total of $12,500 — walking away with the most cash prizes. California recently passed Proposition 64, legalizing marijuana, which leaves them with no close competition anywhere in the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, a website designed to make subleasing easier, won $5,000 dollars for third place. The six team members are all part of Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikha Sharma, a fourth-year political science major, said he thought of the idea for the website after having a difficult time finding housing while interning in New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s choice award went to Collatera, a startup that has created a bandage-type patch which could be applied on diabetic foot ulcers. It heals foot ulcers up to four times faster than similar patches currently on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team won $5,000 as well as a honorary award of $2,500. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has completed trial studies on mice and will start live clinical trials at Harvard University and Tufts Medical Center this summer. Two members of the team will be moving to the East Coast after they graduate in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters received the second honorary award. The team members seek to partner with poultry farmers and collect bird waste to make into fertilizer, which helps the environment by disposing of byproduct in a profitable manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PhantaField won the third honorary award, and its members are currently developing augmented reality glasses. After the competition, their goal is to make their product into a reality and acquire funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With our expertise and my 15 years of semiconductor experience, we think we can solve these problems, but it’s uncovering the next problems that we don’t know about yet that are the real challenges coming up,” Dylan Rodriguez, a graduate student in the technology management program, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team PhantaField said their mentor, Alexander Fang, former UCSB student and former owner of local company Aurrion, has helped them by sharing his own experiences developing Aurrion at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through Aurrion, Fang developed nanofabrications. While he sold the company to Juniper Networks, a technology company based in Sunnyvale, the company is still focused on nanofabrications.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodriguez said since Fang sold the company, he has more time on his hands to give back to his alma mater by helping aspiring entrepreneurs through events like New Venture.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His expertise has been immeasurable. It’s just been great having him as an advisor,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Master of Technology Management is the main focus of the Technology Management Program. Graduate students in the program must partake in an intensive nine-month program that aims to produce future tech industry leaders and provide them with mentors and advisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, Entrepreneurship Program Director at the Technology Management Program, said the courses offered throughout the year help participants prepare for the competition and play a major role in the competitor’s final projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the finalists, Vince Kuppamala of Collatera and Dylan Rodriguez of PhantaField, are graduate students getting their Master’s degree through this program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuppamala said the professors in the program are from the top business schools in the U.S., providing the eager students with experienced mentors to learn from.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think there’s another program like it in the country,” Kuppamala said. “You can get such a great integrated business and technology education.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/","id":2378,"author":{"id":105,"name":"Jack Hu"},"related":[2377,2376,2375],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legacies Not Lost: Memorial Scholarships Carry on Dreams of I.V.

Throughout Winter Quarter and part of Spring Quarter, the teams have been taking the first few steps on their business models and have been receiving entrepreneurship education in TMP seminars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this preparation will reach its final culmination on Wednesday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/startup-competition-finalists-to-square-off-on-wednesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/startup-competition-finalists-to-square-off-on-wednesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/startup-competition-finalists-to-square-off-on-wednesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/startup-competition-finalists-to-square-off-on-wednesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/startup-competition-finalists-to-square-off-on-wednesday/","id":2375,"author":{"id":105,"name":"Jack Hu"},"related":[2374,2373,2372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Elections Board, Students Discuss Election Safety, Sustainability, More","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-Elections-2017-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-Elections-2017-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Elections Board (ASEB) held a post-election town hall at Pardall Center Friday evening where around 15 students gathered to discuss the various issues that arose during this ye...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board (ASEB) held a post-election town hall at Pardall Center Friday evening where around 15 students gathered to discuss the various issues that arose during this year’s election in hopes of improving the overall election experience next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Director of Legislative Accountability Steven Kwok facilitated the discussion, which focused heavily on improving candidate safety as competition during elections runs strong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate Justice Dumlao was injured in a bike accident while trying to find the best place for his campaign board the Sunday before active campaign began. As a tradition, candidates gather at Pardall Tunnel on Sunday then race across campus to distribute campaign material.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, third-year biology major and transfer senator-elect, proposed a “lottery system” for assigning spots, which he said will eliminate the need for a race and increase the physical safety of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student suggested that the boards move from the bike path to the front of the library to avoid the battle of best placement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue discussed at the meeting was the structure and timeline of the election cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After discussion, the ASEB decided active campaigning would move to Week Two of Spring Quarter in order to allow candidates and other students involved in the election process to concentrate on their midterms. This means that elections season would end during Week Three of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates also faced problems surrounding the rules of the declaration of candidacy. Media outlets such as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported on the students’ candidacy soon after the declaration deadline at the end of Winter Quarter, but the candidates were not allowed to officially comment on their intent to run until Week Four of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s like after declaration of candidacy you can’t acknowledge your own candidacy, which doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Kristin Hsu, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third-year political science major and external vice president for statewide affairs-elect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students expressed concern over the environmental implications of the campaigning boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amy Koo, a second-year political science major, said reducing the number of boards for each party could reduce waste and encourage candidates to use other methods of campaigning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we are moving towards a waste-free UCSB, then that’s something that can be restricted,” Koo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting attendees agreed that the ASEB must be more involved in the campaigning process to reduce party harassment and hostility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hate the fact that we are all friends, and yet for two weeks we hate each other,” Koo said. “[It’s] just not a good system, and it just breeds a lot of hostility, and it makes us less likely to work with each other in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kwok said the tense political climate results from the “atmosphere” created between parties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t have to be as hostile as it is,” Kwok said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

In April, both Luan and Hu leed UCSB’s Go Club to a championship victory in the last round of the Collegiate Go League. Hu is set to be president of the small but successful club next year. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Facing off against each other, Rex Luan and Stephen Hu, current and future president of UC Santa Barbara’s Go Club, sit in perfect contrast.</p>\n<p>Playing with white stones and clad in black, Luan sits quietly and seriously, contemplating his next move. Wearing a patterned shirt and a Go tie, his partner looks at me and grins.</p>\n<p>“When Rex gets into the game, his face gets red. The redder he is, the better he plays,” Hu says.</p>\n<p>Though small in numbers, UCSB Go Club makes up for it with heart.</p>\n<p>Luan was only six years old when he was first exposed to Go, and for him it was love at first sight. He began spending four hours a week in lessons with a professional player, reviewing games and practicing with fellow students.</p>\n<p>It was this dedication that led the Go Club to victory this April.</p>\n<p>Along with club member Justin Shieh, Hu and Luan made up the team that narrowly defeated the University of Toronto and claimed victory in the final round of the Collegiate Go League.</p>\n<p>Both Shieh and Hu have similar origin stories. Hu was first introduced to Go when he was four. He said an elderly cook at his kindergarten in Beijing was the first to teach him the game, and he then began playing with his father.</p>\n<p>Shieh, who was first exposed to the game in Mandarin school at the age of eight, said he fell into it almost “by accident.” He said he started playing around the age of nine or ten and played seriously for nine years.</p>\n<p>Go originated in ancient China, and, according to the club members, is easy to learn but difficult to master. Although the game may seem simple, with a wooden board and black and white pieces, its appearance is deceiving.</p>\n<p>According to the American Go Association, it is “the most complex of all games.”</p>\n<p>Google recently developed an artificial intelligence system called AlphaGo that was able to beat one of the top ranked Go players. In two weeks, it will take on the highest ranked Go player in the world, Ke Jie.</p>\n<p>Not only has AlphaGo made a splash in the international Go community, but it has also inspired Luan, a computer engineering major, to share his love of the game and continue learning about the mathematics behind it.</p>\n<p>“I want to spread this culture to other places in UCSB and introduce it to more people,” Luan said. “Go itself contains a lot of wisdom. Many people try to break it, break its algorithm … I tried to attempt to break its algorithm, too … but I’m still studying for it.”</p>\n<h6><center><img data-attachment-id=\"77809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/playful-wisdom-go-club-and-its-quiet-success/howtoplaygo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=999%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,670\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"howtoplaygo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=888%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-77809\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=700%2C469\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></center></h6>\n<p>Beyond algorithms, Go also inspires passion within the club members.</p>\n<p>Shieh said his demanding work schedule often prevents him from attending meetings and limits his ability to practice, but he still plays with the Go Club because of the team’s friendship.</p>\n<p>For others, the love of the game extends past the fun and competition and relates back to real life.</p>\n<p>“I just think that Go has so many parallels to life; it has many metaphors,” Hu said. “In the global sense, you have to give up something, and this relates to life. You have to give up maybe what’s less important in the moment and just focus on what’s larger. And it hurts to give up things, it really does, but sometimes you have to.”</p>\n<p>This love and fascination with Go manifests through continued practice. Hu plays one game a day, averaging around an hour and a half per game.</p>\n<p>Despite the time commitment and preparation for competition, however, the road to victory was riddled with challenges.</p>\n<p>The team is split into different “boards,” with the strongest player playing the first board. For Hu, this posed significant challenges due to the high skill level of players from other schools.</p>\n<p>When competing against UC Berkeley, Hu said he faced off against a professional player, which proved to be an intimidating task.</p>\n<p>“With Go, there’s no luck; if you lose, that means you have certainly done something wrong,” Hu said. “You just played unfavorably compared to your opponent … I didn’t feel too bad because I was playing a pro, and I don’t spend all day playing this game.”</p>\n<p>“But then again, I really felt during those weeks it was comradery and team spirit that really carried us through,” Hu added, showing the club’s sense of togetherness that has developed through days of practice.</p>\n<p>Described by Hu as a “dark horse,” UCSB’s Go Club was not expected to win the competition. It ranked fifth after the normal season, but after a months-long campaign that began in October, a narrow victory by Shieh clinched their two-to-one victory over University of Toronto.</p>\n<p>“It came down to the last move,” Hu said. “I felt surprisingly calm after that. I wasn’t, like, too ecstatic. The previous night, I thought that if we won this I would like erupt with a cheer, but I didn’t. I guess, at the moment, I just couldn’t take the enormity of that.”</p>\n<p>With Shieh and Luan graduating after this quarter, the future of Go Club remains uncertain. With fewer than 10 members regularly attending meetings, forming a team remains a challenge.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a popular game by any means,” Shieh said.</p>\n<p>Yet poised to take over as president, Hu said he is not worried about the amount of members the team will have in the future or protecting its title.</p>\n<p>“With every club, people graduate, people come and go … including myself,” Hu said. “If we win it next year or have a good result next time, then it’s going to feel good. But the first chance we got is really the most memorable one, and we seized it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate voted against the divestment resolution, 0-16. Seven abstained. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Many Jewish students who spoke at the public comment portion called the resolution anti-Semitic, saying that divestment from the nation state of Israel personally affects Jewish students on campus.</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the resolution presents an anti-Semitic rhetoric and is a “denial of the Jewish right to self-determination.”</p>\n<p>“This language is no more than a clever disguise to achieve a much more sinister agenda,” Erez said during public forum. “This is a direct attack on the one Jewish state in the world.”</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, fourth-year sociology and film double major, said the BDS and SJP movements have presented a “misleading portrayal” of the Israel-Palestine conflict and have normalized anti-Semitism on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“I have never felt so unsafe and unwelcome on campus than I do during the BDS campaign,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Other students reject the argument that divestment from Israel is an attack on religious or ethnic Jews.They defend the resolution saying that divestment maintains the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus.”</p>\n<p>— Aaron Hendizadeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menelik Dagnachew, a third-year English major, said he supports divestment as an Ethiopian American because he believes the oppression of Palestinians is similar to the oppression of Ethiopian people.</p>\n<p>“My heart bleeds for Palestinian people,” he said. “It makes me mad so that I’m shaking right now. As much as this is a cultural issue … this is not an issue we should be directly tied to.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Klein, a second-year history major and Jewish student, spoke in favor of the resolution and objected to the alleged victimization of the Jewish ethnic minority.</p>\n<p>“Just because you’re a minority does not give you the right to violate human rights,” he said.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, the chief financial officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, said he is opposed to divestment because he believes the investment in the companies is beneficial for students and the university.</p>\n<p>“In terms of fiscal responsibility, these investments bring a lot back to UCSB students,” Torbati said.</p>\n<p>Other speakers at public forum in support of the resolution cited historical events, such as the United States Civil Rights movement and the South African apartheid, as similar to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>Steven Kwok, the A.S. director of legislative accountability, urged the senate to vote through a roll call vote “in the interest of transparency.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The public forum ended at approximately 2 a.m. and the Senate then heard statements from the resolution’s sponsors, Kaur and Tessema. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During deliberation, some senators echoed the opinions of students who spoke earlier saying the resolution was an anti-Semitic gesture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Aaron Hendizadeh said that if this resolution was solely about divestment from U.S. companies, then the drafters would not have needed to include the companies’ partnerships with Israel in the resolution text. He said he believes the resolution singles out Israel for this reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Senator Hannah Ellenhorn said the resolution ignores the cultural and religious identities of Jewish students on campus and marginalizes the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Only a minority of a community can define what hatred is against that community,” she said. “You cannot tell the Jewish community that this is not an attack on their identity.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other senators defended the resolution, insisting as students did earlier in the night that divestment from Israel is about asserting the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Jonathan Lopez said the resolution does not question whether or not the state of Israel has a right to exist; rather, he said it is about withdrawing UC investments from alleged human rights violations in the Middle East.</span></p>\n<p>“We cannot be complicit in these acts anymore,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, who served as a proxy for Senator Lesly Silva, said he is in solidarity with the Palestinian people as a member of Queer Commission and said he understands the feeling of being oppressed in society.</span></p>\n<div class=\"infogram-embed\" data-id=\"senator_divestment_votes\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Senator Divestment

Tuesday, increasing tension between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel student groups days before a divestment resolution goes before Associated Students Senate today.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Students Supporting Israel, an international movement in support of the Jewish-Democratic state of Israel, created the sign with the support of Santa Barbara Hillel and Artists 4 Israel last week during “Israel Peace Week.” They installed the sign on May 4.</p>\n<p>The sign displays the word “Israel” in large block letters. Defacers spray painted the words “Free Palestine” across the front of it.</p>\n<p>Artists 4 Israel, an artist organization in support of Israel, began fixing the defaced sign Tuesday afternoon, adding the words “stop hate” across its entire surface.</p>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) proposed a resolution on April 23, urging A.S. to divest from companies that “occupy” Palestine territories. The A.S. Senate will vote on the resolution during tonight’s meeting in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>SJP specifically asks that UCSB and the UC Regents divest from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, although the group is asking the UC to divest from all companies that contribute to humans rights abuses in Palestine.</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. is the only UC government that has not passed a divestment resolution in recent years.</p>\n<p>SJP released a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday morning “firmly and unequivocally” condemning the acts of vandalism and the accusations that SJP was affiliated with the incident.</p>\n<p>“Our group was in no way involved in this incident, and denounces vandalism of any student group’s displays,” the statement reads. “It would be foolish and inflammatory to lay blame upon this SJP for acts perpetrated by those who are not involved in our organization and act independently from us.”</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, the president of Students Supporting Israel and a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said he is not surprised the sign was defaced because “Free Palestine” was already written on the sign Friday in Sharpie.</p>\n<div

personally worked so hard to get these artists up here to create something positive for not only our community, but what we felt was the entire UCSB community,” Erez said.</p>\n<p>According to Erez, Artists 4 Israel wrote words such as “love” and “peace” in Arabic, Hebrew and English across the front of the sign and allowed student groups to write messages of love and unity on the back.</p>\n<p>UCSB student Jewish groups released a unity statement Monday in opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), a group supporting divestment from Israel.</p>\n<p>Erez said BDS “brings out anti-Semitism” on campuses across the nation and said divestment resolutions are “discriminatory” toward Jewish students and the religion.</p>\n<p>He said such resolutions and groups “single out” one side of the complex conflict between Israel and Palestine and place blame “solely and squarely on Israel.”</p>\n<p>“I believe you can be pro-Israel and pro-Palestine and pro-peace all at the same time,” Erez added. “And we should invest in peace, not boycott one side or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the fourth time Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has introduced such a resolution. The most recent attempt occurred in 2015, when the bill </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-resolution-falls-two-votes-short-of-passing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to pass</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with then-Internal Vice President Angela Lau casting the tie-breaking “no” vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Jonathan Lopez and Unique Vance will first introduce the resolution; afterward, student sponsors Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema will have a chance to speak. The public will then be able to discuss their own opinions on the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Jones, the A.S. assistant director for community affairs, student engagement and advocacy, said these hearings have been widely attended by students in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even for a spectator observing the dynamics of the room itself, [it’s] very polarizing. One half of the room has one particular position, the other half of the room has an opposing position,” Jones said. “These meetings are well attended such that they often have to be moved to Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of people that show up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student group Students for Justice in Palestine </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first released the resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the public on April 24. Since then, the resolution has been endorsed by 36 student organizations on campus including the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed, the resolution will prompt A.S. to divest from companies such as Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard. According to the bill, these corporations have provided Israel with military aid in attacks on Gaza.</span></p>\n<p>SJP acknowledged that A.S. UCSB does not hold any investments in these companies, but they hope the bill will spur A.S. to take an active role in advocating for the UC to divest.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, eight Jewish student organizations published a joint statement opposing the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel for the Palestinians and Israelis, and we work actively to promote speakers and projects that help bring both sides together toward a peaceful solution,” the statement read. “We, the Jewish student leaders of UCSB, are united in rejecting this one sided, counterproductive, and incredibly hurtful BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] resolution.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of both sides hope students come out for the meeting. Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said attending the meeting is relevant for UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Folks don’t have to make a statement; folks don’t have to stay the whole time, but coming out is important,” she said. “This is the money of every single student on this campus, and so this pertains to every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talia Karu, a third-year biopsychology major and the president of the student board at Santa Barbara Hillel, is planning to attend the meeting in opposition to the resolution. She said she hopes that students who attend the meeting will try to understand both perspectives of the topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything you’re going to hear about this issue is going to be biased, one side or another,” she said. “If you do go, try and take everything with a grain of salt, and try to understand that it’s a very personal issue … [It’s important] to keep that in mind and to respect both sides of the matter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77740\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77740\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/","id":2740,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[2739,2738,2737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Advocating for Fossil Fuel Divestment Stage Sit-in, Meet With Chancellor Yang","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1138.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1138.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After hosting a sit-in at Cheadle Hall for almost 36 hours, student leaders are currently meeting with Chancellor Henry T.

Fossil Free UCSB coordinators Theo LeQuesne and Claire Wilson started their meeting with Yang at approximately 3 p.m. Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB says the chancellor already “embraces the campaign,” according to a press release Monday, but organizers hope that Tuesday’s meeting will spur Yang to take a more active role.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that, with his public acknowledgement of support for our campaign, that will have a rolling effect with other chancellors across the UC campuses so that they will also step up and commit to divesting away from fossil fuels,” Celeste Argueta, a Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil fuel activists at UC Berkeley staged a similar sit-in just two weeks ago, during which over 20 students sat in Sproul Hall for almost 10 hours until UCPD asked them to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis chapter of Fossil Free UC also hosted a sit-in last week on their campus. Student activists initially planned to demonstrate in Mrak Hall during business hours but opted instead to stay the night after being asked by administration to vacate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the most successful sit-ins have divested from fossil fuels, so why can’t we?” Macy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB organizers plan to remain in Cheadle Hall until Thursday. UC Regents will be holding one of their bimonthly meetings in Berkeley next week, during which they look to discuss the status of their investments.</span></p><div

The two-year success of CU is similar to that of the Open People’s Party, a former A.S. political party that took the majority of positions for two consecutive years in 2013 to 2014.</p>\n<p>According to CU party co-chairs Madison Hechler and Izabella Kipnis, the party campaigned for the election through reaching out to groups in the Office of Student Life (OSL), tabling on campus and going door-to-door in Isla Vista explaining the CU platform.</p>\n<p>CU candidates were taught how to campaign in I.V., which included training on how the candidates should conduct themselves in any situation that could occur when visiting I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“For the party as a whole, knocking on doors was the most effective way to reach out to people,” Kipnis said.</p>\n<p>Hechler and Kipnis both said the CU party has a family dynamic that allowed the party to bond and work collectively on the campaign.</p>\n<p>“I would start by saying that our name isn’t just a name; we really are a united party,” Kipnis said. “We made an effort so that all our candidates got to know each other and all the campaign managers bonded and were close.”</p>\n<p>“I think that we are a super, super diverse party, and we like to bring in people from different aspects of campus and walks of life,” Hechler added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77440\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77440\" data-attachment-id=\"77440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/dsc_4980/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=2048%2C1214&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1214\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_4980\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=888%2C526&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980-1024x607.jpg?resize=888%2C526\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristin Hsu (center) thanked her mentor Matthew Santos (left) for her election as external vice president of statewide affairs on Thursday. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hechler joined CU last year and worked as a campaign manager for the election.

id=\"caption-attachment-77389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alicia Garza, cofounder of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, speaks at Campbell Hall on Wednesday night.<em> Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza, a UC San Diego alum, last came to UCSB nearly 10 years ago when she worked for the University of California Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting the tone for an intersectional conversation about social justice, Garza welcomed the full auditorium by asking the audience to acknowledge that they were standing on land once occupied by Chumash indigenous people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then expressed her support for the list of demands from the Black Student Union, Black Student Engagement program and Black Resource Committee, which includes ensuring that black students make up more than 5 percent of the university’s student population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also supported the idea to hire two full-time black psychologists on campus and spoke of the psychological effects of controversial speakers invited to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Emotional wellness is important for everybody, not just black students,” she said, “but certainly in a campus environment, where I hear there was just a speaker here talking about the lies and division of Black Lives Matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro spoke at Campbell Hall in February for his event titled “Lies, Prejudice, and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement,” which was later named “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said narratives of history impact our present and future. She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
