As a student, your interests are at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats vice president of events and fourth-year geology major Sam Goldman said although the university’s position as the number one university for voter registration is commendable, the achievement can be misleading.</p>\n<p>“You want to make sure that voter registration turns into actual voting,” Goldman said. “It is obviously really awesome, and it does reflect a campus that is active and concerned with what’s going on around us. But hopefully the momentum from this event will get people excited and will carry over to election day.”<br>\nCapps said that students have a significant impact on the outcome of her race.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concentration of votes that I appreciate for my race because this race is really a tough one and so it might give me the margin of victory,” Capps said. “My husband won a congressional seat and he won by the margin of the number of students who voted in Isla Vista and at UCSB. I always try to share that with students about the importance of student votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, students play a large role in deciding whether or not future cyclic steam injection, acidizing or fracking will occur in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara is regarded in many places as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and that is an important legacy,” Williams said. “We had hundreds of applications in the last year [for drilling new wells] and many would be with the most dangerous, the most water intensive and the highest carbon emissions of techniques that are out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Campus Democrats President and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond, as election day grows closer Campus Democrats will continue to promote the importance of voting to students and Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>For the “I’ve got a big clock counting down in my head ‘til election day,” Hammond said. “We’re going to be knocking on doors, calling people, going around the neighborhood, waving signs at people; basically everything you possibly can to get people to come out.”</p>\n<p>Newsom said he believes Campus Democrats’ efforts are important to help “reconcile the apathy that exists with young folks in the electoral process at all levels.”</p>\n<p>“We have an obligation to be active citizens,” Newsom said. “Young folks have the capacity to amplify their voices in a way that is unique in this generation. There are a lot of young folks that have the absolute ability to change things radically, but only if they exercise their voice and are more participatory in the life of their campus.”</p>\n<p>A

Reul, discussed their respective agendas for this year’s special election on Tuesday at a public forum at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The Student Advocate General is an Associated Students executive officer and acts as a public defender for the students under university policy. The special election comes after third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected to the SAG position last Spring, abdicated the position because of personal medical issues.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim and Reul addressed issues such as student outreach and the efficiency and productivity of the SAG office.  When asked about the role of the SAG, the candidates stressed different parts of the job, with Ibrahim emphasizing the role of assistance that SAG provides for students.</p>\n<p>“The job of the Student Advocate General is to facilitate communication between the students and the university,” Ibrahim said. “If a student is in trouble for cheating or dealing with harassment, our job is to advise them on what to do. The student advocacy general should be a resource that is always available for students to advise them on whatever issue that they may be having,” Ibrahim said.</p>\n<p>Reul said the SAG should serve as a direct link between students and the university, advocating for students to university administration.</p>\n<p>“We are the only office in the executive that directly deals with the students,” Reul said. “The role of the Student Advocate General is to not only amplify the voice of the students, but also to give them resources to assist themselves.”</p>\n<p>When asked about informing students regarding the Office of the Student Advocate, both candidates agreed on hosting more events to educate students about the office.</p>\n<p>Reul said he plans on continuing the outreach program that Loverin began last year in addition to the casework department.</p>\n<p>“We are going to hire more casework staff to enhance the outreach output,” Reul said. “We are going to host regular events in I.V. and in residence halls to tell people about SAG.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said he also supported the outreach program and discussed other ways to reach out to students.</p>\n<p>“I will let students know that this resource is available to them,” Ibrahim said. “I will definitely utilize Facebook as a platform to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates said events in Isla Vista, such as Deltopia and Halloween, have gotten out of hand. Both candidates also discussed the role of on-campus events to deter students from going to I.V., but each are looking for different ways to do so.</p>\n<p>“With everything that has happened last year, these events have become really unsafe,” Ibrahim said. “Whether it is from the presence of people from out of town or the increased police presence that has made people feel uncomfortable. We really need to focus on keeping it local and safe.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said she supported events such as the upcoming concert on Friday, because of their potential to reduce student participation in the Halloween festivities.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Residence Hall Association, Reul emphasized the role that RHA can play during these events.</p>\n<p>“I feel that these events have gotten unwieldy,” Reul said. “We can provide alternatives to these events. RHA does hold events that are not only for the residence hall members but also for the community at large. We can make these events fun and also safe.”</p>\n<p>However, the candidates disagreed on how they would increase the efficiency of the SAG.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said measures should be put in place to ensure a more productive working environment.</p>\n<p>“There should be a reapplication process to make sure there is a really good work dynamic,” Ibrahim said. “I honestly feel that a good work dynamic can help increase efficiency. Also, assigning very specific duties to the staff because all of the duties are broad.”</p>\n<p>Reul also said he will seek to increase productivity by allowing students new ways to submit their cases.</p>\n<p>“We intend to increase efficiency by reinventing our website to make sure that cases can be submitted online with near-instant response,” Reul said. “We are going to have office hours in residence halls.”</p>\n<p>In their closing statements, Reul reiterated his experience in the OSA, while Ibrahim emphasized her association with numerous organizations on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Map courtesy of <em>sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>On Monday, the university announced that alumna Linda Duttenhaver donated $2 million towards the restoration of a 1950s ranch house on Sedgwick Reserve which accommodates affiliated researchers from half of the approximately 40 projects on the reserve.</p>\n<p>The donation will go towards bringing the Sedgwick ranch house up-to-date with fire and building codes, followed by renovating the facility to make it more comfortable and functional for residents. The Sedgwick Reserve is located 40 miles north of campus in the Santa Ynez Valley and is one of seven reserves managed by the university’s Natural Reserve System (NRS), a branch of the greater UC Natural Reserve System which oversees 39 reserves in total throughout the state.</p>\n<p>According to Sedgwick Reserve Resident Director Kate McCurdy, the money may be used to update specific parts of the house.</p>\n<p>“We hope to modernize the really funky old 1950s kitchen, to make it useful for people to cook,” McCurdy said. “Right now the house is set up in a dorm style with lots of bunk beds so we’re also going to replace the bunk beds with double beds.”</p>\n<p>Patricia Holden, professor of environmental microbiology in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and director of the Natural Reserve System, said the mission of the UC NRS is to “support broadly university level research, education and public outreach.”</p>\n<p>According to Holden, all UC NRS projects are “approached with the lens of sustainability,” and make energy and water conservation an important criteria throughout the design process.</p>\n<p>“We currently produce our own energy here with solar panels,” McCurdy said. “Now we want to replace the windows and possibly do rainwater capture off the roof, and also replace the heating system so it is more energy efficient.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy said Duttenhaver is “one of those rare gem alumni,” who has made significant contributions to Sedgwick Reserve over the last few years.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to her to see students use what they’re learning in the classroom out in the field,” McCurdy said. “She definitely recognizes that having a decent place to stay when you’re out on the edge of wilderness is very important. For students and faculty to really be inspired by the place they’re working at, they need to be comfortable and safe.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said some of Duttenhaver’s past donations have aided the renovation of the ranch’s historic barn, as well as the development of an outreach program.</p>\n<p>“That barn was so close to falling over and it was pretty scary to be in there on a windy day because you could see the whole thing moving,” McCurdy said. “So she really did save that from the brink of collapse. Then our outreach program allows us to have public hikes and a lecture series. So without her help it would be pretty quiet out here.”</p>\n<p>NRS Business Officer Donna Moore said the NRS provides researchers and students a protected environment for their studies.</p>\n<p>“Researchers can come and set up an experiment or classes can come and get involved in a project and they know that it won’t be disturbed,” said Moore. “It also protects the area, keeping them as restored to their original condition as they could possibly be, and gives researchers a place to stay and keep their equipment.”</p>\n<p>Various research efforts are pursued at the reserve within fields including botany, archaeology, microbiology and geology. According to McCurdy, native plants and animals thrive in an undisturbed habitat. Additionally, a telescope is also being used at the Sedgwick Reserve by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Network, a nonprofit network of robotic telescopes used for science and education.</p>\n<p>“We are sort of at the southern end of the Transverse Range and we have a unique soil type that is high in turpentine that invasive plants don’t do very well in, so we have a lot of native plants that aren’t found elsewhere,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said a grant has been submitted to gain funding for the construction of a 24-bed dormitory adjacent to the ranch house, with a groundbreaking set for 2016.</p>\n<p>“Classes will then be able to use the dorm and researchers and people who are staying longer will be able to use the ranch house,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>According to McCurdy, Sedgwick Reserve is “a little national park” and a place where “you will never know what you’re going to encounter.” McCurdy also said the reserve offers visitors many surprises and a natural habitat worth protecting.</p>\n<p>“What amazes me about this property is how enormous and rich it is,” McCurdy said. “You can see deer and bears and eagles, or you may see animal tracks or a freshly killed deer that a mountain lion just killed. So there’s evidence of just how biologically important this place is. This really is the perfect place to have a reserve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures</h4>\n<p>Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of <em>Moneyball, The Blind Side</em> and <em>Flash Boys,</em> came to the Granada Theatre Tuesday night to speak about his experience as a financial journalist, storyteller and self-proclaimed sloth.</p>\n<p>Hosted by Arts &amp; Lectures, NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton moderated the evening, beginning with an interview portion and allowing time at the end for an audience question and answer session.</p>\n<p>Lewis said he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Art History and went on to the London School of Economics to graduate with a degree in Economics.</p>\n<p>“I was very, very lucky in that before I entered University, my father told me to find and study what I loved,” Lewis said. “In exchange he would give me a three-year buffer after I left school in which he would pay for my living expenses and education.”</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, the offer from his father was instrumental for his career.</p>\n<p>“It was during this time that I discovered I wanted to be a writer, and shortly after that I discovered I had to do something to make up for my Art History degree,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Lewis included anecdotes from his childhood in Louisiana, describing the environment of New Orleans by quoting the family motto his father once told him.</p>\n<p>“Do as little as possible, for it is better to receive a slight reprimand than perform an arduous task,” Lewis said. “A very large part of my life is dedicated to avoiding unpleasant chores.”</p>\n<p>Lewis went on to discuss the process that is involved in finding a story and putting it on paper and how the story of <em>The Blind Side</em> came to be, beginning with how he discovered it.</p>\n<p>“I went to visit a friend of mine from high school in Memphis one year,” Lewis said. “When I got to his house, there was a six-foot-tall, 350-pound black kid sitting in the living room of a white Republican Evangelical Christian in the most segregated city in America … and no one said anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Lewis continued to describe how the story progressed over the year and how he came to terms with writing a story that eventually turned into a movie about his best friend’s family, as well as his experience working as a writer in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“It was great! Movie people are great, they fear the writer,” Lewis said. “They would solicit my opinion and then completely ignore what I said, they just wanted to make sure I would stay nice. But both ‘Moneyball’ and ‘Blindside’ turned out to be truly good films.”</p>\n<p>Lewis also said it is a highly impersonal process to have a personal work turned into a Hollywood hit.</p>\n<p>“The stupidity in Hollywood is not at the level of actors, writers and directors,” Lewis said. “There’s some truly beautiful storytelling that happens there. The stupidity in Hollywood lies in the business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Lewis concluded the discussion by answering audience questions and touching on what it means to be a good writer.</p>\n<p>“People who are really good storytellers tend to have very distinctive voices on the page, people are afraid of their individuality and once they start mimicking their favorite writers, their value is gone,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, his future plans include writing a book about U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>“He has really let me into his life like no other journalist, and if I’m able to write this book the way I want, six months after the end of his presidency people will want nothing more than to read a book about Obama,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Glinton said she enjoyed meeting Lewis, whom he admires for his rare talent.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of those weird things when you’re meeting someone who you’ve known and followed and then you meet them and realize you don’t have to be scared about it,” Glinton said. “He’s a natural storyteller, and genuine, real, accomplished storytellers are few and far between. He’s one of the masters right now.”</p>\n<p>Glinton also said he thought Lewis’ advice would be of practical use to students.</p>\n<p>“Something he said to the student about doing what you like really stuck with me also, it’s ridiculous to tell someone to follow their dreams,” Glinton said. “But students should really be in pursuit of what they like to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Arts &amp; Lectures student manager for the event Lauren Cassis agreed and said she enjoyed his discussion about his books and his time as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was very insightful and I liked how his conversation was very broad in the topics,” Cassis said. “Hearing about ‘The Blind Side,’ how the story came together, was very interesting.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article used the pronoun “she” when referencing to Sonari Glinton, when in actuality the article should have used “he”.]</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.</p>\n<p>The fair, which happens every quarter, features a slew of national companies such as Yelp, Target, Microsoft, SolarCity and Oracle, along with local companies such as Raytheon and AppFolio. Although the event is free for all students, alumni are welcome with a nominal fee paid two days in advance.</p>\n<p>According to Career Services counselor Molly Steen, the fair usually attracts a turnout of about 600 to 800 students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good number of students that come through and take advantage of this,” Steen said.</p>\n<p>Annie Phung, a fourth-year communication major and member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, one of the fair sponsors, said her organization has been busy trying to promote the event by passing out flyers, posters and making announcements. She said the fair is a good opportunity not only to come into contact with potential employers, but to gain employment-seeking skills.</p>\n<p>“You just come and talk to people,” Phung said. “It is also good practice for them to look professional; to communicate on a casual, yet professional level with employers face-to-face.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Feria, a fourth-year sociology and Spanish double major and member of Teach for America, said she is excited be on the other side of job hunt, helping students get career experience.</p>\n<p>“There is so much potential in all these students, and the fact that I was on the other side last year and I’m helping them now is so amazing,” Feria said. “You can tell the difference between somebody who takes the initiative to bring a resume, somebody who takes the initiative to have everything clean and somebody who takes the initiative to really stand out is really great.”</p>\n<p>Alumna Kristie Reynolds, who represented Macy’s, said there are certain steps students can do to improve their chances of landing a job.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared,” Reynolds said. “Definitely look up all the companies that are going to be at the career fair that you’re interested in. I think you need to know what positions that they have available … and know what you want to go into and be prepared with the experience that you have and how to sell yourself at the career fair.”</p>\n<p>Electrical engineering major Daren Jing said he focused on writing a good resume to get an internship for electrical or computer engineering. He said the career fair makes the job search easily accessible for all students.</p>\n<p>“This [is] good because I can talk to those people, those employees and learn more about their company,” Jing said. “I don’t need to go online and search [for] each company. It takes a lot of time, but here, I can talk to each [person] and hand out my resume.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds said students will learn about the career options they’ll have during and after college.</p>\n<p>“I hope that they’ll get good experience in learning how to network and find out what’s out there for them and how UCSB can really help them develop their careers after college,” she said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 14 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/","id":2986,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2985,2984,2983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night to discuss new amendments and bills regarding the recording of Senate meetings, the upcoming Student of Color Conference and capabilities to remove A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau began the discussion by addressing the current bills in question and moved the conversation to Senate member inquiries before allowing time for public forum.</p>\n<p>Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, gave an update prior to public forum about an ongoing housing shortage for international students.</p>\n<p>“We’re currently trying to work with them to find out how many have and don’t have housing at the moment,” O’Brien said. “What I’ve been told is that, for whatever reason, the housing market has been impacted and that it was an unexpected thing. The school isn’t overenrolled, the students are just having difficulty finding housing.”</p>\n<p>After public forum, a motion was introduced to permit the videotaping of Senate meetings in order to have them available for public viewing. The motion was voted on and then sent to the Constitution and Bylaws Committee for further consideration.</p>\n<p>Diversity Educator for the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) Kyron Covington requested Senate funding for the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to take place on Nov. 7 to 9 at UC Merced. Covington said the conference was a chance for students of color to discuss issues relevant to “color culture” and their specific universities.</p>\n<p>“It is a chance to celebrate students of color culture and talk about issues that they can bring back to their respective campuses,” Covington said.</p>\n<p>Senator Liam Stanton also requested A.S. President Ali Guthy to fund the Student of Color Conference with presidential funds. Guthy said an examination of the budget was necessary before any funds could be appropriated.</p>\n<p>Third-year literature major and former Student Advocate General Bailey Loverin also sponsored an update to A.S. Legal Code Article VII Sections 3 and 8-10, with the intent of preventing what she alleged was the unjust removal of A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“[The bill] does not allow executives to remove appointed officers without consent of the Senate,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez brought up issues of student health and the possibility of establishing “peace zones” in the school to aid students dealing with various stages of post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p>“The administration and the Chancellor are working together to develop peaceful areas in the school for students to be able to relax,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>Senate questions were addressed towards the end of the meeting, with Lau encouraging Senators to spread news of the upcoming special A.S. Election for Student Advocate General and External Vice President of Local Affairs in order to gain results reflective of the entire student body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Eligibility also requires fulfillment of at least six units while maintaining a 2.0 overall grade point average. An information session for interested individuals will be held at the A.S. Pardall Center today from 12-1 p.m. on Pardall Road in Isla Vista. Deadline candidacy forms were also made available online yesterday.</p>\n<p>Proposed plebiscites, new fees, referendums or fee increases can be submitted to the “fee intent form” found on the elections website and sent to elections@as.ucsb.edu by tomorrow, Oct. 15, at 4 p.m. In addition, pro/con statements will be due to the Elections Committee by Oct. 22 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active campaigning for the Special Election will start Oct. 26 at 8 p.m. According to the announcement, the timeline is more condensed than that of the last year’s Spring general election and “diligence” with regard to deadlines and dates is mandated by the elections committee. The last time a special election was held on the UCSB campus was in 2006.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article has been updated to reflect the date and time of the info sessions occurring today, from 12-1 pm, for prospective candidates.]</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56860\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56860\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/","id":2984,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2983,2982,2981],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

These are UC officers from other UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Olson answered questions from Senators regarding police policy towards people suspected of underage drinking.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild asked if students were required to present identification to officers when on their own driveways and property. Olson responded by saying that students were not obligated to do so and would not be arrested if officers couldn’t prove that they were under age.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going tell you that you have to,” Olson said, “they’re not going to arrest you for being underage unless they know you’re underage.”</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD was not looking to make students miserable or refrain from doing anything fun, but rather to simply behave in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p>“I’m not here to tell you that I don’t want you to have fun or do things that UCSB and college affords you to do, that’s just not right,” Olson said. “What we want you to do is be safe and make good decisions and be part of that success. I hope you know that and feel that when you see us out there … we’re not here to make your lives hard.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, members of the UCSB Cotillion Dance Club voiced complaints that the Rec Cen had taken action to make their club and its 100 members unable to practice.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Cotillion Dance Club member Letitia Mueller said actions taken by the Rec Cen to raise the price of renting rooms, thus making others unavailable altogether, has forced students to resort to practicing in unsafe locations such as parking lots.</p>\n<p>“This is dangerous. This is a liability,” Mueller said. “People are break-dancing in Lot 22. That’s so scary. People can break their necks, and it’s not okay. We need resource creation. We need a space to practice. There are no spaces for independent dance groups.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a push to change Associated Student Senate’s election system, plans to improve mental health services at UCSB and successful voter registration drives on campus.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated that the UCen Governance Board had implemented policies affecting the Cotillion Dance Club. That is incorrect. This department discussed in the Senate meeting was actually the Rec Cen.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 9, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56723\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56723\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/","id":3018,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3017,3016,3015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Spanning two hours, suggestions regarding creating a neighborhood association or a community services district centered Monday’s discussion.</p>\n<p>Since the 1960s, Isla Vista has had difficulty becoming a self-governing entity, failing to pass cityhood attempts three different times in 1973, 1975 and 1984.</p>\n<p>According to Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr, the main issue Isla Vista has with becoming a self-governing entity is finding sustainable funding.</p>\n<p>“We need as much help as we can get from all segments of the community,” Farr said. “It’s really important. I think that we are making strides on infrastructure, but the key baseline issue is sustainable funding.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Isla Vista’s small geographic size and large population density is a challenge towards procuring sustainable funding, Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Traditionally, money comes from property tax, sales tax, [and] bed tax,” Farr said. “Isla Vista doesn’t really have any hotels, so it has no bed tax. It has some sales tax, but not a lot. It’s mainly property tax, but they need to balance that off with the amount of services they need, which is a lot.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista is one of Santa Barbara County’s four pockets of poverty, according to Farr. Because many students and low-income families already struggle to makes ends meet, Farr said it would be unfair to charge them more money.</p>\n<p>Town hall attendee and Isla Vista resident Jeffrey Walsh said that members of all ends of the Isla Vista community need to speak with each other to develop a plan for the future.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of different, diverse members of the population,” Walsh said. “We felt that it was really important that those groups or stakeholders caucused among themselves because they’re not monolithic groups that are all in agreement with each other.”</p>\n<p>While meetings continue to be planned, former A.S. president Jonathan Abboud said choosing a self-governance option too soon could ultimately hurt the community more than help it.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a smart idea to rush into any one option because it could end up being not what we actually need,” Abboud said, “or it could end up being a little useless, or not as effective as we need it to be.”</p>\n<p>As far as a future community center goes, Farr said the former Redevelopment Agency properties on Embarcadero Del Mar could serve as a potential location.</p>\n<p>“We have things now like the former RDA properties that we managed to hang on to that we can use as a place to provide services to start a beginning community center,” Farr said. “In the future, I’d like to see a big capital campaign where we ultimately would build a really big, new, beautiful community center, and knock these other old buildings down, and have something that would really work with the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, town hall meetings such as Monday’s, where “a broad section of the community [was] represented,” are vital for pushing forward the implementation of concrete plans for Isla Vista’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s terrible it’s taken these tragic events of this year and Deltopia, but there’s been so much renewed energy and focus now on Isla Vista that it is all positive,” Farr said. “I think the future is better and looking up, and I think it’s working at a positive direction.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Isla Vista town hall meeting is scheduled for October 7, 2014. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Office of the EVPLA</em></p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The task force will oversee efforts made system-wide to prevent sexual violence and will allow various UC campuses to share effective practices in regard to sexual assault prevention, response and education.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokesperson Dianne Klein, the formation of the task force was not mandated by the policy update, but came directly from Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a serious crime that we will never tolerate,” Napolitano said in a statement. “The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.”</p>\n<p>The task force is comprised of 23 individuals from nine undergraduate campuses and UCOP, — including three UC Regents — and will meet via teleconference every two to three weeks and twice a month in person in July and September. A report regarding the task force will be presented to the Regents during the upcoming July 16-17 meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Ricardo Alcaino, Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, while each UC campus is unique and has different needs to consider when responding to sexual assault, some standardization throughout the UC system is “still feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Having some minimum requirements around education for incoming students, ongoing education throughout a student’s time on any campus, and on-campus advocates for survivors could be some areas where campuses could be held to the same standards,” Alcaino said in an email.</p>\n<p>The task force could also create “meaningful change” if it lead to the establishment of some standardization of guidelines for sexual assault response for students, staff and faculty, according to Alcaino.</p>\n<p>“There simply cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this work,” Alcaino said in an email, “but having resources that campuses can share and use is a reasonable goal for the Task Force.”</p>\n<p>According to Jill Dunlap, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education and Women’s Center programs, UCSB’s GauchoFYI program is a good example of a practice that could be shared with other campuses via the task force.</p>\n<p>“[It] is a stellar example of collaboration among different departments, including the CARE program,” Dunlap said in an email. “We think requiring first-year and transfer students to go through comprehensive, in-person alcohol and sexual violence prevention programming within their first six weeks of school is important.”</p>\n<p>Alcaino also said the collaboration between CARE and the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment has “proven to be an effective model for the [UC] system to emulate.”</p>\n<p>Savannah Badalich, a fourth-year international development studies major at UCLA and one of two undergraduate students on the task force, said despite her excitement over the “freaking amazing” formation of the task force, more student representation is needed.</p>\n<p>“There should be more students,” Badalich said. “I was kind of hoping that there would be one [student representative] from each school … this is a student issue, there should be a student majority on that task force.”</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, third-year literature major and Associated Students Student Advocate General, also said there should be more student involvement with the task force.</p>\n<p>“I’m also concerned about the apparent lack of student feedback on this task force … [four] student voices is not enough here. The UC system has over 200,000 students. You can’t simplify that to [four] representatives,” Loverin said in an email. “I’d like to see at least two reps from each school, preferably representatives nominated by their student body.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the number of student voices on the task force, Klein affirmed that students are represented and said for any task force to be effective it “can’t be too large,” although she could not comment on the how the members of the task force were selected.</p>\n<p>Badalich also said she hopes the task force will recommend additional funding, particularly for mental health resources for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>“What students need are resources, especially mental health resources … that is stuff that requires money,” Badalich said. “That’s sort of the factor. You can say all you want in support of a cause, but if you don’t give money towards it, it doesn’t mean crap. So we’ll see, I hope one of the recommendations will be giving funding.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, June 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article identified Jill Dunlap as the director of the Women’s Center for Sexual and Gender Equality.

The meeting began with a seven-minute moment of silence held in honor of the shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones reported on the successful efforts coordinated by A.S. executive officers to construct a board for students and community members to share thoughts and feelings in light of recent events. Jones said the board has received non-stop participation, particularly after media coverage in Isla Vista has subsided.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really, really beautiful thing,” Jones said. “We spent all day yesterday and today out there. It’s been a constant flow of students [and] community leaders … who are just coming forth, looking at it, participating, adding thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics and accounting major and Internal Vice President Angela Lau said she has been working on several events to help students heal from the recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working nonstop from Saturday on the candlelight vigil, the memorial and other projects of healing on our campus,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh discussed some of the problems that occurred with the UCSB emergency email message system on the Friday night of the shootings. Singh said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown justified the delayed warnings students received that evening as an attempt to maintain peace.</p>\n<p>“He tried to make an excuse, and said something along the lines of ‘There was a safety concern, we didn’t want people to panic,’” Singh said. “To me, speaking personally, this kind of concerns me because this alert system is made for us to be notified for something like this going on.”</p>\n<p>Singh, a third-year political science and film and media double major, said students frequently receive alerts and warnings about relatively unimportant happenings.</p>\n<p>“We get police alerts all the time for smaller stuff, but we don’t get it when something like this happens,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh also said students should make a concerted effort to be aware of issues related to gun legislation.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been happening, just keep an eye on what’s going on with gun law legislations,” Singh said. “I know that’s been really big, especially [Tuesday] with the memorial. Today, Das Williams proposed his legislation and it was on CNN, so keep an eye on it. It’s something that’s relevant to our community.”</p>\n<p>Several different A.S. executive officers made efforts to reach out to senators to provide emotional support. A.S. President Ali Guthy, a third-year sociology and psychology double major, said she appreciated community efforts over the last week and would be available as a resource to senators and students.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s been a really rough week, and the amount of support we’ve been giving each other as a community has really been inspiring,” Guthy said. “I love you all. If you need anything I’m here as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Senators then passed a resolution to formally request that Chancellor Henry T. Yang ask First Lady Michelle Obama to appear at UCSB and speak on the recent tragedy. Senator Jimmy Villarreal, fourth-year communication major, said the first lady could provide support to the Isla Vista community during a difficult time.</p>\n<p>“In light of the most recent events, we need an inspirational speaker,” Villarreal said. “She will not be coming as a political figure, but as first lady of the United States. I like to think that’s like the mom of America. That’s what we need.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, fifth-year biological anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at public forum to condemn newly appointed External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras for lying to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>, citing documented contradictory statements. He said Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies double major, made incorrect statements regarding the legality of a sales tax and subsequently lied about making those statements.</p>\n<p>“Not only is it as bad as they said, not only did they quote her correctly, but it’s worse than they actually quoted her,” Plotke said. “I want you guys to just think before you take what she says as the truth. Just remember that she lied to the <em>Nexus</em>, she lied to me.”</p>\n<p>On former Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s request, Lau asked Plotke to leave for the remaining duration of the meeting, to which Plotke obliged.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed included debate over Senate approval of staff positions for A.S. executives, planned study jams this evening at the A.S. Annex that will provide free food for students, a bill to create a commemorative memorial plaque for the victims of the shooting and the unanimous passage of a resolution to encourage more socially responsible investments by the UC, which had previously been passed unanimously by the outgoing Senate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/","id":3016,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3015,3014,3013],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Safe & Sound: Isla Vista Plans to Improve Public Safety","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Public Safety Commission held a public safety meeting in Isla Vista Theater yesterday where attendees discussed ways to improve safety and quality of life in Isla Vista.  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Public Safety Commission held a public safety meeting in Isla Vista Theater yesterday where attendees discussed ways to improve safety and quality of life in Isla Vista.<br>\nA.S. Public Safety Commission Chairperson and third-year biology major Molly Morrison organized the event in hopes of bringing Isla Vista residents together to brainstorm ideas to enact safety reform in I.V. The students who spoke at yesterday’s meeting, all of whom expressed that they were impacted by Friday evening’s tragedy, voiced that I.V. culture needed to be directed in a positive direction in light of recent events.<br>\nMorrison opened the meeting by describing A.S. Public Safety Commission’s involvement within the I.V. community. Following Morrison’s brief introduction, audience members were given the opportunity to address others in the audience.  According to Morrison, the event was primarily aimed to educate students about what public safety resources were available to them and what avenues were available for getting involved with public safety in I.V.<br>\n“I think a lot of students came to the meeting tonight not knowing what Public Commission was or did at all or what resources they had in the community and in A.S.,” Morrison said. “I think our community came together tonight with a bunch of great ideas and I hope we can move forward as group dedicated to improving Isla Vista.”<br>\nFirst-year computer engineering major Robert Stosick presented three ideas at the meeting to prospectively improve safety in I.V. such as the installation of a siren system, a gunfire locating system such as ShotSpotter — a program that installs dozens of sensors in an area in order to immediately relay gunshot locations — and emergency phone stations throughout I.V. However, Stosick was uncertain the ideas introduced by him and others would reach fruition.<br>\n“I would like to think the ideas brought up by all of us tonight will be taken into consideration, but I do not know if these ideas can be carried out because Isla Vista does not have its own form of government and is entirely dependent on outside entities,” Stosick said.<br>\nMorrison also said all audience suggestions would be taken into consideration, including better fencing along the bluffs of I.V. and a possible I.V. community center.<br>\n“It is hard to say what is practical right now as Isla Vista is not a self-governing body, but I think we can take it upon ourselves to improve fencing conditions,” Morrison said. “I also think it is possible for us to take an existing building and create a community center building.”<br>\nAccording to Morrison, another public safety meeting is in the works and any students interested in I.V. public safety can check out the “UCSB AS Public Safety Commission” Facebook page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/","id":3014,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3013,3012,3011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senators Amend Student Lobby, Swear in Execs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last night, students identifying as members of Coalition for Survivors silently protested the last Associated Students Senate meeting for the 2013-2014 academic school year, during which senators pass...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students identifying as members of Coalition for Survivors silently protested the last Associated Students Senate meeting for the 2013-2014 academic school year last night, during which senators passed a controversial resolution to amend the legal code for Student Lobby and turned over their positions to the new senators for the 2014-2015 school year.</p>\n<p>The bill to update Student Lobby’s legal code included a provision that would allow the elected External Vice President of Statewide Affairs to appoint the chair, or co-director, of Student Lobby, which drew criticism from members of Student Lobby but ultimately passed. Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers offered their reflections on the year and advice for their replacements. As of press time, new senators and executive members had not yet taken their positions.</p>\n<p>Many members of Student Lobby said they felt the process did not take into account the requests of the group, despite acknowledging the potential for collaboration and improvement. During public forum, Student Lobby co-chair Maria Flores said she believes issues could be resolved in manner that involve more student input.</p>\n<p>“We feel that there could be a more inclusive way to go about it,” Flores said. “We don’t negate the fact that student lobby could be changed for the better.”</p>\n<p>Current EVPSA Alex Choate read a letter from the 2011-2012 EVPSA Ahmed Mostafa in favor of the bill, which stated that the bill would help to create a “strong coalition between Student Lobby and EVPSA.”</p>\n<p>During A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s report, he defended the bill on the basis that many other UC campuses function with a stronger relationship between the EVP and the Student Lobby group, and that the EVPSA had always picked the chair until two years ago. According to Abboud, the change came as a result of personal vendettas within the association, rather than necessity.</p>\n<p>“The External Vice President used to pick the chair of Student Lobby, and then Ahmed won and they didn’t like him so they changed it,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Andre Theus, author of the bill, reported to senate that Student Lobby was unhappy with its unexpected and sudden timing and requested that the bill be pulled. However, he also said he recognized some ways the bill would benefit the organization.</p>\n<p>Second-year Student Lobby member Mohsin Mirza said he did not agree with the concept of allowing senators to significantly change a group that they were not directly involved in.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very dangerous precedent for students to restructure something who have not been involved in this,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Some Senators said they did not agree with the process of drawing up the bill, but did support the notion of creating a stronger coalition between the office of the EVPSA and Student Lobby.</p>\n<p>Senator Nick Onyshko said there should be more consideration for the solidarity of A.S. as a whole.<br>\n“It’s a little concerning to hear rhetoric such as autonomy…when we are one association,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>The bill passed with 12 votes in favor, 6 against, and 4 abstentions.</p>\n<p>As the process of swearing in new executives began, protesters from the Coalition for Survivors silently held up signs condemning administration and campus organizations for allegedly failing to address accusations of sexual assault made by second-year global studies major Crystal Long on April 23 against incoming External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers spoke about their experiences in office and offered words of advice.</p>\n<p>Abboud advised incoming officials and senators to treat each other with kindness, disregard party politics as much as possible, and keep overarching, long-term goals in mind.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be mean, don’t be petty towards each other. Don’t let party politics takeover A.S,” Abboud said. “Be mindful when you’re making decisions…we can’t lose sight of tuition increases becoming real.”</p>\n<p>Outgoing Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet devoted her time to thanking the senators, her co-executives and the A.S. staff members for supporting and accompanying her throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Outgoing EVPLA Alex Moore told incomers to remember that their actions will affect future generations of students.</p>\n<p>“Remind yourself that you’re laying down the tracks that the next generation will follow,” Moore said. “If you take yourself seriously … then you will be taken seriously.”</p>\n<p>Choate echoed Abboud’s plea that new elected officials remain respectful of each other, and advised them to stay true to their opinions.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said senators should make an effort to consider opposing opinions and listen to those that they disagreed with.</p>\n<p>“Take into consideration what the opposition has to say,” Whittaker said.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution opposing hydraulic fracturing, and decided to pull a bill that would have restructured the legal code for A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55474\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbOPP/posts/588512774581425\">The Open People’s Party</a></strong> rescinded Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras’ party membership and requested her resignation last Friday in light of sexual assault allegations directed at her on April 23.</p>\n<p>Despite OPP’s decision, Contreras is under no obligation to step down from her position and has said she does not plan to do so. However, a petition circulating now would force a recall election if signed by ten percent of the students who voted in last month’s election for the EVPLA position — a total of 514 signatures — in accordance with Associated Students <a title=\"A.S. Election Code\" href=\"http://www.as.ucsb.edu/elections/_downloads/elections-code-2014.pdf\"><strong>Election Code</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>OPP’s statement and the petition came in response to a <a title=\"Long's blog post\" href=\"http://coalitionforsurvivorsucsb.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/dear-ucsb-community/\"><strong>blog post</strong></a> by second-year global studies major Crystal Long concerning an alleged incident of sexual assault perpetrated against her by Contreras. Contreras, who was in the midst of her campaign when Long’s blog post went public, responded in a <strong><a title=\"Google cache of Contreras' blog post\" href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pzKp3bSzrREJ:justiceintruth.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/the-truth/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">blog post</a></strong> of her own, but removed it only hours after posting.</p>\n<p>According to Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies major, OPP’s decision to proceed with the statement without consulting her or having all party executives present invalidates their request and undermines the party’s democratic process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote\">“Requesting the resignation of an elected official as a party is frankly ridiculous and sets a dangerous precedent,”</span> Contreras said in an email. “Party leadership said they would not take any immediate action without consulting me, and not all party executives were present when the decision was made.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major and OPP Party Chair Derek Wakefield said although not everyone chose to speak, a sufficient number of party members came to a consensus to make the party’s actions legitimate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people, not the execs essentially, had opinions and voiced them, and there were discussions and arguments on either side,” Wakefield said. “Eventually it came to the point where one person said they wanted to vote.”</p>\n<p>Wakefield said this consensus was reached because party members recognized the importance of supporting sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>“When it’s said that way it makes it very clear that we are advocates for survivors of sexual assault,” Wakefield said. “We are staunch opponents and attempters to revise and end rape culture.”</p>\n<p>However, Long said OPP’s decision was merely a political move to protect their party reputation rather than a stance against sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the bigger concern with them, to be completely honest, is just to save face,” Long said. “They let go of Beatrice, so they stopped supporting her. So in the end, who do they support? It’s really just themselves.”</p>\n<p>Contreras agreed with Long’s criticism of OPP’s motives and said the statement was not issued out of respect for victims of sexual assault but to preserve the party’s standing.</p>\n<p>“They were concerned about attempts to remove me from office because it could damage me and the party’s reputation,” Contreras said in an email. “The party seems concerned with its image far more than anything else.”</p>\n<p>Contreras also said OPP’s decision was not legitimate due to the pressure that those in the majority placed on other members, and that she is being singled out only because of the public nature of the allegations made against her.</p>\n<p>“I know individual party members who don’t agree with what happened and felt coerced into voting a certain way,” Contreras said in an email. “Crystal is right that I am not the only member to be accused of sexual assault, but I am the only person being removed because of it. … I am being attacked because people are afraid to support me.”</p>\n<p><em>Peter Mounteer contributed to this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/","id":3013,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3012,3011,3010],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":77,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
