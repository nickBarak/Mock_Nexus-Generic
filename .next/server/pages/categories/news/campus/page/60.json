The Altares Workshop, organized by graduate student Rosie Bermudez, will give participants the opportunity to create paper flowers, framed photographs and altars for remembrance. The altars, or “altares,” are decorated tributes to the deceased made of photographs, food and other meaningful items. The Santa Barbara Bowl celebration will begin at 4 p.m. and will showcase music from contemporary Latin bands and DJs, theatre and dance performances, art installations and altars made by local organizations, schools and museums.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double major Carmen Mares said while Dia de los Muertos is celebrated in parts of Latin America, it is centralized in Central and Southern Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Dia de los Muertos reminds us that death is a natural part of the human life and if a form of passage to the after-life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>According to Mares, the student-created altars will also be displayed at the Santa Barbara Casa De La Raza and UCSB Educational Opportunity Program’s “Celebracion De la Gente” event.</p>\n<p>“Altares are constructed with candles, photographs, food and items that the deceased person loved in life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said during Dia de Los Muertos, loved ones visit cemeteries, construct altares and cook traditional dishes for the deceased.</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she began celebrating Dia de los Muertos after volunteering at the event last year.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to realize how important it is to share it with my community and continue to pay my respects to my family members that have passed away,” Maldonado said. “It is a way to commemorate our ancestors, thank them for the wisdom they shared and keep their memory alive.”</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she was amazed by how much detail is involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“We decorate the venue, make beautiful and intricate altares, have giant calavera ‘skull’ puppets, free face painting, Aztec dancers, mariachi, art installments and much more,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said she has never participated in the Dia de los Muertos event and is excited to be part of the Chican@ experience.</p>\n<p>“Since I have never been to this kind of event, I am really excited to finally be able to be part of something that unifies the community through music and art to honor the dead,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>Delgado said although her parents are Mexico natives, she did not grow up celebrating Dia de los Muertos and wants to learn more about the holiday’s significance.</p>\n<p>“My family has never celebrated this event as much as other individuals do,” Delgado said. “I am looking forward to this new experience and [to being] more in touch with my culture and [celebrating] this beautiful event with others.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

F&amp;B) met Monday in the UCen State Street room to consider fourteen funding requests from 13 campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $31,294 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,655 in Senate unallocated, $45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $28,568 in Culture Weeks and Graduations, $27,000 for sports teams and $16,147 for academic teams. A.S. F&amp;B fully granted seven requests and tabled seven requests.</p>\n<p>American Indian Student Mentor Association (AISMA) requested $6,000 for their annual harvest festival introduced at last week’s meeting. AISMA agreed to use their one-time exception clause in allocating funds for the event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund their request.</p>\n<p>The University Recreation Center (UCen) requested $1,100 for their quarterly UStudy Program, which would allow the UCen to be open for 24 hours beginning Saturday of dead week until Thursday of finals week.</p>\n<p>UCen conference coordinator Samantha Moon said the UCen would also be providing study spaces, tutoring and snacks to students.</p>\n<p>“The UCen will be open for 24 hours, the lower-level conference rooms will be opened as study spaces and will be offering free tea, coffee and snacks after 1 a.m.,” Moon said. “We will also be holding CLAS sessions in Corwin Pavilion and free massages in Flying A Studios.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week to request further information.</p>\n<p>Native American Indigenous Languages (N.A.I.L.) requested $1,100 for their annual Workshop on American Indigenous Languages (W.A.I.L.). The workshop will be a daylong event with speakers presenting research on the various indigenous languages of the Americas.</p>\n<p>N.A.I.L. representative and graduate student Morgan Sleeper said the conference is a platform for undergraduate and graduate students, community members and scholars to present their research.</p>\n<p>“It’s an academic conference on American Indigenous Languages, and for many, this is a safe environment to present at their first academic workshop,” Sleeper said. “There’s also a scholarship program that is funded by the workshop.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>SB Hillel requested $160 for their Open Mic Night on Nov. 5 and their Hummus Cookoff Night on Nov. 10. The Open Mic Night allows students to watch and participate in singing. The Hummus Cookoff Night aims to educate people about the Jewish student population on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to bundle and fully fund the two requests.</p>\n<p>Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oS.T.E.M.) requested $450 to cover the registration fee for attendance at the fifth Annual oS.T.E.M. National Conference, which brings together students and professionals from various S.T.E.M. fields for professional development and networking.</p>\n<p>According to oS.T.E.M. representative and fourth-year chemistry major Sam Alcantar, the conference allows students to learn about resources for LGBTQIA+ professionals in S.T.E.M. fields while developing leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“oS.T.E.M. supports LGBTQIA+ people in S.T.E.M., an underrepresented community in S.T.E.M.,” Alcantar said. “There are big LGBTQIA+ hiring companies at the conference. We’re building as a chapter and we hope new members develop and learn leadership skills.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the request.</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Wellness requested $13,500 to purchase a vending machine for sexual reproductive health products. The vending machine would operate 24-hours every day of the week and dispense items such as emergency contraception (Plan B), condoms, lube, tampons, pads and nonprescription pain relievers.</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Wellness representative and third-year biology major Eyra Dordi said the purpose of the machine is to increase access to contraception on weekends and after hours when students do not have access to Student Health.</p>\n<p>“The problem we have on campus right now is that there is a lack of access to Plan B on campus on the weekends. Currently, at Student Health, you can get Plan B for $25 which is much cheaper than other places where Plan B can cost up to $50 or $60,” Dordi said. “The problem is if you have unprotected sex on a Friday, you would not be able to get Plan B from Student Health until Monday, when Plan B would be far less effective.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week to discuss the logistics of the machine and to consider bundling the request with Health &amp; Wellness’s condom dispenser.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos requested $400 for their Annual Thanksgiving potluck that will be held in Santa Catalina Hall’s Linda Vista Room.</p>\n<p>A Hermanos Unidos representative said the event is for everyone at UCSB and provides a dinner for those who are unable to go home for Thanksgiving break.</p>\n<p>“The money is for a Thanksgiving potluck, which this year we are opening up to everyone at UCSB to spread awareness of our organization and give students who can’t go home for Thanksgiving a Thanksgiving Dinner,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week with stipulation that Hermanos Unidos request funding from Santa Catalina’s Hall Council.</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta requested $1,815 for their annual spaghetti fundraiser dinner. The event will be held on Nov. 15 and is an open-community event to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta president and fourth-year communications major Kelly Ikeda said the annual event is in honor of a fellow sorority sister who passed away due to leukemia and will support current sisters who have family members battling the diseases.</p>\n<p>“We started this event because a sister of Kappa Alpha Theta at Cal Poly SLO, our neighboring school, passed away from leukemia several years ago,” Ikeda said. “This year we also have three sisters who have family members who were recently diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event with the stipulation that Kappa Alpha Theta purchase all utensils, napkins and plates from A.S. Recycling.</p>\n<p>Korean Campus Ministry (KCM) requested approximately $500 to send 45 members to a KCM winter retreat.</p>\n<p>KCM representative and fourth-year language, culture and society major Carrie Han said the retreat is for all eight chapters of KCM.</p>\n<p>“This can also be considered a conference,” Han said. “We’re hoping that our members grow not only spiritually but also as leaders.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week with the stipulation that KCM bring a more precise budget plan.</p>\n<p>The Wildlife Society requested $450 to host a showing of a National Geographic TV program in I.V. Theater.</p>\n<p>Wildlife Society representative Chad Moura said the event would help grow their club’s presence on campus and provide entertainment for those who are passionate about wildlife.</p>\n<p>“We’re holding this event to spread awareness for our club since we are a smaller organization,” Moura said.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B tabled the request for a week with stipulation that they request funding from the Office of Student Life’s After Dark Late Night Social Programming program.</p>\n<p>Raices De Mi Tierra requested $13,154 for reimbursement for an event they held last year and funding to host the same event this year.</p>\n<p>Raices De Mi Tierra officer Aimee Sarabia said the event invites middle and high school students to UCSB to learn traditional Mexican dances and partake in campus tours.</p>\n<p>“We taught students from the ages of 14 to 17 traditional Mexican dances and also held campus tours,” Sarabia said.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week with stipulation that they talk to the A.S. Associated Director of Administration Cindy Lopez to discuss the funding they did not receive last year.</p>\n<p>UCSB Wrestling Club requested $520 for travel expenses, hotel expenses and competition expenses to attend a National Collegiate Wrestling Association Tournament.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major and UCSB Wrestling Club Representative Elliot Park said the funding would allow lower-income students to attend the event and allow all wrestlers to have an equal opportunity to compete as UCSB athletes.</p>\n<p>“We’re asking for funding for our lower-income wrestlers to go to a tournament in Fresno,” Park said. “We want to provide all of our athletes an equal opportunity to compete as UCSB athletes at the highest level and a chance to go to Nationals.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the request.</p>\n<p>The International Student Association requested $580 for a weekly coffee event.</p>\n<p>International Student Association representative and fourth-year actuarial science major Gary Wang said the event aims to give all students a place to learn more about various cultures.</p>\n<p>“I’m requesting funds for our weekly coffee hour event, where we invite all international students for coffee and pizza. We learn about different cultures and give international students a place to talk about their cultures,” Wang said.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the request considering the use of the organization’s one-time exception.</p>\n<p>Dia de los Muertos Planning Committee requested $1,000 to hold an altar-building event for Dia de los Muertos.</p>\n<p>Event Coordinator and fourth-year history of public policy major Paola Villegas said the event is welcome to all students who wish to celebrate the holiday.</p>\n<p>“EOP from the Chican@ Studies group is holding an event where students will be able to build altars for Dia de los Muertos,” Villegas said. “The other events for Dia de los Muertos are more educational and everyone is welcome to build an altar.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request indefinitely with the stipulation that the Dias de los Muertos Planning Committee specifically determine how they would use the funds for the event.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-65754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Arts &amp; Lectures hosted “Untamed Antarctica” Sunday with renowned climber and National Geographic explorer Mike Lebecki speaking at Campbell Hall about his 2012 expedition to Bertha’s Tower.</p>\n<p>Lebecki was the first person to climb Bertha’s Tower, naming the 2,000-foot granite spire after his grandmother who passed away before the expedition began. During the event, Lebecki presented photojournalist Cory Richards’ documentation of the expedition and recounted the details of climbing in below-freezing temperatures, traversing unusually sharp rocks and taking shelter from extreme wind.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the expedition had an aura of excitement before it began due to the location and height of Bertha’s Tower, which looks like a sharp spike of rock.</p>\n<p>“This particular expedition felt like it would be the biggest one of our lives,” Lebecki said.<br>\nLebecki said the jutting rock looked like a foreign planet.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really alien landscape; we could have been looking at Mars,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, his team was delayed three weeks shortly after the trip began due to heavy winds ranging from 40 to 80 mph. Lebecki said when the crew finally arrived at the base of the tower, the heavy winds continued to make travel difficult.</p>\n<p>“The weather [in Antarctica], it’s raw and it’s brutal and it just beats the shit out of you,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said although the team had originally planned to travel by kite skiing, the strong winds pulled kites out of the explorers’ hands. Lebecki said the slick, wind-polished ice made hand skiing impossible, forcing the team to walk using spiked boots. The sharp rocks on Bertha’s Tower raised concerns of cut ropes if someone fell, making trust a primary requirement for the expedition, according to Lebecki.<br>\n“We were all putting our lives in somebody’s hand,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, the crew made camp and began preparing for their final push toward the peak after scaling 1,200 feet and placing anchors in the tower’s face. Lebecki led the final push to the summit.<br>\n“All of my experience for the last 20 years was for this moment,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the panoramic views from the camera were breathtaking, but the team could only stay for twenty minutes before it was necessary for them to begin rappelling back down.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Matthew Edmiston said the whole expedition was difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how he did it, how he got the rope up there; it was like a flying city, with him and his crew and his gear, I don’t know how he got it all up there,” Edmiston said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki’s mother Charlotte said she admires her son’s profession.</p>\n<p>“Every story is new to me and I just love hearing it and seeing it, especially the videos are just breathtaking,” Charlotte Lebecki said. “I am in awe of what he does, and I feel very fortunate to see what he sees.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Marissa Rajczi said it was inspiring to hear about Lebecki’s experiences, having recently experienced the difficulty of climbing.</p>\n<p>“It was especially exciting to hear Mike’s first-hand account of his Antarctic expedition given that yesterday I went outdoor free climbing for the first time,” Rajczi said. “I could appreciate the mental and physical stamina it must have taken him to complete such a climb, and found myself in awe as I related my own experiences to his.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Barbara’s 2015 Distinguished Alumnus and former NASA astronaut José Hernández was honored Saturday during the Dream Luncheon for his career and support for youth S.T.E.M. education in the Stockton, California area.</p>\n<p>Hernández earned a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from UCSB in 1986 before joining NASA, and in 2008 he was a mission specialist aboard space shuttle <em>Discovery </em>as part of Mission STS-128. Hernández spoke on the challenges of pursing a prestigious career as an immigrant and first-generation student. The luncheon raised $9,000 for the Dream Scholar Fund at UCSB, established in 2013 to aid undocumented students who come from low-income backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Hernández said he urges young people to “dream big” when choosing a career to pursue.</p>\n<p>“We have these great programs at UCSB, but really it falls on the individual to achieve their dream,” Hernández said. “You have to say, ‘I am gonna do it.’ I was rejected 11 times to NASA’s astronaut training program before I was accepted.”</p>\n<p>Hernández, who grew up in California as an immigrant, said his second grade teacher convinced his parents to remain in Stockton, California so he and his siblings could receive a stable education.</p>\n<p>“She was able to convince my parents that the nomadic lifestyle our family was living was hindering their kids’ educations,” Hernández said. “From that point on, we, for the most part, stayed in Stockton, and that helped me succeed in school and eventually reach college.”</p>\n<p>Hernández said he knew he wanted to become an astronaut in 1972 when he saw Apollo 17 on the news.</p>\n<p>“I still remember newscaster Walter Cronkite narrating the Apollo 17 mission,” Hernández said. “I was just mesmerized by astronaut Gene Cernan walking on the surface of the moon. At the moment, I was like, ‘this is what I want to be.’”</p>\n<p>Congressman from California’s 29th district and UCSB alumnus Antonio Cárdenas, who was studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate while Hernández was earning his master’s degree, also spoke at the event. Cárdenas said he and Hernández were “buddies” during their shared time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I looked up to him back then because at that time, and unfortunately still today, there were very few Latinos who were in grad school,” Cárdenas said. “To me, he is an inspiration because he went a step further with his education and his education ultimately helped prove to everybody that the sky is not the limit; he became an astronaut.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and global studies double major Pedro Villalobos said Hernández’s story is “inspiring” as he comes from a “similar background.”</p>\n<p>“My parents were also fieldworkers. They worked on dairy farms and also as gardeners,” Villalobos said. “To see someone who was able to graduate and myself, who is just about to graduate — it was inspiring to know there are opportunities after graduation to make an impact in the world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

id=\"caption-attachment-65715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neil Yanga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at Cornell University Adam Seth Levine hosted a seminar titled “Citizen Engagement (and Disengagement) in Response to Climate Change” to discuss the communication of climate change at Bren Hall Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Levine presented research on how personalizing information about environmental issues affects people’s attitudes. Levine’s research is based on an experiment in which he gave sheets presenting the issue of climate change to different subject groups with varying degrees of urgency and observed which participants chose to sign a petition in support of political action on climate change. He found those who received more personalized, urgent information were less likely to want to engage in a solution.</p>\n<p>Levine said people become less willing to conserve resources when climate change is presented as an urgent, personalized issue.</p>\n<p>“It might have cognitive consequences which might decrease the belief that because the really important goal is difficult to achieve, perhaps what I need to do is conserve my resources to focus on those goals,” Levine said. “What we are finding is that seemingly helpful rhetoric can backfire in [a] really important and consequential way, and that it is important to highlight that,” Levine said.</p>\n<p>Bren Environmental Science and Management (EMS) graduate student Michelle Graff said Levine’s research contradicted her preexisting ideas.</p>\n<p>“It is a belief that you should make things more personal because somebody can find those connections,” Graff said. “So I did think it was really interesting that sometimes that actually does the exact opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Graff, using fear tactics to motivate people to act on environmental issues is ineffective.</p>\n<p>“There has generally been a shift in climate change communication to it being a doomsday kind of thing,” Graff said. “It will be difficult, but there are ways to approach it in a manageable way — more of focusing on people’s ability of what they can get done.”</p>\n<p>Bren EMS graduate student Tova Handelman said Levine’s research reveals why people are often pessimistic about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Maybe one of the reasons that the messaging against climate change has been so effective [is] because it kind of gives people the option to not do anything about it” Handelman said.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club member Robert Bernstein said Levine’s research is “priceless.”</p>\n<p>“Somebody has actually done evidential research on what it is that motivates people to do environmental action,” Bernstein said.</p><div

emotional issue. <em>Andrew Gates/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America hosted an event titled the “The Abortion Debate” between pro-choice UCSB professor of philosophy Quentin Gee and pro-life author Trent Horn to discuss abortion and women’s reproductive rights in the United States.</p>\n<p>Horn is the author of pro-life book Persuasive Pro-Life: How to Talk About Our Culture’s Toughest Issue, which claims to equip readers with the knowledge to be “a bold and effective apologist for the unborn.” Gee’s current research focuses on collective responsibility and the topic’s relation to ethical, political and legal philosophy. The debate format followed a 15-minute opening speech, 10-minute rebuttal and an eight-minute cross examination for each participant and ended with an audience Q&amp;A session. Ph.D. candidate in philosophy Keith Hess moderated the debate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Opening the evening’s discussion, Gee said debates at universities cannot be based on religious dogma and should instead pursue a “practically available, publically moral status” for the issue. Gee then posed a hypothetical “thought experiment” about the ethicality of aborting fetuses.</p>\n<p>“If you were in a fertility clinic which was about to burn down, and you could save one infant in basket or save 10,000 embryos in cold storage, I doubt anyone would vote to save the embryos.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, the “cutoff line” for permissible abortion can operate at 23 weeks gestational age. Gee said although it is a contentious issue, the fetus cannot commonly feel pain at this stage.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it is necessarily wrong afterwards, but as a precaution to avoid a potential problem,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>Gee said those who factor religious reasoning into the abortion debate lack knowledge of embryotic life.</p>\n<p>“If you do in fact think the embryo has same status as baby, approximately 50 percent of embryos fail to lead to full pregnancy because of an inability to implant to the uterine wall,” Gee said. “By this logic, if you don’t think God is the number one baby death enabler, death is not indicative of the status of a fetus.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the core of his argument is that a fetus’s conceivable rights do not hold precedence to a woman’s rights in controlling her body.</p>\n<p>“A fetus and newborn baby, even if they have interests, doesn’t mean they trump all other interests,” Gee said. “I think it is possible for a woman to say ‘I cannot take care of this baby’ … it wouldn’t be looked upon well … but I think this is permissible.”</p>\n<p>In his introductory statement, Horn said it is generally wrong to directly kill innocent human beings, that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is therefore wrong to kill fetuses.</p>\n<p>Horn then showed a series of photographs of fetuses at various stages of development from eight weeks to 22 weeks. According to Horn, abortion is the killing of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Abortion is not a passive removal of life, it is the act of killing a child via dismemberment,” Horn said. “It’s like giving someone a kidney and then ripping it out, killing him or her in a violent process.”</p>\n<p>Horn said because a fetus is a human with potential for growth, it follows that the fetus has the basic right to not be killed.</p>\n<p>“Saying an unborn is inhuman because it is just a fetus is like saying a 15-year-old is not a human because they are just a teenager,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>According to Horn, subjecting fetuses to a non-human status based on their inability to feel pain is an act of “ableism,” a form of discrimination based on stigmatizing disability. Horn also said Gee’s “thought experiment” is unfounded because logical decisions cannot be based on intuition.</p>\n<p>“My position is unborn [fetuses] are human organisms; all humans should have basic human rights regardless of their functional ability,” Horn said, “Just because we have different intuitions at different times doesn’t mean we should rely on our feelings. Instead, let’s look toward rational arguments.”</p>\n<p>The cross examination portion of the debate contrasted Horn’s requirement for a definition of personhood with Gee’s assertion that intuition plays a role in deciding the moral worth of a human in any stage.</p>\n<p>Gee said rather than a definition of personhood, the moral state of a fetus involves a “cluster of requirements.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sort of mental concept, no possibility for a rich mental life. It involves a conscious interest and desire to keep living,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>In response, Horn said a fetus does not need to consciously demonstrate its desire for life in order to be considered viable for the right of life.</p>\n<p>“I think you can have an interest in living without consciously alluding to it, because the zygote — there is some element of an interest in its living in terms of growth,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Horn and Gee began the Q&amp;A portion of the event by responding to the question of what would motivate the two participants to change their stance on the topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>Horn said he would require an argument separating the worth of humans with those of children.</p>\n<p>“I could be moved to change my mind if it could be shown that all human beings don’t have equal rights … that they don’t really have a right to live in the organ designed for them,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Gee said he would change his position if a fetus was shown to have certain mental capabilities.</p>\n<p>“I would require something on the order of showing that the organism in question has a deep, fairly rich mental life,” Gee said. “I think if you could show that, we could be concerned with killing the life.”</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, Gee said he would like to reassert his claim that a fetus’s rights should not be considered with more weight than a woman’s “deeply personal” autonomy over her own body.</p>\n<p>“While there is some value for whichever stage the zygote or fetus is in, I don’t think it is a value that trumps a woman’s right to bodily integrity,” Gee said. “If there was a body that had the same moral status as you and me, then there would be more value.”</p>\n<p>In Horn’s closing statement, he said humans should be defined and valued by their membership in a social community rather than their functional capabilities.</p>\n<p>“Human beings should be valued not for their functions, but because they belong to this community. I think an important question tonight is ‘Who are we allowed to kill?’” Horn said. “We should have a pit in our stomach regardless of whether it is a child or a fetus, because in the end, they all have the same intrinsic potential.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Delaney Forester said she wanted to further understand Horn’s position.</p>\n<p>“Horn made a comment earlier about a biological parent’s inherent responsibility to take care of a child unless they are deemed unfit,” Forester said. “My question is, what is the deciding factor in what makes you unfit?”</p>\n<p>Hess said the audience contributed to a civil and constructive debate, allowing both speakers to properly assert their views.</p>\n<p>“I liked how the students kept it civil. There wasn’t any … hot-heads or name-calling so I think this is the way that debates should be done,” Hess said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America President and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said the event was successful in fostering a productive discussion on the controversial topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>“I thought both speakers did a wonderful job. The audience also had really good questions,” Devlin said. “It was great how we could have a civil conversation about this sometimes controversial topic.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/","id":2642,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2641,2640,2639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate passes bills to establish student councils, redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds, and create a digital database. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S) Senate met Wednesday evening in the Flying A Room in the UCen to discuss three bills.</p>\n<p>Senate voted on and passed “A Bill to Establish a Student Council for the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and College of Engineering (CoE)” and “A Bill to Reform the Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund” and moved “A Bill to Promote Increased Transparency in A.S.” to the Campus Affairs Committee. Public forum included first-year CCS music composition major Jordan Mitchell and Senate Coordinator and Director of Accountability Michelle May. Senators also provided a report of the “Breakfast with Librarians.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said he supports the creation of the CCS and CoE student council to improve campus representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“It is within our rights as an underrepresented college to be equally represented in university and student affairs at UCSB,” Mitchell said. “It will provide crucial space for CCS representation, helping [allow us] to do much more things.”</p>\n<p>May said each senator must fulfill their senate responsibilities as outlined in the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“You all must undertake four or five projects this year,” May said.  “And one must be a group project.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian, senators had previously discussed the potential features of the new library space during the “Breakfast with Librarians” event.</p>\n<p>“The students wanted more outlets, so we are giving them outlets.” Hashemian said. “Another thing they’re really interested in — Senator [Jerel] Constantino brought this up — is e-books, so e-coursereaders, since textbook affordability is number one in their priority.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said she talked with librarians about creating resource centers, such as a space for mental health services in the library.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a transfer center in the inside of the library,” Jordan said. “They were super unwilling to have C.A.P.S. [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] — they wanted it to be strictly a study space.”</p>\n<p>The consent calendar was passed during this meeting, which included “A Bill to Create a Self-Care Portion for the Declaration of Candidacy Meeting,” “A Resolution to Create a Group Project For the Alternative Transportation Project,” “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senator Positions” and “A Resolution in Support of a Student Advisor Position to the UC Board of Regents and UC Regent Avi Oved’s Shared Governance Proposals.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino presented Austin Hechler’s bill “A Resolution to Make A.S. More Transparent,” which outlines the plan to improve A.S transparency through creating a digital database for important documents, including reports, minutes, bills, resolutions, projects and other related documents.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 12 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Plan B One-Step pill. <em>Courtesy of Her Campus UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>Her Campus at UC Santa Barbara is hosting an event at the University Center (UCen) Thursday in conjunction with contraceptive company Plan B One-Step, titled the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative to educate students on contraception.</p>\n<p>The event will be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and MTV “Girl Code” stars Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab will speak about their personal experiences, while health professionals will also be lecturing on important information to know concerning contraception. The nation-wide campaign, sponsored by Plan B One-Step, aims to educate women about their reproductive health and the various methods of contraception that are available to them.</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and third-year environmental studies major Helen Gannon said the primary objective of the event is to educate women on the emergency contraceptive Plan B, which is usually taken when other forms of birth control fail.</p>\n<p>“The main point is to make sure these women are educated in case their birth control plans do not go as perfectly as they had originally planned,” Gannon said in an email. “The initiative wants women to be true to themselves, without having the need to feel perfect, and do what they feel is right, to them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and fourth-year English major Kirby Beaton said she hopes the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative will help spread information about reproductive health to students who may have difficulty finding resources about Plan B.</p>\n<p>“I think this event will educate students about their options when it comes to reproductive health and that being imperfect is perfectly okay,” Beaton said in an email. “It will also be a way to engage with students through the photo booth and free goodies that our team will be offering!”</p>\n<p>Her Campus’s National team Campus Development Associate Cara Chiaramonte said the relatable experiences of the “Girl Code” stars will attract students to the event.</p>\n<p>“Carly and Nessa have imperfections just like the rest of us, and they’re letting college women know that it’s okay to embrace them,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “College women relate to other women who can be real and get on their level so I think having them on an initiative like this is perfect — no pun intended.”</p>\n<p>According to Chiaramonte, students from other universities have responded positively to the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative.</p>\n<p>“Students have been flocking to our awesome photo booth during the day to share what makes them Perfectly Imperfect,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “Student and local media outlets have been debunking common myths about emergency contraception at night.”</p>\n<p>Chiaramonte said she wants the audience to feel comfortable in their own skin, embrace their flaws and understand the options available to them when things do not go according to “plan.”</p>\n<p>“Our Her Campus chapter here at UCSB has worked extremely hard planning this event and bringing it to share with the UCSB community,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “We can’t wait to see it come to life!”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

and drought sustainability. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB is participating in the UC-wide #UCool Campus Challenge from Oct. 6 to Dec. 10 in an effort to reduce the University’s carbon footprint and make positive contributions to the environment.</p>\n<p>University of California and UC Berkeley’s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory created #UCool with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The campaign, modeled after the Cool California Cities Challenge, encourages students to accumulate points for each university by completing 50 online pledge challenges. The pledges include energy efficient moves such as switching to LED lighting and turning off computer monitors. Participants will have opportunities to win eco-efficient prizes such as solar-powered cellphone chargers, and the university with the highest score will be deemed the “Coolest UC Campus.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said the challenge will require a large amount of student participation to be effective, but he hopes the goal of carbon neutrality will be reached.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really cool campaign, and [with] more incentive for students to do it, it could be meaningful,” Berry said. “If we really are interested in [achieving] carbon neutrality, the school can do all they can, but if you have students who don’t care and don’t do work, we’re not going to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double-major Nicholas Frey said the most difficult part of the #UCool challenge is encouraging students to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“One of the harder challenges is changing people’s behavior on things,” Frey said. “One of the major issues is getting the student population engaged and educated on how they can be sustainable in their actions.”</p>\n<p>According to Frey, UCSB needs total student and faculty involvement for the campaign to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>\n<p>“I think you need infrastructure change, so you need to be, like, adding solar on campus to make it carbon neutral, but I don’t think it’s totally possible if you don’t have faculty and student engagement,” Frey said. “The whole campus can’t become carbon neutral if it’s just the facilities; it has to be the people also.”</p>\n<p>Frey said students should contribute anything they can to the challenge even if they cannot be consistent in their actions.</p>\n<p>“[A misconception] is that you have to be absolutely perfect, and if you slip up you’ll be criticized. That’s not the point; people shouldn’t feel … discouraged to be sustainable,” Frey said. “We don’t live in a world where being some perfect hippie environmentalist is even possible. I just encourage people to learn and explore.”</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Environmental Program Director Sarah Siedschlag, UCSB has already made great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has done a lot. For a research university of our size, we’re actually very good in water conservation … the vast majority of our landscape is done with recycled water,” Siedschlag said. “We are prepared, or becoming prepared, for a situation in the future where we might just have longer and longer droughts.”<br>\nSiedschlag said she hopes the Cool Campus Challenge will encourage students and faculty to “engage as groups” in efforts toward environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that it gets students to think about it and also makes it something that people talk about and is part of their daily lives, and that people don’t just do themselves but encourage their friends to do,” Siedschlag said. “I think that’s what’s really fun — people are building teams with the Cool Campus Challenge and getting really competitive about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UC achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 is an attainable goal.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on what you include and how far you are willing to go,” Siedschlag said.</p>\n<p>According to professor of sociology John Foran, the environment is the “defining issue” of the century.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue is climate change. It is the biggest existential threat to humanity ever because it calls the whole future into question,” Foran said. “We really have to make deep, deep changes in the ways we organize ourselves in society.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, converting to a vegetarian or vegan diet is “without question, the single most important” factor in reducing students’ carbon footprint. Foran said the Cool Campus Challenge should emphasize the importance of this change.</p>\n<p>“This is an important thing to underline: the UC Cool Campus Challenge and the perspective of the impact of food, diet and individual behavior change,” Foran said. “The Campus Challenge, as good as it is, needs to be recalibrated to the reality of that. That is good for climate, that is good for our health, pollution, good for the oceans, and it’s good for reducing inequality on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>Berry also said he believes food choices have a very real effect on the environment.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest things [affecting] environmental climate change is how we eat, and Americans really enjoy meat, and meat is detrimental to the environment, especially in the way it is produced,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UCSB has a good chance at winning the challenge because of student and faculty dedication to the environment.</p>\n<p>“I think we do have a good chance,” Siedschlag said. “We’ve got a lot of really dedicated students and a lot of groups that have gotten really into it, there’s still plenty of time left, and I think we can definitely do it.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/","id":2672,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2671,2670,2669],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor at UCSB To Give T.E.D.

Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University Dina Okamoto gave a lecture titled “Asian American Panethnicity and Shifting Ethnic Boundaries” Thursday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) to discuss Asian-American identity throughout history.</p>\n<p>Okamoto spoke about Asian ethnic groups in the United States and how various social and cultural forces led to the creation of the panethnic Asian-American group, a term and identity used to describe Americans from all Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, Asian ethnic groups in America did not organize to form a shared panethnic identity until 1968.</p>\n<p>“Before 1968, the legal identity of Asian Americans was divided, with representatives from China, Japan, Korea,” Okamoto said. “They didn’t form alliances — instead they formed their own separate ethnic communities with their own systems of social assistance and support, and at times they intentionally distinguished themselves from one another.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto also said there are a variety of differences between Asian ethnic groups, preventing the formation of a unified group prior to 1968. According to Okamoto, social, religious and economic factors contributed to separations between Asian immigrant groups in America.</p>\n<p>“They spoke different languages; they brought different cultural traditions with them from their homeland; they also practiced different religions. This is something that still happens today,” Okamoto said. “I would also argue that during this period different ethnic groups didn’t work together in the fields … because they arrived in successive waves to the United States. When one group fell out of favor, another group came to meet the labor demand.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, a new Asian-American identity formed in the 1960s when Asian-Americans sought involvement in the black power movement, the anti-war movement and protests at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State for ethnic studies programs.</p>\n<p>“Asian American students and community activists began to realize their unique position and perspective, and they created an identity that encompassed all Asian origin groups,” Okamoto said. “They rejected the label ‘oriental’ because it represented the European colonialist view and instead adopted the identity of Asian-American.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto said the creation of a panethnic group like Asian-American does not replace individual ethnic groups such as Chinese and Korean-Americans.</p>\n<p>“I argue that when panethnicity occurs — when ethnic backgrounds expand to other groups and an all encompassing identity — this doesn’t necessarily mean that boundaries have been displaced or attenuated,” Okamoto said. “Instead, the boundaries can have a layered quality where multiple identities can coexist and even be complimentary.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, the creation of panethnic groups allows immigrant groups to build new, powerful communities.</p>\n<p>“By trying to alter widely agreed-upon racial categories through organizing, Asian-Americans have attempted to change the meaning of these racial categories,” Okamoto said. “By doing this, immigrant groups can create new forms of community and identity and can call for shifts in the current distribution of resources.”</p>\n<p>MCC program director Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Okamoto was invited to the MCC’s “Race Matters” series to emphasize a theme of intersectionality and bring a new perspective to the MCC.</p>\n<p>“The logic of the ‘Race Matters’ series is to bring a diverse group of academic experts working in various fields that intersect with race in one form or another,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “We wanted a representative from the Asian-American community to bring diversity and variance to the MCC, and Dina Okamoto’s work is very cutting edge, and she’s an incredible sociologist.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Arpan Singh said she enjoyed hearing about Asian-American involvement in the 1960s protest movement.</p>\n<p>“I liked how she explained the different perspectives in the protest movement,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Annie Hikido said issues of Asian American identity are especially relevant in California.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important, particularly in California, [which] does have an incredibly large Asian American population that is increasing both as a general race and as the ethnicities within it,” Hikido said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

emergency contraceptive company Plan B One-Step Thursday in front of the UCen to educate students about various birth control options.</p>\n<p>The “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative serves to promote the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step through events held at college campuses throughout the country. At UCSB’s event, students had the chance to learn information about various contraceptive options, participate in a photo booth and interact with MTV series “Girl Code” celebrities Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab. Aquilino, Diab and Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Diana Ramos spoke about the campaign and Plan B One-Step, followed by a Q&amp;A session at a media event in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he is happy to see a campus event on sexual education.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s really good that it’s on campus because I feel like our country just doesn’t give people the sex education that they need, so I think it’s a good resource to be on campus,” Tang said.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Natasha Mehrdad said Her Campus’s involvement in the campaign emphasized the theme of female empowerment.</p>\n<p>“The fact that Her Campus is involved with all of it brings back the whole feminist ‘girl power’ vibe to it,” Mehrdad said. “They are all so open and welcoming and all that stuff.

Dr. Ramos said the active ingredient in the Plan B One-Step is levonorgestrel, a manufactured hormone in a class of medications called progestins.</p>\n<p>“87 percent of the women’s survey believe that emergency contraception will harm the existing pregnancy, and the reality is it will not — as a matter of fact, it helps prevent a pregnancy,” Dr. Ramos said. “So, it’s really important to realize that it works similar to the way birth control [works], but you’ve got one hormone at a much higher dose, so it is not an abortive agent.”</p>\n<p>Diab said it is important to make self-image decisions based off of facts and evidence, not societal pressures.</p>\n<p>“We live in a world right now where we’re being judged all the time — there’s so much pressure from day to day,” Diab said. “When you have this pressure to constantly be perfect, you might make decisions based off pressure and … that’s why it’s important to be true to yourself … to be prepared for situations like this and to accept the fact that we’re not perfect.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/","id":2643,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[2642,2641,2640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morris Dees Gives Social Activism Lecture","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/morris_dees.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/morris_dees.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Co-Founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and civil rights lawyer Morris Dees gave a lecture about his activism titled “With Justice for All in a Changing America” Wednesday night at Ca...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Co-Founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and civil rights lawyer Morris Dees gave a lecture about his activism titled “With Justice for All in a Changing America” Wednesday night at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The lecture, hosted by the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life, highlighted recent social justice issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, student activism and two of Dees’ most notable lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Dees earned a law degree from the University of Alabama in 1960, after which he founded the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, a nonprofit legal advocacy specializing in civil rights and combating hate and intolerance. In 2006, the National Law Journal included Dees in its list of the top 100 most influential lawyers in America.</p>\n<p>Dees said some people feel threatened by the increase of diversity in American in recent years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like America’s changed a lot in 15 years. This changing demographics and what it portends for the next 20, 30 years, it’s creating an enormous fear — a fear for those people who felt that they were privileged,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “xenophobia” becomes more prevalent as cultures mix. Providing an example of this, Dees said he once represented Vietnamese fishermen after white fishermen mistreated them in Houston, Texas in 1981.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t long before they were out-fishing the American fishermen,” Dees said. “There’s no other way to put it but the American fishermen got jealous.”</p>\n<p>Dees said the white fishermen enlisted the help of the KKK, but he won the case on behalf of the Vietnamese one day before the shrimping season began, at which time the United States Marshals began protecting the Vietnamese fishermen.</p>\n<p>Dees said a television network that “starts with the letter F” spreads distorted information in order to create a reactionary response that spreads hate and intolerance.</p>\n<p>“We have mainstream hate in America and it’s because of these changing demographics,” Dees said. “America is great because of its diversity, not in spite of it.”</p>\n<p>Dees said he is disappointed by how popular Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has become and disapproves of his plan to deport millions of immigrants.</p>\n<p>“It’s saddening that the American public would buy into this,” Dees said. “Facts don’t seem to matter when you have a demigod leading the pack.”</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “98 percent of police officers” in the United States are good people, but Americans, especially racial minorities, are being victimized by the remaining two percent.</p>\n<p>“Innocent African-Americans and others are being shot by trigger-happy police officers,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>Walter H. Capps Center Public Service Intern and fourth-year global studies major Lindsay Apperson said Dees’ activism is inspiring, especially given his continued work at the age of 78.</p>\n<p>“He has done so much incredible social work and empowered a lot of marginalized populations,” Apperson said. “He’s … still fighting court cases against injustices. It’s pretty incredible.”</p>\n<p>Apperson said she was surprised when she saw the majority of the audience was not students, but rather older attendees.</p>\n<p>“It was a lot of more elderly members of the greater Santa Barbara community than students, which I thought was a little disappointing,” Apperson said.</p>\n<p>Dees said students have a chance to participate in the ongoing movement for tolerance and civil rights.</p>\n<p>“To the students here tonight: you have a front-row seat on that march for justice,” Dees said. “You can either sit on that seat or become involved.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A panel of women comprised of two Planned Parenthood representatives, two Student Health representatives and two UCSB Women’s Center representatives discussed a variety of different methods for birth control. The six women dispelled common myths about each type of birth control, answered questions from attendees and demonstrated the usage of certain contraceptives with plastic models.</p>\n<p>Events for Love Your Body Week include pumpkin carving on Wednesday, a Zumba lesson on Thursday and a henna and body art activity taking place on Friday.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Marisa Allan said she attended the event to inquire about birth control pills and came away with knowledge on various other forms of birth control such as an Internal Uterine Device (IUD).</p>\n<p>“I like the open discussion because it takes the ‘sex is bad’ stigma away from talking about this,” Allan said. “I’d rather everyone be informed than regret something they might do.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Tao Nguyen, who tabled for Love Your Body Week on Monday, said she volunteered to be a part of the event because she wanted to be involved in an organization that provided “outreach for anyone.” According to Nguyen, loving your body includes loving your physical body as well as your sexuality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65620\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

accepting our own but cut others, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Lauren Paiste said she attended the discussion to learn more about basic contraceptive methods.</p>\n<p>“The open

of the campaign is to increase the size and diversity of the C.A.P.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should prioritise diversity in hiring more therapists … so that students don’t have to wait longer to see a therapist after they’ve seen a therapist for the first time,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>Zohoori said there are concerns about increasing outreach, because C.A.P.S. already has limited resources.</p>\n<p>“We also really want to work on outreach, but it’s a big catch-22 because the more outreach we do, the less we’ll be able to support our students with the care that they deserve,”
