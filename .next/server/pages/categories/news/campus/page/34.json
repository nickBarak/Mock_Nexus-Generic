Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises. <em>Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Ramadan takes place during the ninth month of the Muslim year, in which some Muslims fast for 30 days from sunrise to sundown.</p>\n<p>The dining commons will give students the option of taking a maximum of two meals out of the dining commons per meal period. They will be given one three-compartment takeout box and one cup with a lid.</p>\n<p>Those who choose to take two meals will be given two boxes. “We wanted flexibility for people,” said Jill Horst, dining director of Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises.</p>\n<p>Horst said that setting the two-box limit took into consideration that many students may not have the space or resources to store large amounts of food.</p>\n<p>The program has been ongoing for several years, according to Horst.</p>\n<p>Since Ramadan begins at different times each year, the holiday had fallen on summer in some years, so the university did not always need to make any accommodations.</p>\n<p>Portola, De La Guerra and Carrillo dining commons will all offer the service.</p>\n<p>Horst said her staff chose those three dining commons because they are open seven days a week and span all geographical areas of campus.</p>\n<p>Ramadan is one of few holidays for which the university provides special accommodations.</p>\n<p>“During Passover we have a Passover table, but other than that I feel that we’re able to meet the needs of our student population through our regular service,” Horst said.</p>\n<p>Those fasting have been asked to provide their names prior to the start of the program.</p>\n<p>Horst said this is so they can prepare for the amount of students who will need the compartment boxes.</p>\n<p>The number of students using this program ranges from 10 to 20, Horst said.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday evening, she has received three requests for the accommodation, and she anticipates more students will contact her.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Services District (I.V. CSD), will allow individuals to borrow one of the 1,200 bicycles that will be available.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are approximately 20,000 registered bicycles within UCSB and I.V.’s two square miles, according to the Associated Students Bicycle Committee.</p>\n<p>Matt Dobberteen, alternative transport manager from the Santa Barbara Public Works department, presented the program to the I.V. CSD alongside Mo Lovegreen, UCSB director of campus sustainability, on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a potential launch date of June 25, 2018, for the first allocation of 600 bikes in the area,” Dobberteen said.</p>\n<p>Following the first launch date, an additional 600 bikes will arrive in August, he explained.</p>\n<p>Each bike has an individual GPS tracking unit and bike lock attached, according to Dobberteen. This eliminates the need for a bike rack and lowers the chances of theft.</p>\n<p>Currently, the I.V. CSD is trying to find parking spaces for the bicycles.</p>\n<p>Every CSD board member supported the program, but a few members expressed skepticism about the program not having a permanent bike rack for students to park in.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman questioned how students would be prevented from leaving the bikes piled up on the side of the street.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said watching the flow of bikes and where they end up will be an important learning tool.</p>\n<p>“If there are heaps of bikes all over, we have failed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said potential solutions include giving students incentives to return bikes to a designated location in the evening or hiring a company that would park the bicycles in a designated location during the night.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen added that UCSB’s Department of Campus Sustainability also has plans to start a new outreach program for the bike sharing service starting next week. The program is directed at incoming freshmen in an attempt to persuade them to not bring their own bikes.</p>\n<p>The board of directors said the central problem with the program is finding the space for the bikes and persuading students to use the bikes in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“This is about us bringing high quality transportation to the community, and if we are respectful, it benefits everyone,” Dobberteen added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/","id":2276,"author":{"id":83,"name":"Luke Dorsey"},"related":[2275,2274,2273],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Retracts EVPSA Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <em>Nexus</em> is retracting its endorsement of Mayela Morales for the position of external vice president for statewide affairs.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> editorial board published endorsements of all executive candidates running in the Associated Students elections on Thursday, April 19.</p>\n<p>On April 15, the <em>Nexus</em> received an anonymous email alleging financial mismanagement by a student during a lobbying trip for students to speak with state and national representatives in early April in Washington, D.C. and in Sacramento in March. The student was running as an executive candidate in the spring A.S. election, according to the email.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> began to investigate the matter immediately but was unable to confirm which candidate the anonymous sender referred to.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Nexus</em> published its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/mayela-morales-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsement of Morales</a>, the editorial board began to receive other complaints about organizational conflicts during the student lobby visits. These complaints were from three anonymous sources that worked with Morales in preparation for these conferences.</p>\n<p>Morales was the internal director of Lobby Corps as well as a member of USSA, which organized both lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> editorial board was aware of complaints against an executive candidate prior to writing the endorsement, we needed confirmation through evidence and documentation to retract our choice. Our endorsement of Morales was based on an extensive interview process and a discussion with the editorial board.</p>\n<p>Based on Morales’s interview and other involvement on campus, we do believe Morales is the right person for the position; however, our investigation into the lobbying trip conflicts has led us to retract our endorsement.</p>\n<p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>, Morales failed to communicate with a colleague about transportation to the Sacramento lobby visit. The failure to communicate with the colleague in a timely manner resulted in a failure to organize the transportation.</p>\n<p>Further documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday, April 24, revealed Morales’s failure to complete the tasks she volunteered to do for a Washington, D.C. lobby visit, resulting in the untimely scheduling of flights and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning of planning the conference, I informed the EVPSA that I was having problems with my phone because it had been in repairs for a minute. As I couldn’t afford to buy a new phone, I told everyone involved in planning the conference that I would be providing my support during my individual meetings with them, rather than over text,” </span>Morales told the <em>Nexus</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the beginning of 2018, due to some family financial issues, I haven’t had phone service which has made communication, at times, impossible. This is something every person I work with has been aware of since the beginning,” Morales added in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As colleagues and friends, the other people involved in the planning of the trips were aware of some of the mental health related issues I was personally going through at the time,” Morales also said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position. We apologize for our endorsement in light of this new information.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from Morales regarding her communication while organizing the lobby visits.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anthony Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party, are the two candidates running for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their opening remarks, Maldonado spoke about wanting to integrate the Student Apartment Council in A.S. and wanting to expand resources like CalFresh and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) for students in university-owned off-campus apartments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez’s focus was about offering students a direct voice in senate and holding office hours at various university-owned off-campus apartments so students living there do not feel separated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to focus on mental health services and work with the Santa Catalina residence hall to open up their C.A.P.S. center to students in university-owned off-campus housing. She would also like to implement free yoga programs like ones that currently exist in the freshman dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to focus on revamping the orientation program for transfer students, since most students living in university-owned off-campus housing are transfer students. He said he is currently working with the Transfer Student Alliance on this issue and is interested in addressing the issue to make more students feel welcome at UC Santa Barbara when they first arrive. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNI-OWNED APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez plans to hold office hours within the various university-owned off-campus buildings in order to make himself and his position more available to students, as opposed to them having to come on campus to voice their concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado would work with the Student Apartment Council to fully integrate it with A.S., and she would also like to work with the transfer senator that is elected to meet the needs of students in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, as a current on-campus senator, explained she already has an understanding of the inner workings of A.S. and has experience listening to students’ concerns during public forum. She also believes that her strides to educate herself about issues regarding women of color make her better qualified to work as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez was the first diversity director for the Transfer Student Alliance and helped the organization work toward becoming an official A.S. entity. He also kickstarted the first transfer student graduation event, which is occurring later this year. </span></p>\n<p><b>STUDENTS’ NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in making students more active in their community, and he believes the best way to do so is by making resources available to students near their housing and not just on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado also wants to increase accessibility to resources provided by A.S. to students in university-owned off-campus apartments. In addition, she wants to increase awareness of C.A.P.S. and CalFresh. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAMILIES AND FACULTY OFF-CAMPUS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, in order to reach out to these communities, would canvass or send out polls in order for people to voice their concerns and tell her what they need from her. She’s also interested in forming a council or committee for these communities to be represented in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up dialogue to these communities, as he explained that he does not live there and would not immediately know how to address their concerns, but is interested in finding out and working with theExternal Vice President for Statewide Affairs’ (EVPSA) office to get more funding for families and faculty in off-campus housing. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNIVERSITY APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in implementing more social activities for students in university-owned off-campus housing. He also wants to have more organizations come to them so that students in those buildings are aware of organizations on campus that represent them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to continue to attend the meetings that students in university-owned off-campus housing hold and increase mental health resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to offer the University Apartment Council the opportunity to directly voice their concerns to A.S. by integrating the council into A.S. She would also want to work with them to see if they already have ideas to solve the issue and just need help implementing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up this issue to the students and hear about ideas that they might have to address the issue and work to execute them as well as work with the EVPSA and External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office to get funding for the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><b>NEW IDEAS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to ensure students’ voices are heard and serve as a liaison between students and A.S. to meet their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado feels the current university-owned off-campus senator has a good working relationship with the Transfer Senator and would like to carry on this relationship because  of the overlapping needs in both communities.

She referenced her position within UCSB’s Lobby Corps and said students need to put pressure on the state legislature to fund the UC.</span></p>\n<p><b>ADVOCACY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel spoke of her time on the senate, stating Senate has passed several resolutions in support of various communities on campus, specifically the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously I am not a part of all of the communities on campus and I can’t empathize with every single community, but as a woman, as a member of the LGBTQ community and also as a Jewish student, I can definitely sympathize with members of marginalized communities and I will always work to be their resource,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said as president, he would make sure that every community is heard at every level, specifically within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has been doing work with marginalized communities “pretty much my whole time at UCSB through protests, plannings, meetings, pretty much everything under the sun.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PRIORITIES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said his priority as president would be making sure that A.S. listens to the general student body because “A.S. shouldn’t be deciding on what we focus on based on ourselves, we should be talking about the needs of the community members and making sure that they understand that we are here for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said A.S. needs to prioritize completing projects that may be lost from year to year and creating a continuing projects coordinator position within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he has been involved with “every space on campus” and referenced his time with the RCSGD and Queer Commission among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel again spoke of her time on senate and about her experiences with marginalized communities on campus.

Kopel recently announced her opposition to the UCen project through a Facebook statement on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said “renovating the UCen is really, really important” but said he believed the renovations should not be paid for with student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can vote in the A.S. election on G.O.L.D. from April 23 to April 26.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Loudon is running with Campus United and Morales with the Isla Vista Party, both of which push for mostly progressive political ideals.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) serves as the official Associated Students representative of student engagement at state and national levels. In past years, the EVPSA has been the focal point of organizing student lobbying trips and making statements to the community about local, state and national political issues.</p>\n<p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS:</strong></p>\n<p>Loudon, a second-year history of public policy major, spoke about fighting with state legislators for better higher education funding and mentioned food insecurity as one of her largest concerns. She referred to her experience as the co-chair of Lobby Corps and her time served working as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“As someone who’s first worked in politics and focused on legislation, I’ve found the office to be a really easy home to have here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Morales, a fourth-year global studies and Chicanx studies major, spoke to the same ideas, adding that funding for public education should extend to all grade levels and not just the university level. She spoke to her own experience lobbying and her credentials as a lead organizer for the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p>Morales’ relationships with public officials like Assemblywoman Monique Limón, she said, make her qualified to work with politicians to alleviate problems like student food insecurity. She spent time lobbying for bills, including one that would make it possible for students to receive the Cal Grant during summer sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST ACTION IN OFFICE:</strong></p>\n<p>Securing “state investment” would be Loudon’s top priority if elected. That doesn’t apply to simply fighting tuition hikes, she said, but rather getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students. She mentioned her own connections to local politicians, including State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson of Santa Barbara, as a route to getting UCSB students to the state government’s ear.</p>\n<p>In March, the UC Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition hike for nonresident students. Morales attended the meeting where the decision was laid down, she said, and was confronted by a police officer while protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>Loudon noted voter registration as another top priority of hers. She’s worked on getting students from “across the UC system” registered to vote. Strengthening programs like the United States Students Association would be crucial to making sure students stay active and represented in politics, she said.</p>\n<p><strong>ON-CAMPUS EFFORTS:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>After working personally with the past two EVPSA offices, Loudon said she wants to increase education surrounding mental health — not just regarding the problem itself, but how students can utilize existing resources to improve their own circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of work focused on expanding resources, which is very necessary,” Loudon said. “But I’ve had so many conversations with students on our campus who aren’t aware of existing programs that already benefit them from the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Morales hasn’t worked directly in the EVPSA office, but said she has high praise for it.</p>\n<p>“I fell in love with the EVPSA office two or three years ago when Moshin [Mirza] was in office,” she said. “He was able to incorporate lobbying and organizing tactics into the office.”</p>\n<p>If she’s elected, she said, she would bring those efforts back. In addition, she wants to add an office liaison to communicate with labor workers on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-24/external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs-forum-loudon-vs-morales/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-24/external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs-forum-loudon-vs-morales/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-24/external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs-forum-loudon-vs-morales/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-24/external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs-forum-loudon-vs-morales/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-24/external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs-forum-loudon-vs-morales/","id":2279,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[2278,2277,2276],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Eight A.S.

From bottom left to right, Jeike Meijer, Steven Ho, Justice Dumlao and Madeline Loudon.<em> Jose Ochoa, Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday night, Brooke Kopel, the candidate for A.S. president running with Campus United (CU), released a statement on Facebook denouncing the ballot measure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be very clear: students should not have to pay a penny more in student fees for a new UCen,” the statement said. “The UCen as it exists has so many problem [sic]: it’s old, crowded, and it needs renovation- just like tons of other buildings on our campus. This isn’t because student fees are too low, it’s because California refuses to invest in public education.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was released a couple of hours before voting officially opened on G.O.L.D. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Kopel said she wanted to be as transparent as possible with students and she believes that students pay the most attention right before voting starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why I wanted to release it at that point, not to get any last minute votes or as a way to put myself up in the elections, but rather to reach as many students as possible when they’re paying attention,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU executive candidates Sophia Dycaico, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), Madeline Loudon, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and Anthony Pimentel, the candidate for Internal Vice President (IVP), all confirmed they agree with Kopel’s statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico said she had always denounced the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. Both Dycaico and Kopel told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday they believed an official statement was necessary to dispel rumours that Campus United supported the “NewCen” measure as a party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many candidates support the renovation of the UCen; however, they disagree with raising student fees to complete the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that funding should be coming from the state and the UC system and should definitely not be placed as a burden on students,” Loudon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, the candidate for EVPLA with the Isla Vista Party, said that making students pay for the UCen sets a precedent for students paying for all on-campus renovations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates running for executive positions with the Isla Vista Party also confirmed they do not support the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of them denounced the project before election season began, including Justice Dumlao, the IVP candidate for A.S. president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I’m very glad that she finally is coming out in being against the NewCen project, I think it was just a little late,” Dumlao said. “I’m a little sad that it was late, but better late than never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he thought Kopel could have been more open about the fact that she was questioning her position on the NewCen project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that he believes Kopel might have felt she could not express her opinions on the ballot measure, as Hieu Le, the current A.S. President and main proponent of the “NewCen” project, ran with Campus United and is affiliated with the same party as Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to pin it all on Brooke… I imagine it’s very difficult to denounce something that your current elected president is doing,” Dumlao said. “‘Better late than never’ is how I feel. There’s so many other circumstances that Brooke could have been under or pressured under.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she took a stance on the ballot so late in the election season, Kopel said she wanted to gather as much information as possible before making a decision and said she felt as though new facts were coming out about the UCen proposal everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually wanted to wait as long as I could to hear the most opinions I could,” Kopel added. “That is my job, to understand everybody’s ultimate sentiments toward this project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayela Morales, the candidate for External Vice President for Statewide Affairs with the Isla Vista Party, also commented on the timing of Kopel’s statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a little disheartened to see Brooke coming out with the statement not because I don’t believe that she’s against it, but because students have been so vocal about it for a really long time,” Morales said. “I thought it was very strategic to post that right before voting started.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always ‘better late than never,’ but I honestly think it was a little too late for her to say that,” Morales added. “I think it was a little too strategic; she could have said that a long time ago.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Anthony Pimentel, a third-year political science major, is the candidate running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internal Vice President is responsible for presiding over Senate and advising the A.S. President on campus issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho and Pimentel currently serve as on-campus and off-campus senators respectively. As part of their responsibilities as senators, both also work with boards, committees and units (BCUs) and organizations on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the A.S. Senate website, Ho serves with A.S. Publications and Note Taking, Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and Queer Commission</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel works with the A.S. Food Bank, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) and Human Rights Board (HRB). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Tuesday’s debate:</span></p>\n<p><b>LARGEST INTERNAL PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho believes the largest internal problem in A.S. is a “lack of transparency between BCUs, senators and executives,” referencing the issues of procurement that occurred last fall when many members of Associated Students were not told what was happening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said that the biggest problem in A.S. is accountability. He wants to tackle this by expanding the role of the accountability chairs to “ensure that all senators are being held accountable.” </span></p>\n<p><b>LEGAL CODE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel believes that the legal code is the “foundation of the association.” While he believes it is tricky because it’s a fluid document, he says it also serves as a guide for everyone in A.S. and wants to make sure that all senators are aware of how to amend it to meet students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho cited his experience reading the legal code multiple times, saying that when he was first elected senator, he was the first person to write a bill to change the legal code “before other senators even knew what legal code was.” He believes the institutional knowledge he gained working as a senator will allow him to help fix the legal code, as it is currently “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><b>AD-HOC COMMITTEES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a co-chair of the Textbook Affordability Committee, Ho said he has “fostered the collaboration of the BCUs, the Student Initiative Recruitment and Retention Committee” to work on getting students involved in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel is currently a chair for the Mental Health Ad-Hoc Committee and worked on legislation earlier in the year to support students with mental health issues.</span></p>\n<p><b>A.S. WEBSITE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said the A.S. website should be an essential resource for students because the association is in charge of approximately $13 million of public money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho wants to have the association make their resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible to all students and public on the A.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><b>DIVISIONS IN SENATE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho spoke about his current experience in Senate, saying that he “knows what it feels like to have senators across the table dehumanize [him] and marginalize [him].” As IVP, he said he wants to make it clear that hate and personal attacks on other senators cannot and will not be tolerated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel spoke about wanting to effectively facilitate Senate and wants to ensure that “every single senator feels comfortable in the Flying A Room where Senate meetings take place.”</span></p>\n<p><b>CURRENT IVP:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said he believes the current IVP does a great job of keeping Senate organized and bringing people together. However, he wants to make himself more available and encourage one-on-one contact with all senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho also praised the current IVP’s ability to foster a collaborative environment in Senate, saying he’s been able to work on bills and initiatives across party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>MALE-DOMINATED VOICES IN A.S.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho recognized it is difficult for female-identifying senators to speak up, but said there are currently an equal number of male and female voices at the table. If elected as IVP, he wants to make sure to constantly remind everyone that every senator at the table has an opinion that should be valued and heard by everyone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel talked about how he has witnessed “mansplaining” in the organization numerous times and wants to create a culture of respecting everyone’s opinions.</span></p>\n<p><b>CONNECTIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel stressed the importance of having “positive, strong relationships” with student leaders and campus organizations as well as the administration in order to get work done. Pimentel personally worked with Marisela Marquez and Housing and Residential Services in his time as a senator and wants to continue to strengthen those relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said he was “heavily involved” in the demands for the RCSGD and the undocumented students’ demands for access to more resources. He said his involvement in these initiatives as well as with Campus Democrats has allowed him to make connections with administrators and student leaders on campus. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAVORITE RESOLUTION:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said his favorite resolution he authored was one that called for the resignation of the director of the RCSGD because the student staff felt the director was not meeting their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel’s favorite resolution he authored was a recent one condemning anti-semitism and hate speech on campus.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN INITIATIVE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said having the NewCen initiative on the ballot allows students to have the opportunity to vote on the project and have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho expressed strong opposition to the fact students would have to pay for the NewCen project. He said students already pay enough tuition as it is and that the university should be responsible for the costs of the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><b>CONTRASTS WITH OPPONENT:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said that as a senator, he was the first to write and pass a bill during his term. He stressed that his collaboration with BCUs and active presence at their meetings would help him in the position of IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel addressed his time management skills and work ethic. He talked about holding two jobs besides senator, but said he attended every senate meeting. He also emphasized his interest in speaking to and working with people who have a multitude of different perspectives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. election begins Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Party candidate for College of Letters &amp; Science Senator, gives listeners at The Hub her platform. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juan Ornelas and Nima Bencohen, from the Isla Vista Party and Campus United respectively, presented their transfer-specific goals at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates for Letters and Science senators from the Campus United party, Joshua Takeuchi, Allison Adam, Gabriella Shofet and Emily Quach, were present at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party put forth two candidates for the position of Letters and Science senators, Xochitl Briseño and Ricardo Uribe, who both attended the forum as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds to make opening remarks, which they used to introduce themselves, their majors, the party they were running with and the position they were running for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a breakdown of each candidate’s response to the questions presented at the forum: </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen wants to focus on expanding CLAS to upper division courses which he believes will benefit not only transfer students but all students at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas is interested in addressing complaints raised by transfer students about the lack of social interaction fostered between them. He wants to expand programs at the Transfer Student Center to make transfer students feel more at home at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said his platform is built upon reducing food insecurity on campus and making food more accessible. He wants to accomplish this by expanding the meal ticket program to make food available to all students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi said his main initiative is to set up a “comprehensive website” for student-run businesses that would allow students to gain experience that would prepare them to be competitive applicants in the job market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach wants to use her experience in the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) office and working for lobby corps to revamp GOLD after “being inspired by other UC’s and what their students are pushing for on their campuses.” Specifically, she wants to implement a class selection shopping cart to streamline the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants her first project as a senator to be reading the entire legal code so that she can “know it like the back of [her] hand.” She would also like to create an A.S. school supplies bank, similar to the A.S. Food Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet wants to create a website to connect students and researchers on campus to make research opportunities more accessible for undergraduate students because UCSB is “one of the world’s best research institutions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño considers the biggest problem at UCSB to be retention. She wants to “make sure that underrepresented communities have the resources they need to attend this school” and wants to form a committee dedicated to voicing student concerns to the administration. </span></p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT AT UCSB:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño referenced her involvement with grassroots movements since her first day at UCSB. She wants to be somebody who “amplifies student voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke about his involvement in Sigma Eta Pi, an entrepreneurship fraternity, and believes that his focus on technology will help him come up with “efficient ways to solve student issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe cited his work on Pride Week and in helping to put together the Drag Show this past week as an example of how he “knows diversity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized her experience working in the EVPLA office, where she helped put on workshops. She also cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator, where she gave students direct access to the local government and their programs, such as the CSO program or UCIV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach spoke about how her time in the EVPSA office gave her the opportunity to advocate against tuition hikes on the statewide level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen talked about his involvement with the Gift of Life finding donors for bone marrow. He also spoke about his experience with the Transfer Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas cited his work on student government at the community college he attended as well as his work as a Student Apartment Complex Coordinator.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet believes that dialogue of any kind is important to “bring communities together.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PROJECTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam spoke about “constantly reaching out to the administration” and giving the university a “well-thought out plan” with input from various different communities to give projects a fighting chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe emphasized his interest in carrying out a meal ticket program and believes that the biggest barrier to its execution is funding. He hopes to allocate the funds that A.S. has power over and work with the university to have an open dialogue about what the program would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen, speaking specifically about transfer students, said that one of the biggest problems is the diminished orientation program. He wants to work with the transfer orientation staff at the Office of Student Life to expand the program and pass a resolution within A.S. to allocate funding toward the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach brought up her plan to revamp G.O.L.D., stating that she would want to work with the UCSB administration and reach out to other UC campuses to collaborate with them and learn about similar projects that they’ve done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas referenced Bencohen’s initiative to make the transfer orientation program more comprehensive, stating that it was a goal of his as well. He said he would want to speak to the Transfer Student Alliance and the administration to talk about how the program can be better.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke again about his plan to create a “comprehensive website,” saying that he would pitch his plan to the administration and use his connections with them to market his plan to the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño spoke about wanting to be the voice of the students and cited her experience in grassroot movements on campus as beneficial for that.

She also wants to create a program for sexual assault awareness training, similar to the one all Greek life members undergo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to reach out to students in I.V. and on campus to make them aware of what A.S. does and what resources are available to them. She would also like to work with the police in I.V. to mediate student relations and advocate for survivor-oriented sexual assault policies.</span></p>\n<p><b>POLICE PRESENCE IN I.V.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes relying on UCIV, a volunteer group that offers assistance to partygoers during weekends, as student liaisons between students and police is the right step. She wants to move toward community policing because she believes the police presence in I.V. makes people uncomfortable.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to hold forums with police officers at least once a quarter to ease relations between students and officers. She also aims to create an environment where students feel comfortable reaching out to police for help.</span></p>\n<p><b>HALLOWEEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes Halloween in recent years has seen I.V. become a police state and said most people spend Halloween out of town. She wants to implement different events in I.V. so that students can enjoy Halloween in I.V. without partying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to work on opening up conversations, citing the CSD’s Deltopia Town Hall as an example of a productive discussion. She also wants to reach out to students who are usually not involved in these spaces and work with the CSD to ensure that student safety is the top priority. </span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator for the EVPLA office in which she was the liaison between the campus community and the CSD. She also helped the CSD implement a policy internship for students to give them experience in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer spoke about her work canvassing for Measures E and F as well as her experience in Campus Democrats, which allowed her to make connections with Congressman Salud Carbajal as well as Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico spoke about her plan to utilize the width of I.V. streets to implement slanted parking on one side and parallel parking on the other, which would open up many more parking spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to maximize the space in I.V. that is already available as well as work with the future A.S. President to make on-campus parking cheaper so commuter students avoid parking in I.V. and taking up spaces for I.V. residents. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-82643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pauley Track was “previously deemed unsuitable for competitive use and lacked adequate lighting,” according to the UCSB Department of Recreation’s website. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project began in the spring of 2017 and opened around early March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track was “in terrible shape” due to damage from tree roots, according to Jeff Huskey, director for the Department of Recreation at UCSB. He said the track was originally built in the 1950s and was officially named Pauley Track in 1974 after Edwin W. Pauley, who was a donor to several UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pauley Track was “previously deemed unsuitable for competitive use and lacked adequate lighting,” according to the UCSB Department of Recreation’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track was reconstructed several times but the tree roots were such a problem the track needed an entirely new structure, Huskey said. The most recent construction project is the first work that has been done on the track in recent years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Huskey, the track was in such bad shape that it had not been used to host an event since 2010. To fix the root problem, a root barrier was placed between the track and the surrounding trees. Lights were added to the track as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cost of the track renovation was approximately $2.6 million, according to Huskey. The costs were funded primarily through the “Flip the Switch For Student Recreation” student fee passed in 2013.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The remodeling of the track was one of the three phases in the remodeling of the athletic fields. The other phases were repairing Robertson Gymnasium and using artificial turf on the track, according to Huskey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track is open at approximately sunrise and closes around 11:30 p.m. The track is open specifically for UCSB students, but is still considered open to the general public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John McCutcheon, the director of intercollegiate athletics, welcomed everyone and thanked everyone who supported the “Flip the Switch” vote during the grand opening on Wednesday. He also thanked the Cheadle family and the Pauley Foundation for their financial support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brittney Johnson, a fourth-year on UCSB’s track team, expressed enthusiasm about the renovation to students, student-athletes and donors in attendance and thanked them all for their contributions. She told the crowd about how the team would practice on the previously unfit track and said it was a point of pride and an example of their work ethic to continue to practice in poor conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Practicing on the turf showed the resilience of this team,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice-chancellor of student affairs, also thanked the donors for putting together Wednesday’s event, which she said was “an unusual project with great leadership.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the event’s organizers cut the blue ribbon signaling the grand opening of the track, students joined by athletes led the way in the first lap since the track’s opening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track will be hosting its first event since its renovation next week against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Saturday, April 28.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/","id":2785,"author":{"id":226,"name":"Phillip Snoddy"},"related":[2784,2783,2782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"On-Campus Senator Candidates Talk Platforms","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/senators-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/senators-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Candidates running for on-campus senator positions on the A.S.

Active campaigning for all candidates began on Thursday.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the candidate’s priorities and plans if elected:</span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagpal wants to decrease indirect student costs and work to expand the Textbook Buyback Program so students get 80 percent of their money back. He would also like to work to install charging stations around campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina wants to implement a “backdoor” policy for C.A.P.S. which would allow students who might be visibly anxious to be able to come into C.A.P.S. without anyone seeing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon is interested in collaborating with the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) office and the Lobby Corps to fight tuition hikes and said he plans to write resolutions to support their efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malamed said he wants to ensure that students have access to feminine hygiene products and contraceptives in the residence halls so students are relieved of the burden of any additional costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to increase accountability and transparency on campus, Toubian wants quarterly teacher evaluations to be publicly posted so students can make informed decisions when picking classes. If there are recurring problems with a professor, Toubian said she wants students to be able to hold the administration accountable. </span></p>\n<p><b>CAMPUS SAFETY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon said people might not feel safe calling the police because they are worried about being penalized, but said he wants to increase students’ awareness of the policies that do not punish people reporting issues like drug or alcohol overdose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian wants to expand the Community Service Organization (CSO) escort system as she once waited alone for 45 minutes for a CSO officer. She said she also wants to create a shuttle service to and from I.V. in university-owned vans or buses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina wants to institute a shuttle system between the Santa Catalina residence halls and the main campus as well as provide carts or vehicles to CSOs so they can better help students get home safely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malamed said he wants to increase the number of on-campus students on the Sexual Assault Board and work with the Residential Housing Association to ensure students on campus feel safe reporting sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagpal said he wants more students living in the residence halls to know about resources like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education Center</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as expand the blue light system on campus and in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can vote in the A.S. election on G.O.L.D. from April 23 to April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

for sexual assault through “activism, advocacy, and survivor empowerment,” said Emily Umana, TBTN’s finance coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood, Counseling and Psychological Services and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center set up booths during the rally to give out buttons, coloring books and further information on their respective
