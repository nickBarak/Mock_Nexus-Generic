However, the amendment failed 11-9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP is currently working with legislative staff on AB 1620, which would expand eligibility for non-AB 540 undocumented students, according to Alcocer.

Approximately 5,000 nonresident students’ families have incomes of $58,000 or under, according to data provided by the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may19/b2attach4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Office of the President</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Students Association (USCA) was one of the loudest voices opposing the tuition increase.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_UCSA/status/1129102698769309697\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the Board of Regents Thursday, USCA President Caroline Siegel-Singh and University Affairs Chair Nuha Khalfay said they were in “strong opposition” to the proposed increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By making our institution more and more inaccessible for non-Californians, we are building a wall around our institution and pushing out anyone who did not have the privilege of living in California at the right time,” the two said in the letter.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

We can say, ‘This experience happened to me. I felt unsafe. Can you explain to me why it happened or can we talk about this to work it through?’” Meijer said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others who joined Meijer included leaders of community and campus groups including Students Against Sexual Assault, the Isla Vista Community Services District, the Black Students Union and Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA-elect for the 2019-2020 school year. Members of the EVPLA office were also present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No law enforcement representatives attended this meeting. Meijer said it was due to the meeting’s preliminary nature in setting up a base and not conducting any official business yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preliminary draft of the agenda for meetings has introductions and guidelines for 10 minutes, public comment for 30 minutes, discussion for 30 minutes, identifying steps for 10 minutes and closed session without police officers for 10 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer based the new Police Collaborative Board’s structure off of an original police collaborative board proposal left behind by 2015-2016 EVPLA Paola Dela Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those present at the meeting suggested edits to the list of potential members of the board, such as law enforcement officers, A.S. entities and property owners. Changes were also made to the sample agenda, along with the goals and structure of meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasizing restorative justice and community policing as goals for the board was among the recommended changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara initially had a “Student Safety Panel” headed by former Lieutenant Raymond Vuillemainroy of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), according to the original proposal from Dela Cruz. The purpose of the panel was to create a collaborative relationship with community members and student leaders through open dialogue, but it was dissolved in 2013 when Lt. Vuillemainroy left the IVFP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was substantial debate on whether the presence of police officers was necessary during public comment for future meetings. While safety was considered imperative for community members who cited personal experiences and grievances with police officers, Meijer found it equally important for police officers to be present to listen to safety concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees settled on a compromise: People will be able to speak at meetings or submit written anonymous comments on paper or through a Google Form. People can also choose to comment privately later in the meeting without the presence of police officers in a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A suggestion was made for the addition of a statement at the beginning of meetings stating police officers will not question people regarding their comments unless there is a present danger to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising and translating in other languages so that community members of different linguistic backgrounds can voice their concerns was proposed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Meijer is working to have the Police Collaborative Board added to A.S. Legal Code. The board would have to be voted and approved through A.S. Senate, according to Meijer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A finalized version of the proposal will be considered at the next collaborative board meeting on May 29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer hopes to have the structure prepared so the board is ready to begin official business by Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy, believes the board will be able to foster a better relationship between the community and law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the board’s goal is to make an open line of communication… I think that’s a good thing.

The <em>Daily Nexus</em> Editorial Board wrote that Ho “fails to show professionalism” during Senate meetings, seemingly forgetting that  ”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.”</span></p>\n<p>While Ho has maintained a more professional decorum at more serious Senate meetings, such as last month’s divestment meeting, in some ways, he has continued to act unprofessionally throughout his term.</p>\n<p>Ho has been involved with A.S. for all three of his years at UC Santa Barbara, beginning as a fellow in the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office during the 2016-2017 school year before being elected as an on-campus senator for the 2017-2018 year.</p>\n<p>Two main platforms Ho emphasized during his term were expanding the A.S. Fellowship and making A.S. more visible to undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“I think I was able to fulfill both, [but] not to the extent that I really hoped to do so,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho cited deputy chief of staff resignations in both A.S. President Brooke Kopel’s office and his own, beginning the year in a scramble.</p>\n<p>“Because of academic reasons, the deputy chief of staff I had the vision with had to resign before the actual year started. So I had to try really quickly to hire a new one … so basically our hopes for it were not intermingling with the new people that were appointed,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho said he took a more “proactive” role in attending meetings for various advisory boards that he said the IVP does not usually attend, including the UCEN Governance Board, A.S. Finance and Business Committee, Elections Committee and Student Fee Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, the IVP is required to attend meetings for the above listed committees, as well as the Calendar Committee, A.S. Commission on Public Safety, Transportation Alternatives Board, Parking Ratepayers Board and Tech and Media Services Committee, which Ho said he did not attend.</p>\n<p>Ho said he was “never contacted by the Calendar Committee,” “[didn’t] think [A.S. Commission on Public Safety] even had a chair this year,” didn’t know if Transportation Alternatives Board and Parking Ratepayers Board even existed and said the Tech and Media Services committee was “not existent this year.”</p>\n<p>Other responsibilities of the IVP, according to A.S. Legal Code, include ensuring honoraria is given to senators on time, ensuring a parliamentarian is hired for Senate proceedings and planning senator trainings during Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>While honoraria was issued on time during Fall Quarter 2018, the Honoraria Committee had problems meeting quorum, resulting in a late dispersal of honoraria during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>After the A.S. Parliamentarian, Morales, resigned earlier this year, Ho could not find a replacement after multiple attempts.</p>\n<p>Ho did plan required trainings for senators on topics including anti-Semitism and sexual violence, but A.S. Legal Code states these trainings must be completed by week six of Fall Quarter 2018; Ho delayed them to the first week of Winter Quarter 2019, citing attendance issues.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to invite an external organization to come talk to less than half the Senate. I didn’t want to waste their time, I didn’t want to waste our time. So the first week of winter quarter seemed the most practical, because we got higher attendance when that happened,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Through his work with certain committees, Ho worked alongside Finance and Business Chair Zion Solomon to extend more funding to various Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs).</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he and Solomon did an “excellent job” at reaching out to campus organizations to get funding through A.S.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why we ran out of money so quickly in the year; it was really hard when you have to turn down some groups that wanted funding.”</p>\n<p>“Traditionally A.S. runs out of money week five, week six of Spring Quarter, this year it was around week three, week four that we ran out of money,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“Other than allocating more money towards our OSL fund, and encouraging groups to go to BCUs for their funding sources [or] adjusting the A.S. Budget or maybe proposing a lock-in on top of what we already have for Finance and Business, there’s no other thing we can do.”</p>\n<p>Another goal Ho campaigned on as IVP was to make all Senate resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible on the A.S. website, but failed to do so due to an “outdated system.”<br>\n“The thing about editing the website, it’s super difficult because we run on an outdated system at Associated Students,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“A lot of communication disparity happened within that and I just never got that finished.”</p>\n<p>Ho’s leadership style centered on fostering a collaborative environment for senators divided along party lines, and “[controlling] the room when it needed to be controlled.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously party politics played a huge role in this year’s Senate, even a bigger role than I’ve ever seen in my years in A.S.,” Ho said. “So [I kept] that atmosphere loose when I need to foster a collaborative environment, but if it did get hostile… [I would make] sure people aren’t out of order.”</p>\n<p>“If you met those senators, they definitely do not like each other. So making sure that if there’s a chance they can collaborate with one another, and be loose and be friends, I have taken it this year.”</p>\n<p>Ho did not run for any A.S. position for the 2019-20 year, but instead hopes to “get more involved with my own communities I identify with.”</p>\n<p>Alli Adam, a third-year political science major currently serving as a Letters and Science senator, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/live-a-s-election-results-2019/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1557993045384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHk38ViiWD4JQuHfJNuFIEP6ua-w\">succeed</a> Ho for the 2019-20 school year</span>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Oftentimes, Meijer said she found it hard to check every box while also trying to “pass the baton” to the next person taking office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer noted two specific platforms she ran on last year — establishing an emergency housing grant and expanding parking in I.V. — which both progressed throughout her term but ultimately failed to completely flesh out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), Meijer constructed an outline for how an emergency housing grant would work but was not able to make it a reality. In the case of expanded parking, something that “basically every EVPLA has run on,” Meijer and her office were unable to resolve the problem — even after speaking with Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who told her there was little that could be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So when I talked to Joan Hartmann about [parking], she was basically saying the answer from county is that there’s no solution,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, other projects saw more success. Meijer’s term was highlighted by a common theme of community outreach and safety, evident by substantial progress in both areas through multiple projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of addressing sexual assault, Meijer participated in spearheading new sexual assault and survivor policies as well as bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Fall Quarter 2018, Meijer began working with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to help create a foundation for future events and projects throughout the year. Meijer worked with Associated Students (A.S.) On Campus Senator Zion Solomon and SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford to provide funding and support for the SASA Survivor Healing events and bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bystander intervention trainings, which later made their way to the A.S. Senate table as a resolution, was created to assist </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newly-appointed Interpersonal Violence Investigator Kovena Avila</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by educating students on “how to report a sexual assault, what the reporting process is, what it looks like and what your rights are,” according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer collaborated with law enforcement in other instances as well, such as working to develop a new police collaborative board, a previous campaign platform. By doing so, the collaborative board, which held its first meeting on May 13, will hopefully function to maintain open and “direct communication” between students and law enforcement, according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also hosted separate “eating events” with law enforcement during the year to continue fostering a better relationship between students and police. Meijer says the events — “Coffee with a Cop” and “Pizza with Police” — helped to provide students with information regarding road closures and parking restrictions during special events such as Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a hot-button topic in I.V., saw significant progress through Meijer and her offices’ combined efforts with the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After compiling data collected from a group walk through I.V. Fall Quarter 2018, the I.V. CSD and External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office released a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">street lighting report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which underscored areas where new lights are required and which current lights are in need of upgrades. Meijer says it will take more than “a couple of weeks” for work to begin, likely dragging the street lighting project through Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also collaborated with the Alcohol and Drug Program to provide </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overdose prevention trainings for students and community members</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. During the training, Meijer said attendees were instructed on how to properly distribute naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose. Although the event took place at a similar time to Deltopia, Meijer said it was actually planned months in advance, at the beginning of Winter Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Meijer is currently working to equip UCSB’s Community Service Officers with naloxone, as the drug is currently limited to local law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around Halloween of Fall Quarter 2018, “the EVPLA office and IVTU went to every house in I.V. and brought everyone a tote bag,” Meijer said. Within the tote bag, community members received cards which noted road closures, important phone numbers and relevant resources. The cards were written in both Spanish and English. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before her term ends, Meijer said she has two final events planned as EVPLA: a Beloved Community “common table” and a five-year anniversary of the 2014 shootings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 18, Meijer said community members will have the opportunity to gather at People’s Park for an event sponsored by the Beloved Community Project. The “common table” is similar to a small conference, according to Meijer. She said the “community-bonding” event is strictly about “breaking bread” and mingling with fellow community members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 23, the fifth anniversary of the 2014 I.V. shootings, Meijer hopes to bring back elements from the first anniversary in 2015, when students and community members walked through campus and I.V. and wrote messages on eight different chalkboards in honor of those who lost their lives or were injured. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our plan is to get those chalkboards duplicated… we’re going to have flowers and ask entities to donate bouquets,” Meijer said. After walking past Storke Tower and down Pardall Road, attendees will “stop at Remembrance Garden and leave the flowers on each of the six benches.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a liaison between the university and the surrounding community, Meijer’s involvement with various organizations and initiatives reflect just how many doors she and her office have their feet in — a vital component of the position of EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried my hardest but it was very humbling … hopefully my passion shows in my work and people can tell I was passionate through what I did,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, a third-year environmental studies major currently serving as an off campus senator, will succeed Meijer for the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Going in, she believed “people just knew what this office does… but in reality, I found out that besides going to Senate meetings and talking to various orgs, they had no idea what this office was.”</p>\n<p>She said her “biggest success” was kickstarting a plan to get the bike shop a permanent location on campus, a task she has been working on throughout the school year. Approximately $3 million is budgeted for the project so far, she said, noting that the bike shop is something that the majority of campus utilizes.</p>\n<p>Because the project is still in its early stages – Kopel presented the shop’s plans at Wednesday night’s Senate meeting – it will ultimately be up to President-elect Alison Sir to see the project through its entirety.</p>\n<p>In regards to the tuition hike, Kopel said she was “blessed” that the UC Regents listened to the students on lobby trips in that they decided not to raise in-state tuition for the 2018-2019 school year.</p>\n<p>She noted that she herself has gone on two different lobby trips over the past year, one to DC and another to the student lobby conference in Sacramento, lobbying for Pell Grant and Cal Grant expansion.</p>\n<p>Kopel also praised the work the EVPSA office has done <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-08/evpsa-position-will-remain-vacant-until-spring-elections-board-says/\">without an actual EVPSA</a> , highlighting its efforts with Coffee and Calls and on the several lobby trips throughout the year.</p>\n<p>She referenced the latest out-of-state resident tuition hike that was on the UC Regents’s table, noting that her office, in conjunction with the EVPSA office, “mobilized to get people out [there and] make it definitely aware that [the tuition hike] was happening.”</p>\n<p>She also met with UC President Janet Napolitano once a quarter, along with all of the other UC undergraduate student presidents, and said she was proud that during every single meeting, they “addressed tuition hikes and basic needs and college affordability.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about that every single time and made it aware to the [UC] president that the council of presidents won’t stand for anything less than making college more and more affordable.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the natural disaster relief fund, Kopel said she found it difficult to “navigate the administration” and what routes to take when looking for sources of money.</p>\n<p>She explained that during this past year, she rediscovered an A.S. Excellence Fund that had been created by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud during his time as president. The fund, made up entirely by alumni donations, was meant to be used for “bettering the academic experience of students.”</p>\n<p>The vague description means the fund can be put toward a large variety of uses, Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the fund has approximately $2,000 in it and has not yet been used. Kopel is currently working on getting more money into the fund so it can help students facing financial crisis from natural disasters in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’m really hoping that by the end of the quarter, we’ll be able to reach that $10,000 mark at the fund, and that at that point it will become an endowment and can start generating its funds,” she said. “Even if I don’t reach that $10,000 goal [by the end of the quarter]… Alison will be able to pick it up really easily next year.”</p>\n<p>In regards to helping sexual assault suvivors, Kopel referenced her work with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), stating that she did “a lot of work with them” in Fall Quarter 2018 by helping with the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/sasa-releases-list-of-asks-plans-to-approach-ucsb-administration/\">Asks</a> they put together.</p>\n<p>Aside from tangible projects, Kopel said she believed her role throughout the past year on this campus was to be visible, to help connect marginalized communities and those advocating on campus “with the people that they really need to get their efforts seen [by].”</p>\n<p>“When it comes to supporting communities and specifically the survivor community, there’s already so much work that’s going on that I don’t want to co-op or take credit for or change [what they’re doing] because they’re so strong.”</p>\n<p>Kopel said that as the first woman president in four years – with James Villarreal in 2015-2016, Austin Hechler in 2016-2017 and Hieu Le in 2017-2018 – she felt it was a “responsibility of mine” to do whatever she could to “be supportive and [be] there for survivors and for women.”</p>\n<p>She noted that she was proud of helping set up the Hate and Bias On Campus town hall.</p>\n<p>She further denounced Betsy DeVos’s proposed Title IX changes, stating there has to be “ample protections in place for survivors on UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>One of Kopel’s other platform points, one she referenced during her candidate forum, was “uniting the campus.” In that, Kopel said “uniting the campus,” for her, means “standing up for people who are unseen by this campus or underrepresented, or never heard enough.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve written letters for, spoke up for, gone to meeting with, spoken on a system wide level to the [UC] president [for underrepresented communities],” she said.</p>\n<p>“[I’ve gone] out to strikes, whether it be for AFSCMEor the Pan Asian Network, using my platform to uplift those voices that aren’t heard enough is a way to show as many people on campus as possible that these communities are in need, that these communities need support more than they’re getting.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nonpartisanship: </strong></p>\n<p>She praised the 69th Senate’s success in terms of the bills and resolutions passed; according to Kopel, this year’s Senate put out a “record number” of resolutions and bills, particularly in putting out resolutions that support “various communities” on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think Senate has definitely made it one of their priorities to make sure that they’re standing up for these students… I think there’s a few shining stars in Senate that have made work their priorities, but there’s a lot of others that kind of have been hidden under the brush.”</p>\n<p>But she noted the contentious situation that this year’s Senate brought: “Not only does it feel kind of tense and the air is really thick in there, but you can visually see a divide. You can tell who’s been elected by Campus United and you can tell who’s been elected from the Isla Vista Party.”</p>\n<p>Kopel attributed that fault and toxicity to both parties.</p>\n<p>“Partisanship and toxicity and harmful words and attacks get in the way of work we’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>Kopel was also tasked during her presidency with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">filling four vacant Judicial Council seats</a> – an unprecedented situation in recent UCSB student government history, and one that caused “uproar” within the Senate as Kopel presented her chosen appointments.</p>\n<p>“I was heavily affiliated with Campus United [at the time] and the Senate was split [on Judicial Council appointments], 50-50,” Kopel said, referencing the Judicial Council cases on the table at the time regarding her former party.</p>\n<p>“I think at first [the process] was hostile, but I think I did a very good job in being level-headed and open-minded and very open to their suggestions.”</p>\n<p>Kopel also noted that this past election season was more “hostile” than her year’s election had been, stating it was “really disheartening for me,” referencing, in her words, the “anti-Black” and “transphobic” comments made toward former A.S. presidential candidate Zion Solomon on a UCSB Reddit thread.</p>\n<p>“I know elections get really tense. I’ve been through two of them myself and I know people want to win, they want to help this campus, they want to represent students, but that should never come at the expense of someone else’s safety… It’s one thing to critique a platform and it’s another thing to hate on someone’s identity.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the “hostile” nature of elections, Kopel said she has “mixed feelings” about the presence of political parties on campus. While she believes the parties provide platforms for people who “might not have the means otherwise to run for positions,” ultimately, “the negatives outweigh the positives.”</p>\n<p>“Our campus is just a little microcosm of what our federal system looks like –– even though, by no means, is CU or IVP Democrat or Republican –– just having that split from having two parties lends itself to toxicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>“It lends itself to a divide that might not necessarily have to be there if everyone had to run independent or if there was some sort of system where there had to be more than two parties involved.”</p>\n<p>She also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-30/associated-students-ivp-and-evpsa-elect-removed-from-isla-vista-party/\">touched lightly on her departure from Campus United</a> during Fall Quarter 2018, stating that while she did as much as she could to communicate that departure with the student body, it was ultimately hard to address her departure because parties “aren’t really supposed to be present throughout the course of the year,” as stated in A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p><strong>What Comes Next?</strong></p>\n<p>Kopel will be attending law school at the University of Southern California after she graduates with UCSB’s class of 2019. She hopes to become an immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p>She said her time in the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), working as a caseworker during her second year at UCSB, was where she “found [her] voice for advocacy.”</p>\n<p>“I was able, as a caseworker, to see the impact I was able to have just on a small scale, but also on such a big scale on individual’s lives… my passion for advocacy has only grown since then.”</p>\n<p>But it was the presidential office in particular that “showed me that advocacy doesn’t necessarily mean having some huge movement accomplished. For me to be a successful advocate it doesn’t mean that I step into the game and get all the demands put through,” emphasizing that, to her, advocacy means “being visible and knowing that people are there for you.”</p>\n<p>In regards to her successor, Sir, Kopel said she hoped to make Sir’s transition into office easier that her own: “The transition was really scary for me. I felt really alone at first… a big priority of mine this year was to try and bridge the gap of transitions that we face every year.”</p>\n<p>But aside from the transition, Kopel’s advice for Sir is: “You have the utmost privilege of serving in this office, of meeting administration and cultivating relations with people you had no idea existed, communities you had no idea existed. Take advantage of literally every email that comes your way, every opportunity that comes your way, get to know this campus in and out.”</p>\n<p>“Treat every day like it’s your first, because it’s never too late to start something new.”</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

She said the physical space within Associated Students (A.S.) Main in the Multi-Cultural Center was in poor condition and lacked the supplies needed to do casework effectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming in and realizing all of these things … the person who assumes this position has to really care about students and want to do it,” Martinez said in an interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of immediately beginning the projects she planned for her term, Martinez said she first “had to take a huge step back” and “really pick apart the foundations” in order to improve the general functioning of the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I settled into the position in the summer, that’s when I realized that this office needed to be number one, the foundation needed to be fixed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fundamental part of this was rewriting A.S. Legal Code for the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) in order to better reflect the needs of students. Martinez said she changed the former divisions of casework within the office from Academic, Housing, Code of Conduct and Public Interest to consolidate some categories and create new divisions, which are now Grievances, Conduct and Academic and Financial Aid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this new organization of divisions fostered a more streamlined approach to case handling, in addition to making the process more intuitive for students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewriting Legal Code also included taking out the polling analyst project that was added the year before by Tannenbaum. Martinez said that the project’s execution did not reflect the initial vision or the needs of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In terms of the execution and the survey questions and everything, there wasn’t really anything there,” Martinez said. “Those questions that they had spent the whole year working on, I didn’t see how they would it would directly benefit this office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her term, Martinez also began a project to create a database of past cases that were previously filed physically. Now, the office files all cases online, and the next S.A.G. will be able to use that database to observe patterns in the data of the cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped to create a new logo for the OSA, which she said would help with outreach and better reflect the services of the office. She also noted that her office was more active on social media compared to her predecessor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Martinez did not have updated office hours for Spring Quarter 2019 available on the website, which she said was due to ongoing construction of the website. Office hours for Spring Quarter were also not readily available on the S.A.G.’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez collaborated with other UC campuses’ OSAs throughout the year to inform some of her projects for her term as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot of close communication to the other campuses and seeing how their student advocate offices work and what works well for them and what doesn’t.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, conversations with UC San Diego inspired Martinez to create an online appointment system for the office, similar to the one she had seen at their campus. The project is still in progress, but Martinez said she hopes it will make the office more accessible and user-friendly to students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped lift a project off the ground that had been floating in the office for some time: moving OSA office to the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. The idea was something Robin Unander, the attorney for A.S., introduced to Martinez, and now something that Martinez hopes to pass on to the new S.A.G.-elect, Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move aims to provide a more secure and confidential place for students to air their grievances, cases or concerns with OSA staff. Martinez’s case workers began holding office hours in the Pardall Center beginning in Spring Quarter 2019. The case workers from OSA literally worked alongside Undocumented Student Services and other legal services to create a more centralized space for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this quarter has focused on the logistics of moving the office, but she hopes that the OSA will be operating its services from the Pardall Center and the current space in A.S. Main will be used for administrative tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said a goal of hers for this year was to advocate for historically underrepresented and silenced students on campus. One way she addressed this was through her hiring decisions within the office. Martinez said she intentionally hired staff that came from different communities, clubs and cultural groups in order to better reach those people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, Martinez said the staff in OSA created a more welcoming place for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who I hired in the office are definitely a lot more understanding of the students who come in and they know how to talk to them better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her own background, as well as her work in various roles on campus, including as an A.S. senator in the 2017-2018 school year, helped her better understand students alongside her caseworkers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just know what it feels like to need help and not know where to go,” Martinez said. “Because of our background and experiences, I feel like a lot of people are more willing to go to great lengths to make sure that student is helped, that a student gets what they need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this aspect of her office is an improvement over Tannenbaum’s, citing that her office was more efficient in completing casework. Martinez said her office completed around 60 cases over the course of the year, but she noted that a lot of helping students involved giving guidance, talking things over and resolving problems that didn’t necessitate an officially documented case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez initiated significant projects during her term and followed through with a handful of the platform promises she made during her campaign. She had hoped to collaborate more with other groups on campus to specifically address student needs, but she said the conditions of the office that she inherited required more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Martinez at times failed to be completely transparent with the student body. Martinez <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\">withdrew from classes during Fall Quarter 2018</a>, but never came forward about withdrawing until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported the withdrawal in Winter Quarter 2019. Concerns about Martinez’s eligibility for the position erupted soon after, but ultimately, A.S. Legal Code proved inconclusive on whether or not an A.S. executive could serve while not enrolled in classes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her decision to withdraw was a hard one to make and that she withdrew on the final day of the quarter –– something Martinez said proves she was still a student and able to serve her constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like I took a break from the quarter. It’s not like I was completely absent,” Martinez said. “I was still very much involved in everything and doing everything I had to do.”</span></p>\n<p>She later explained in a message that she initially withdrew because she “had experienced ongoing incidents of interpersonal violence… I was involved in circumstances prompting the involvement of CARE and Title IX.”</p>\n<p>“Working through the trauma and healing from the violence made focusing on academics nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, at the end of her term, Martinez wants to pass on her remaining projects to her successor and some advice, as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have people who work in your office who care about students and that are represented in different communities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez echoes some of her previous goals for her term in her advice to Nguyen, but also encourages Nguyen to embrace that some of the best work is the work that sets up others to be successful as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our whole office has done a lot of work to make sure that this office is successful in the long run and so I would just encourage Nguyen to kind of do the same.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Martinez said the next S.A.G. needs to be dedicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just make sure that you really care about the work that you’re doing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [5/20, 9:53 a.m.]: This article was updated to include further statements from Martinez regarding her withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GND intends to massively invest in clean energy and infrastructure, transforming the American economy and decarbonizing the energy sector, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a representative for New York’s 14th congressional district, proposed the program in February 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB students Rose Strauss, Maithilee Kanthi and Claire Muñoz established Sunrise SB in January 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three have since coordinated with organizations such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 and the United States Youth Climate Strike, as well as elected officials such as U.S. Congressman Salud Carbajal and California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall opened with statements from County Supervisor Das Williams and Wendy Motta, a spokesperson for Carbajal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lead co-author of the Senate Bill 350 Clean Energy &amp; Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, Williams commended California for revamping its energy sector even as the country has stagnated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[California is] massively decarbonizing our energy sector. We’re getting better at using solar and other alternatives. However, the urgency of the situation is real, because even as California and some other states have moved forward, the country has not,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motta emphasized Carbajal’s enthusiasm for the GND.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was impressed by the aggressive agenda. He called Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and told her that he would like to be an original co-sponsor of the measure,” Motta said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the opening statements, the floor was opened for questions. The panel of four speakers included first-year environmental studies major Elena Salinas O’Toole, fourth-year sociology major Daniel Berchenko, Santa Barbara co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Per Kristian and campaign manager for Jill Stein during the 2012 presidential election and UCSB sociologist Ben Manski. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They addressed questions regarding how common citizens could become involved in the movement, the subject of reparations, the specific policies of the GND and its intersectional nature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski elaborated on how the different approaches to the GND come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s the liberal version which is technocratic, and focuses on a technological shift, there’s the progressive version which in my mind is the one that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done such a great job of articulating, which deals with the need to transition economically, and focuses on specific industries, and then there’s the green party one, which is systemic reform,” Manski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski emphasized the necessity of voting rights and election reform in order to democratize the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristian then highlighted the GND’s approach to mobilizing disenfranchised workers in middle America, similar to the original New Deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you think of a better way to get working people on board than putting people to work doing the work that we need to do to … rebuild our environment?” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berchenko spoke on the technological feasibility of the GND and how solutions already exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The technological fixes have existed for decades. We know that we have the solar capacity, the wind capacity, the hydroelectric capacity to transition from carbon. We know that we have the alternative technologies that we’re going to need to do this. The only thing that we seem to be lacking is the political will,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular significance to Salinas O’Toole is the stance that the GND takes with regard to wilderness and open spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I grew up in DC and there we have Rock Creek Park which is polluted and disgusting and for most people that’s the only nature that they’ve ever been exposed to. It’s gotten to the point where, in our society, it’s a privilege to have access to wilderness and I think that’s intrinsically wrong,” Salinas O’Toole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that is at the core of not understanding what’s at stake and preventing the people’s movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel went on to describe how one could become involved in activism and grassroots movements to avoid succumbing to despair and apathy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of that is find a group. Don’t sit at home scrolling through Facebook reading about walruses throwing themselves off of cliffs … it’s a never-ending stream of negativity and you’re just gonna spiral down a hole,” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salinas O’Toole emphasized the necessity of having organizations that listen to youth and give them a voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was something that I was battling with a lot. I’d go to protests and I felt like I was super involved, but then there’d be this huge lack of response. Having platforms for young people to take hold of this issue that is affecting our generation more than any other generation is critical I think,” Salinas O’Toole said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the conclusion of the town hall, members in the audience were asked what they hoped would come out of the GND; people listed water use regulations, job guarantees, environmentally friendly investment opportunities and improvements in air quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Berchenko said the two sides in the debate are not conflicts between urban and rural or liberals and conservatives, but rather the common person and corporate interests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Santa Barbara county there are five major oil projects going on right now. They are rebuilding the Plains All American Pipeline which spilled in 2015, on the same route, right next to it,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the people that are actually working that are being affected and that are going to be harmed by environmental issues, versus the small number of corporations and executives that are polluting the world. We can trace 70% of all emissions, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, to 108 companies, 100 of which are still in operation. It’s always been the same people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Berchenko is hopeful about Sunrise Movement SB and the chance for change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of what’s exciting about Sunrise and what’s exciting about the opportunity that’s presented to us now is that a large number of very young people are getting involved in this for what’s potentially the first time. They were really galvanized by the 2016 election and by the political climate that we’re starting to see now,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited about the history that it invokes and what it could be.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The fee needed approval from 60% of voters in order to pass — or so A.S. Elections Board thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria, Elections Board noticed a “discrepancy” between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code following elections night.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the AS 2018-2019 Constitution, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through a vote of senate need at least ⅔ of the votes to pass,” Renteria said in an email. “In Elections Code, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through the vote of the senate need 60%.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution is the superior law within A.S., the 64.93% of “yes” votes that SIRRC received was not enough — SIRRC needed two-thirds of the vote, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC could not be reached for comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This discrepancy between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code has not always existed, however. Students voted to make the 60% to two-thirds, or 66%, change to the A.S. Constitution in 2017, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time, Renteria said, the percentage change was made to the A.S. Constitution but not to Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, if a new fee is put on the ballot by a vote of the A.S. Senate, two-thirds of the vote is needed for the adoption of the fee. Since the SIRRC fee was put on the ballot by a Senate vote, and not by a petition, this two-thirds requirement applies to the SIRRC fee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution change was in 2017 and no new fees were put on the 2018 Spring Quarter Elections ballot, Elections Board did not discover this discrepancy until after the 2019 Spring Quarter elections, Renteria said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discrepancy was brought to A.S. Senate’s attention during last week’s Senate meeting, since the 2019 Spring Quarter A.S. Elections results were on the agenda. However, Senate was unable to ratify the results, since not enough senators showed up to the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum on May 8, Renteria informed A.S. Senate that the SIRRC fee did not pass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators were then given the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, and by the end, a few senators said they agreed with Elections Board’s right to interpret the election results the way they did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo said that if SIRRC had an issue with interpretation, SIRRC could file a complaint with Judicial Council. On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal cited A.S. Legal Code, which states that Elections Board has jurisdiction over all election rules and policies and has the power to interpret the Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi addressed the discrepancy during A.S. Senate’s public forum as well; however, she had differing views from Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Parts of legal code says you need 60%, and then other parts of legal code say you need 66%, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so, what you guys need to decide amongst yourselves is … whether or not you’re going to go with the 60% or 66%, and each part of legal code says something different about that,” Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My suggestion for you guys is to open a special election … You do have the ability to either affirm it or ratify or do whatever you want with it, regardless of what the student vote was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Renteria indicated that only Elections Board could interpret the results and that the interpretation is not up for debate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked whether Elections Board has the final say in interpreting elections results, Safadi said in a message that “Elections Board has a say on how elections code is interpreted in relation to that fee, as does the attorney general’s office on how to interpret legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, it is Senate who possesses the most power in determining the course of action following all the information presented to them (i.e. do they want to have a special election for that fee?),” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi said during public forum that since new fees usually fail, there is no precedent for this exact situation.

Doan also cited an AFSCME-led </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boycott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of commencement speakers last month, during which the union called for workers to protest events featuring speakers such as former First Lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear AFSCME leaders are going to desperate lengths for attention, from sporadically announcing baseless accusations against the university to calling for a boycott of commencement speakers that squarely hurts students and their families,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan added that UC health and service workers receive fair compensation and benefits for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC already pays AFSCME patient care and service workers at or above market rates, with excellent health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lybarger expressed her discontent with the UC system, accusing it of siding with the most economical option, a decision that she said negatively affects union employees who risk having their jobs outsourced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC administrators have opted for a publicly financed race to the bottom, which will come at the expense of patients, students, families, and our communities,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The May 16 strike will take place throughout the entire state on all 10 UC campuses and at all five medical campuses.

The governance board then agreed to the 35 new bike spaces in an updated design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we would have liked to have gotten more, we felt like the 35 was a good compromise between having bike parking for students and having [bike parking] available in the safest way possible, in addition to meeting their needs for programming as well,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original design plan included renovations of five major areas, which includes the lawn directly in front of the SRB, empty space in front of Parking Lot 22 and the bike path which runs between these two areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the SRB Governance Board was notified by the Campus Planning Committee within the UCSB Office of Budget and Planning at the end of 2018 that the scope of their design was not possible, according to Velasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We found out that the school has future plans for pretty much 80% of the area we wanted to renovate, so now we’re only renovating a very small portion of land that’s right in front of the SRB,” Velasco said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88071\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88071\" data-attachment-id=\"88071\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/bike-committee-opposition-does-not-change-srb-design-plans/ucsb-srb-north-gathering-space_conceptplan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=888%2C575&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88071 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=888%2C575\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SRB North Landscaping Design Project design from May 2018. Only Area 4 is part of the current design.<em> Courtesy of Annie Golay and Ricardo Uribe</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the project was minimized, new bike parking was removed altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we needed to act fast because we felt that bike parking is a huge problem on campus and our job as a committee is to make sure we have appropriate infrastructure and bike parking available for students, because bike parking is such a vital part of our campus,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Bike Committee wrote a second letter to the SRB Governance Board on March 1, spoke to board members at multiple meetings and helped draft the A.S. Senate resolution that passed last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ricardo Uribe serves as both a Letters and Science Senator as well as a board representative for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. He believes that the student support from the resolution did not change the outcome of current design plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously that resolution shows that there was some sort of need for this space … I think that the resolution didn’t have an effect that it attended to,” Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last Friday’s SRB Governance Board meeting, three different propositions for the design project were presented: either add bike parking, wait until other future projects planned by the university for the area were completed or move forward with the SRB Design plan without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board voted 11-2 to move forward without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two board members who voted in favor of bike parking are both affiliated with A.S.: Alexis Xa, the A.S. representative on the SRB Governance Board, and Uribe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golay, who spoke at Friday’s governance board meeting, believes the current amount of bicycle parking is insufficient and causes a safety threat to students going to the SRB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have to pass all these bike lanes to get to the SRB, it is really dangerous, and that lot is already over-subscribed,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think the safest and best option is to include at least a few bike parking spaces at the SRB, because currently none exist, and we’re concerned about the safety and needs of students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main priority of the SRB Governance Board, according to Velasco, was to begin work as soon as possible on the SRB North Landscape Design Project. If bike parking was added, a new redesign would be required, pushing the project back by another year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 7, the SRB Governance Board will vote to approve the final cost of $560,000 for the project. If this measure passes, construction will begin in summer 2019.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Signa filed his own lawsuit against former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson in November 2018. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit makes several allegations against current and former members of UCPD, including former Chief of Police Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief of Police Cathy Farley, Lieutenant David Millard, Lieutenant Mark Signa, Lieutenant Robert Romero, Officer Tiffany Little, Officer Michael Little and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Smith was consistently retaliated against by UCPD staff for bringing attention to concerning practices and behaviors within the department. Some of Smith’s concerns included alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, of fellow officers and of sexual assault and rape victims, as well as falsifying sexual assault reports and racial discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit is the most recent of the three to be filed. It alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the plaintiff in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">case against UCPD filed in November 2018, consistently retaliated against Smith. Smith allegedly brought repeated grievances about Lieutenant Signa and other officers’ behavior to former Chief Olson, but court documents state Smith “has continued to be the target of harassment and retaliation” – even after resigning from the department in November 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, court documents allege that Smith participated in a “Good Ole Boys’ Club” within the department, which allegedly fostered and condoned misconduct, favoritism, harassment and retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final of the three suits filed against UCPD since November is from Officers Tiffany and Michael Little, spouses working within the department. According to court documents, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pair alleged that they were retaliated against after reporting Smith for allegedly having an extramarital affair with a subordinate officer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three cases referenced specific events in which the officers were both involved but alleged different circumstances and details on what exactly happened. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent case filed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smith alleges that Officer Signa, Officers Tiffany and Michael Little and Officer Hashimoto “engaged in relentless acts of defamation of character and false light” and “have created and promoted a narrative within the UCPD and surrounding law enforcement agencies” about Smith’s resignation and integrity as an officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case also alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the Littles and other officers “conspired” against Smith by making a personnel complaint against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith resigned near the end of 2017 due to alleged “ongoing harassment and retaliation” and UCSB’s “inaction” in response to the conduct, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations in Smith’s case against UCPD date back to 2014, shortly after Smith was hired in the department, according to court documents. Below are the specific allegations the case makes against individual UCPD officers and the department as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lieutenant Mark Signa </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that since the start of Smith’s employment in August 2012, a group of officers have “consistently failed to leave the station for nearly entire shifts and spent most nights at the station playing video games, watching movies, and/or browsing the internet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa allegedly participated in these activities and showed “inappropriate ‘Youtube’ videos to the squad.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sergeant, Smith allegedly “gave clear directives that officers were to stay out of the station, not to watch TV or movies or play video games on duty,” court documents state. In response, Lieutenant Signa allegedly “scoffed” at Smith’s directives and posted “multiple colored photocopies of [World War II-era] General Patton throughout [the] station” with Smith’s name on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly requested multiple trainings in the time span between 2015 and 2017, but “Signa denied all of these requests, while consistently allowing other sergeants to attend courses,” court documents allege. When Smith asked about this, Lieutenant Signa allegedly said Smith was “developed enough” and that the “Department did not need to spend any money” on Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around April 2015, amid “scrutiny regarding the handling of sexual assault cases,” the department allegedly took reports in which “males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department also allegedly took reports “where victim’s statements were being exaggerated to meet elements of a crime.” Signa allegedly ordered that officers continue “classifying all males as suspects in any sex-related case, whether or not a crime had occurred.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly expressed concern that this practice was “libelous” and did not adhere to “standard and appropriate law enforcement procedures, and potentially violated due process.” Signa allegedly “became upset” with Smith and told him to “let the district attorney figure out who is guilty and who is not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa also allegedly said “UCPD could not afford the political scrutiny.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD members also allegedly created a “secret log” for sexual or domestic violence cases, which all officers in the department had access to. Officers were allegedly “not to disclose knowledge of this log within their reports to avoid discovery.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported concerns of the secret log to Olson and Farley. Olson allegedly said he would “look into” the concerns. Court documents say this secret log still exists within the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of 2016, Signa allegedly ordered Smith to continue training “an African American officer, despite the fact that the Officer was not meeting the training standards.” Signa allegedly said “it was a politically sensitive matter because the officer was black,” citing Olson’s desire for greater diversity in the department. Smith allegedly reported Signa’s statements to UCPD staff, but no action was taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2017, Smith was allegedly assigned to a “mutual aid response” at UC Berkeley for the upcoming campus appearance from Milo Yiannopoulos. While at the event, UC Berkeley police officers allegedly “refused to allow the officers assisting from various U.C. Police Departments” to intervene with “students and civilians [who] were being brutally beaten by the anarchists.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the events at UC Berkeley and his concerns to Olson and was questioned by Olson upon his return from UC Berkeley. Olson allegedly “received a call from U.C. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett,” who yelled at Olson and was “furious” with Smith for voicing concerns regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further incidents regarding Signa can be viewed on pages 5 through 10 of the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Ryan Hashimoto </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smith served as sergeant for UCPD, he allegedly “reported several violations of policy and law to Signa,” which continued to create points of retaliation against Smith. Some of those violations pertained to Officer Hashimoto’s alleged misconduct in the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto allegedly “made multiple cartoon videos” of officers, crime victims, citizens, university officials and employees in which he “used his own voice to play the character of each person.” At times, the videos “were discriminatory toward several protected classes of persons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto allegedly created a video depicting an officer in the department – referred to as “Officer M” in the complaint – who was known to allegedly contact “female sexual assault victims unsolicited,” as well as sexual assault advocates from the Women’s Center. The video allegedly “depicts the advocates yelling ‘Rape!’ at the victims and forcing the victims to make sexual assault reports.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly reported Officer M to Signa after Smith discovered that “Officer M was having sexual assault advocates call his personal phone directly to report cases” without notifying a dispatch or supervisor. Smith ordered Officer M to stop this practice. UCPD allegedly took no action regarding Officer M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto’s alleged videos also depicted Chancellor Yang with Officer Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.” Hashimoto also allegedly mocked an African-American dispatcher through “videos and in person impersonations.” Hashimoto’s alleged impersonations of the dispatcher included mockery of the dispatcher “speaking and eating food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another occasion, Hashimoto allegedly acted out “a fictional situation where the dispatcher was playing with a large black dildo that Hashimoto named ‘King Kong Dong.’” Officer Hashimoto allegedly “often walked into different areas of the UCPD and would yell ‘King Kong Dong’ while impersonating the dispatchers voice. He would position his forearm in front of his groin area, and then slap his arm on desktops as if he was slapping a dildo on the desktop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto also allegedly “inappropriately joked” and stated to UCPD staff “that the victim in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/rape-2014-daniel-chen-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Chen rape and kidnap case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contracted herpes from the suspect,” while UCPD was conducting the investigation. Officer Hashimoto allegedly “mocked the victim’s Asian accent, and in the accent stated: ‘I have herpes on my pussy.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2018, while Smith was working in Montecito following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, he was shown a recording allegedly made by Hashimoto in which Hashimoto was verbally “mocking an evidence video and audio recording” related to the sexual assault, sodomy, kidnapping and robbery case of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Patrick Galoustian</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this video – a tape of Galoustian allegedly “sexual[ly] assaulting a transvestite victim” – Hashimoto allegedly mocked Galoustian’s accent in a voice-over, made sexual references to the victim and made “statements in essence of rubbing their (Galoustian and the trans victim’s penis’ together).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the video to UCPD on Jan. 27, 2018. At the time, Olson and Lieutenant Millard allegedly confirmed that they were “aware of the recording.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Tiffany Little and Officer Michael Little </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also reported alleged misconduct from married UCPD officers Tiffany and Michael Little, who “frequently left their assigned patrol areas while on duty and traveled to their personal residence in Goleta using UCPD vehicles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Littles would also allegedly “stay at their residences for extended periods of time, fail to answer calls for service, and ask other officers to handle calls for service for them.” The suit alleges that the Littles’ actions “are a violation of policy and a theft of funds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, Officer Michael Little also allegedly “talked about his fantasy to have a black man try to steal his wallet so he can ‘fucking shoot him in the fucking face.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Michael Little allegedly approached Smith and other officers and “related a fictitious story about how he (Little) is walking through a parking lot and a black man approaches him and tries to rob him of his wallet. Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would then allegedly “slightly draw his firearm from the holster as if he was going to draw his weapon” while reciting the story. Little allegedly “acted out this fantasy, by telling the story” while he was instructing at the firing range and “fir[ed] his duty weapon multiple times” at the shooting target. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported Little’s actions to Signa, but “Signa dismissed the claims against Michael Little and Hashimoto as ‘blowing off steam.’” The suit alleges that “Signa deliberately failed to take any action to further investigate the claims against Tiffany Little because of his personal relationships with these officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit further alleges that “Signa conspired with Michael Little, Tiffany Little, and Hashimoto to knowingly file false accusations of misconduct against [Smith] in the form of a personnel complaint,” resulting in an Internal Affairs investigation into Smith and an administrative leave that lasted over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly “requested an internal investigation into the false accusations made against him.” As of late March 2019, UCPD has allegedly “failed to investigate the officers who made false allegations against” Smith, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Smith’s resignation at the end of 2017, Signa allegedly told UCPD staff that Smith resigned “in bad standing, to avoid termination.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly demanded “for the harassment, retaliation, and first amendment violations to cease, no less than ten times since his departure from UCPD” in person to Olson, Farley and Lieutenant Millard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university allegedly “hired an attorney to investigate” Smith’s complaints, the Littles allegedly “briefed and debriefed several individuals before and after interviews” relating to the investigation and “attempted to recruit members of UCPD” to make complaints against Lieutenant Millard and Olson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Smith “continues to suffer losses in earnings and other employment benefits as well as past and future non-economic injury.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Horton, Smith’s lawyer, wrote in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith attempted to address significant misconduct relating to Lt. Mark Signa, Officer Michael Little, Officer Tiffany Little, and Officer Ryan Hashimoto. These individuals have responded by attempting to destroy Mr. Smith’s personal and professional reputation.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Smith was forced to take legal action after the University did not take any corrective action against the aforementioned individuals,” Horton said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the university “is undertaking a thorough review” of allegations and that they expect the police department “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to adhere to the highest of standards.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A case management conference for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is scheduled for Wednesday, July 31 at 8:30 a.m. </span></p>\n<p>The court documents in full can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_03_27_JOHN-DOE_COMPLAINT-FOR-DAMAGES.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Other officers also allegedly “confided” their concerns about Smith in Signa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa expressed concern about the “impropriety” of favoritism in the department and was later allegedly retaliated against at a lunch in or around August 2016. Sergeant Romero “attacked Signa’s position as Patrol Lieutenant, stating that the other sergeants were upset with Signa’s leadership style and were contemplating a vote of no confidence in Signa,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the lunch, Lieutenant Signa allegedly met with each of the six sergeants, excluding Sergeants Romero and Smith, during which “none of the sergeants expressed discontent with Signa’s leadership” or the intention to “submit a vote of no confidence against Signa,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after, Signa was “transferred from Patrol Lieutenant to Administrative Lieutenant,” which was seen as “punishment against Signa for not ‘falling in line’ with the ‘Good Ole Boys’ Club,’” court documents state.</span></p>\n<p><b>The 2017 Internal Affairs Investigation </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In or around September 2017, court documents state that UCPD Corporal Tiffany Little “submitted a letter of complaint alleging improper and possibly unlawful conduct by Smith.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are allegations that were included in the complaint, according to court documents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly had “an extra-marital affair” with a subordinate UCPD officer; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith “covered up” for an automobile accident in which the subordinate officer was driving a UCPD vehicle on campus;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was involved in an alleged hit-and-run automobile accident in which he “hit a parked car” with a UCPD vehicle;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used police lights and sirens “to get through heavy traffic” in order to attend “a free breakfast,” while visiting UC Los Angeles;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used UCPD resources to visit the subordinate officer in Santa Cruz;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Little, with her husband UCPD Officer Michael Little, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">also filed a suit against several members of the UCPD on March 29 on similar charges</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard was allegedly tasked with investigating this complaint and shared concerns with Signa “about how the IA investigation might affect his friendship with Smith,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on leave in or around the middle of 2017 and by the end of that year received a job at the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olson, Farley and Millard allegedly said during several meetings that “having Smith get the alternate position was the easiest solution to the issues the department was facing,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that the “woefully inadequate” investigation was closed right before Smith left UCPD toward the end of 2017 so the investigation would “not impede his ability to get the job” at the Office of Emergency Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was also allegedly treated to “a celebratory farewell lunch” and continued to have lunch with Olson, Millard and Romero after leaving the department. </span></p>\n<p><b>Signa’s Concerns and Alleged Retaliation: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly reported concerns about Smith and overall UCPD “propriety” to Olson and Farley.

The alleged retaliations included: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “key meetings” essential for Signa’s job duties; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not being able to email Olson without notifying Farley as well and receiving criticism for not adequately communicating with Olson; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bullying, harassing, publicly criticizing and blaming Signa in front of other officers and for unfounded reasons”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory meetings with Farley to “check-in,” in which “Signa received contradictory directives and conflicting information”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from UCPD social events;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Resistance” from Olson to meet in private with Signa;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “leadership, promotional and learning opportunities”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to resign early. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>University Response</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa filed a complaint with Human Resources in or around May 2018 about “his departmental concerns and the retaliation he faced for trying to voice them.” Signa met with Cynthia Señeriz, the acting director, human resources and compensation manager at UCSB, who allegedly told Signa “she would have someone follow up with him,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly went on stress leave on or around June 1, 2018. Shortly after, UCSB Employee &amp; Labor Relations Specialist Jessica Graham allegedly contacted Signa and said she would update him on the status of the complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of November 2018, Signa had not heard back from either Señeriz or Graham, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 19, 2018, Signa submitted two whistleblower complaints to UCSB, but had not heard back as of November 2018 when he filed the lawsuit against the UC Police Department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that more UCPD officers also submitted whistleblower complaints similar to Signa’s.
