The gestational time limit changed from 49 days to 70 days, according to the report by the FDA that was published on March 29, 2016.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the new label, the drug can also be administered by a health care provider rather than a physician, which the old label required. Post-treatment includes an assessment of the patient 7-14 days after the drug is taken, rather than a formal examination conducted by a physician, according to an article published by the <a href=\"http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/sally-rafie-pharmd/2016/04/abortion-pill-label-change-what-pharmacists-need-to-know\">Pharmacy Times.</a></p>\n<p>The waiting period to take Misoprostol, the medication taken after Mireprex, changed from 72 hours to 24-48 hours. The dosage of Misoprostol was also changed from 2 tablets (400 mcg) to 4 tablets (800 mcg).</p>\n<p>“[People] argued that the FDA were missing instances [in their review of the drug] where patients might have died because they were not using one of the [proper] monitoring systems that monitor the safety of drugs,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel System is the monitoring system used by the FDA to determine the safety of medicine by analyzing health information made available by physicians online, according to the FDA website.</p>\n<p>After an investigation of the FDA’s approval of changes, the GAO found that the attacks by the critics against the proper use of the Sentinel System were invalid because the Sentinel System applies only to drugs distributed through pharmacies.</p>\n<p>“MifePrex is not distributed through pharmacies so information on it would not be available in the Sentinel System to allow it to track safety concerns,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>Mifeprex does have another mechanism to track its safety concerns, and Crosse confirmed that Mifeprex has a low rate of serious medical events that occurred as a result of women taking the drug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An original version of this article stated that SB 320 will allow all public universities to provide the abortion pill.

He explained that a student initially contacted him about the issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82240\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"420696172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82231\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82240\" data-attachment-id=\"82240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/ucen-ceiling-collapse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ucen ceiling collapse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82240\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The collapsed piece of the ceiling can be seen in the photo above. <em>Courtesy of Hieu Le</em></p></div>\n<p>“It hasn’t been updated in over 50 years; we’re using a design and technology that do not meet modern efficiency standards,” Le said.</p>\n<p>There is currently no heat or air conditioning in the UCen Lobby or the Hub and the emergency generator circuit capacity needs to be expanded to include all “life safety and operational equipment,” according to the documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately $22,500 of this budget would be used to replace toilet partitions, hand dryers and other various bathroom accessories in three of the UCen bathrooms that have not been updated since 1966. These bathrooms need new water supply lines and need to be re-tiled.</p>\n<p>New “low-flow” toilets, faucets and fixtures need to be placed in the bathrooms as well, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>A total of 21 exterior doors need to be replaced and fitted with new locks. The UCen also needs to replace four of its regular elevators and one freight elevator.</p>\n<p>The sprinkler system is functional, but needs to be replaced and it is recommended that exposed sprinkler heads be concealed to prevent vandalism, according to the documents. Some of the UCen’s fire alarm control panels need to be upgraded to a campus standard networked system.</p>\n<p>“Those are the most essentially priority needs. We’ve accounted for that in the total priority costs,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Money raised by the UCen renovation project would be used to address these repairs, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“If this renovation expansion were to not happen, that operation and maintenance fee over a span of 30 years is going to accumulate to $40 to $45 million that’s spent into a current facility right now that is deteriorating and has declining value,” he said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students are paying approximately $40 a quarter in student fees to the UCen. If students <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-18/ucen-project-will-be-on-a-s-elections-ballot/\">vote</a> to pass the UCen renovation project at the end of April, student fees will increase by $20.40 until 2022, and to $96.06 until 2052.</p>\n<p>These numbers will rise due to inflation, according to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Design fees, internal feels, insurance, escalation and contingency fees are not included in the budget estimate.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a Thursday morning picture of a sewer leak in a water closet. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Food Bank, a campus pub and infrastructure upgrades for the UCen.</p>\n<p>“When we think of facilities such as the [Student Resource Building], or the [Recreation Center], facilities financed primarily by student investment dollars, it was students 10, 20, 30 years ago who decided to make this happen for us today, for us to have access to those resources,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project needs 50 percent + 1 “yes” votes for it to be implemented.</p>\n<p>If students vote in favor of the project, a $21.42 quarterly fee will be added to student fees until Fall 2022. Between fall 2022 and fall 2052, an additional $99.61 a quarter will be added to the fees, though that cost will progressively increase each year to match inflation.</p>\n<p>If passed, construction on the project will be completed by fall 2022. Additional fees will continue until 2052, according to the petition.</p>\n<p>Officials initially stated that the renovation would cost $48 million, but students would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">pay more</a> to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“I think this is something that each student will have to weigh themselves and see whether or not this is needed for our campus,” Le said. “But I myself am very supportive, and I’m supportive of the right for student autonomy to decide for themselves whether this should proceed or not.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Lu spent much of his time volunteering, including through beach clean-ups and music lessons in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An avid musician, Lu played the french horn in the Woodbridge High School marching band in Irvine, California. Lu also liked to play piano, baseball and work out with friends, often motivating them to exercise harder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Sanjongio became friends with Lu when the two played the french horn in their middle and high school band. Friends would often call Lu the “ride guy” because he was always willing to give someone a ride in his car if they needed to go somewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjongio described Lu as “iconic” and well-liked, reflecting on when Lu was crowned king of the Winter Formal and the multiple times Lu would fall asleep in class in high school.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says that Lu’s death has brought many of their high school friends together in a way only Lu could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it’s really horrible, it’s still like this new sense of connection and strength among all the people that he touched in his life, which is really amazing,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends from high school, including Sanjongio, also attended UCSB. Nathan Ng, a high school and college friend, echoed Sanjongio’s sentiments about Lu, adding that Lu approached everyone with a kindness and humility that is hard to find.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He went out of his way to help people, whether it was people in his normal social group or just people in general. He was very open to seeing how everyone was doing and I greatly respect that,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a present and constant part of his friends’ lives, said Eric Kim, a longtime friend of Lu’s and one of his roommates in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve known him for a long time, [and] I always expect his presence,” Kim said. “I’ve gotten used to him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was also enjoying his time at UCSB, Kim said, adding that Lu was excited to attend the university last summer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It exceeded expectations when he got here, he was really having a good time, even when he had a lot of work or classes,” Kim said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm Tsay met Lu in middle school and said Lu was “like a brother” to him.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was just the most helpful person ever,” Tsay said. “He always put other people first. You could talk to him about anything [and] he opened up his heart to everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsay set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/7u33cn-james-lus-funeral-fund\">GoFundMe</a> for Lu’s funeral and has raised over $13,000 so far. He said he wanted to give something back to Lu and help out his family.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a leader, Tsay said, and someone he could look to for guidance, whether it be for music or life advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I’m drum major of the marching band, and I wouldn’t have those leadership skills without the interactions I’ve shared with James and the advice he’s given me throughout the years,” Tsay said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another band friend, Aziz Hamza, said he continued to stay in contact with Lu at UCSB to see how he was adjusting to college life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamza described Lu as dedicated and having a “relaxed presence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d always be laughing, like, whatever conversation he would be having, it would be something humorous,” Hamza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends noted that Lu was on his way to teach piano to children on the day he died. They said it was a testament to Lu’s selflessness and generosity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just sums up his intentions in life. He wanted to help people he wanted to make a difference in the world,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Till the very end, he was helping others and using his ability and helping teach other people,” Kim added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng said he wants Lu to be remembered as someone who always encouraged others to try their best and put their needs before his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He opened my eyes to being optimistic in this world and doing your best,” Ng said. “Going through this grief of losing him, I’m getting stronger everyday, and I always feel like he’s still watching me. He’s the kind of person you should want to model yourself after.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu’s funeral will be held at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona Del Mar on Sunday, March 18, at 2 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Championships for the first time in the team’s history. <em>Courtesy of Alexandria Suebert</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Mock Trial team has qualified for the American Mock Trial Association National Championships for the first time in the team’s 20-year history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team placed second behind Stanford University in the Los Angeles division of the Opening Round Championship Series (O.R.C.S.), which determined their eligibility for Nationals, which will take place from April 20 to 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 48 of the 714 teams that participated in O.R.C.S. earned bids to attend Nationals, according to Vice President Marlon Steven Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the biggest accomplishment any team could achieve because of the high caliber of the Southern California area,” UCSB Mock Trial President and A team Captain Alexandria Suebert said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We compete against teams who have consistently placed highly at nationals and are highly concentrated within our area therefore to get a spot and be the second ranked team behind Stanford is phenomenal,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A team, which consists of Suebert, Co-Captain Blake Berich, Sudeep Dhanoa, Taylar Hender, Justine Jung, Jimmy McFeely, Marlon Steven Poroj, Kane Tenorio and Deborah Williams, is one of 48 teams that will travel to Minneapolis to compete in the National Championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s B team did not receive a bid for Nationals. However, they have surpassed their previous records, as this is the first year that both teams have qualified for O.R.C.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we were able to qualify and be put on the same playing field as our A team and qualify alongside schools that don’t take us seriously really means a lot to me, coming in as an underdog,” B Captain and Secretary Zenia Safadi said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is student-run and receives part-time assistance from a UCSB alum who acts as an attorney coach, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That fact has been disadvantageous due to the huge time commitments, no attorney coaches, high tournament fees, and travel expenses,” Poroj said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this is the team’s biggest accomplishment to date, they have been steadily increasing their status as a nationally known team. In 2014, the team took first place in the Yale University Invitational, and this past January they hosted Mocktopia, the second-largest tournament on the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert praised her teammates for their motivation and persistence, a combination of which gives them “the Umph,” as the Executive Board calls it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though they are not sure of what to expect from their first-ever tournament, during which they will compete against teams from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other Ivy League schools, Poroj believes that this is a defining moment in the team’s transformation as a team in it for fun, but also one that will “kick ass and take names.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we have never made it to Nationals before, we do not know what to expect, but we do know that only the best of the best will be competing … so we are going to Minneapolis with guns blazing,” Treasurer Janice Espindola said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ucsb-mock-trial-nationals\">GoFundMe</a> to help pay for the trip to Nationals. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the team did not have a coach.

id=\"caption-attachment-82091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Coalition for a Better UC presented to A.S. their campaign to extend Cal Grant aid to summer sessions, claiming it is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school. <em>Will Tran /Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition for a Better UC launched a campaign in the fall of 2017 focused on passing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3153</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will extend financial aid from Cal Grant into summer sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign is expected to end in June of 2018 when the State Assembly will vote on the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition is requesting that the funding for this aid increase come from Governor Jerry Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s fund, which will amount to  $13.5 billion by the summer of 2019 avoids raising taxes for the extended aid, according to Eddy Chikukwa the president and founder of the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California’s Office of the President (UCOP) estimated the total cost of summer tuition for all the UCs, Cal States and community colleges would be $148 million a year, which is 1 percent of Brown’s Rainy Day Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, said he was inspired to start this campaign when he began working for the UC Santa Barbara Office of Financial Aid earlier last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Directors for the Cal State campuses are meeting in April to discuss and potentially approve the Bill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The board] saying they’ll legitimize it, means 23 Cal States and the 450,000 students they represent said they’re [in support of] this. It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/","id":2308,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2307,2306,2305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stalker Reportedly Harassing Women After UCSB Lectures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=600%2C429&ssl=1","description":"The suspect has allegedly stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police are looking for a male UC Santa Barbara student who they say has stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspect has asked women for their phone numbers after classes, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) announced in a university alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the suspect feels ignored, he proceeds to harass the women, following them on social media, sending derogatory text and social media messages, and, in some cases, showing up at their residence,” the alert read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD is investigating the crime.

organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The student-run radio station struggled to match previous fund drives which raised $35,000 in 2017 and $29,000 the year before.</p>\n<p>Miles Bishop, KCSB general manager, explained that last year’s Thomas Fire impacted the station’s ability to advertise for the event and win over donors.</p>\n<p>“[The fires] really put us out of commission for the whole of December,” he explained.</p>\n<p>In previous years, the fund drive’s planning started in November and had about three-and-a-half months for setting up and advertising. This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div

sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” Le said. <em>Photo submitted anonymously</em></p></div>\n<p>“The petition misled since it was stating that it was mainly meant for the expansion of the Food Bank without clearly stating of the expansion of the UCen by increasing student fees,” advisor Rodolfo Ortiz said at the Food Bank Committee’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“The petition was put next to the sign-in sheet which caused students to mistake between the forms,” Vice Chair Tabitha Yuen said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The minutes reference the petition as having been “set-up by Hieu Le at the Food Bank lounge last week.”</p>\n<p>Le, however, did not respond when asked if he had set up the petition in the food bank himself.</p>\n<p>Le acknowledged that the petition had been placed “next to the sign-in sheet for the actual food bank.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” he said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to “disapprove” the UCen expansion petition in the food bank during the March 2 meeting, meaning they will no longer allow the petition to be placed within the bank, according to first-year history major James Ferraro.</p>\n<p>“The ballot language is long and extensive … What I would argue is that people aren’t going to look through it in depth, people are going to vote for things and not see it, and so people are going to pass a fee raise,” Ferraro said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of student fees, the university itself and an alumni donation fund, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’ve raised about $2.5 million on campus equities, not donors yet,” Le said. “There is an anticipation that we’re gonna raise quite a good amount, but we don’t have a certain figure in mind yet.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse and Dumlao both said Le and his fellow students have not been open regarding fees when approaching students about the petition.</p>\n<p>“Not only have I witnessed [this], but constituents have told me that they’re not being told the fact that their student fees are going to be increased,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>“The issue is, even if we get donors and we assume that they’re going to give us $10 million, there’s still a budget that needs to be covered that would be from the student expense,” she added.</p>\n<p>Dumlao explained the project is being publicized as expanding the food bank and improving the UCen rather than focusing on the fact that student fees will rise.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard from multiple people, both people who have been asked to sign the petition and … people who Hieu has been soliciting to work with him, that they have been told not to say or explicitly mention right off the bat that student fees will be raised if you sign that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le denied not fully explaining the petition to students.</p>\n<p>“The cost is reflected in the petition, and our process is to hold the highest standards of integrity,” Le said. “Students at this university are very smart, and they know what they’re signing and they know what the idea is. Our job is to educate them on the process.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, the UCen is now more than 50 years old, was designed to accommodate 17,000 students and was last updated in 1994. Currently, UCSB has more than 25,000 students and 6,800 faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>It is projected that 28,000 students will be enrolled by 2025, the petition says.</p>\n<p>“These facilities can no longer support the needs of our growing community, nor are they designed to keep up with the ever-changing and increasing technological demands of the current generation,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>The project was first proposed six years ago, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“All three sponsors, A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center worked and consulted with students, clubs and organizations,” Le said. “The Office of Budget &amp; Planning was the one who drafted the [current] proposal.”</p>\n<p>If the petition is placed on the ballot and students vote in favor of it, student fees will increase $21.42 per quarter during Fall Quarter 2018. The increase will remain an additional $21.42 per quarter until Fall Quarter 2022, at which point it will increase to a “maximum” of $99.61 per quarter, including summer, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’re addressing an overcrowded campus; students are competing against each other for spots, spots inside the classroom; people are sitting in the aisles; students are waiting two weeks to see a psychological or academic counselor,” Le said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what we’re looking at is that students are competing against each other for spots, rather than we’re not addressing the issue in terms of providing access, and fair access, to each and every single one of our campus community [members],” he added.</p>\n<p>The petition needs 3,116 signatures to be placed on the ballot for students to vote on during Spring Quarter, according to Le. The deadline to get these signatures is March 16 and as of Wednesday night, the petition has approximately 2,000 signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Gessesse said “constituents,” not “kids.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Even with outside donations, the amount students would pay in fees still far exceeds the $48 million total that officials have mentioned.</p>\n<p>If the bill were passed, only part of the student fees would go toward renovating and maintaining the UCen. A much larger portion would go toward paying off loans that the university would take out to finish the job in just four years. The university would need 30 more years to pay off those loans, plus interest.</p>\n<p>The fees would also include administrative costs, which would go to A.S., UCSB administration and financial aid distribution.</p>\n<p>The “NewCen” project, which Le first introduced in late January, would bring the UCen a 24-hour study space, a project laboratory, expanded office space for campus organizations and a central pub.</p>\n<p>Le contends that the time is ripe to “revitalize” the facilities because the UCen was last renovated back in 1994, when UCSB held 8,000 fewer students.</p>\n<p>“The revitalized complex is envisioned as the heart of campus by the UCSB lagoon where students can congregate, eat, socialize, study, work, debate and collaborate,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>If Le can secure 3,116 valid signatures by March 16 and the UC Office of the President gives approval, the NewCen will be placed on the Associated Students elections ballot this April. Then, students could vote to pass the fee by a threshold of 50 percent plus one voter. The fee would take effect in the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p>If passed, the renovation would require a $21.42 quarterly student fee until 2022, after which students would pay a $99.61 quarterly fee through 2052.</p>\n<p>The earlier, $21.42 fee is for students who would never see the results of a UCen renovation. Over the following 30 years, UCSB students would continue paying for the renovated building, which would be finished by 2022.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Le said that it is still “entirely uncertain” if student fees will be needed to pay for the project at all. He mentioned that he may have a “unique opportunity” to work with “big donors” who could offset the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>First-year history major James Ferraro, who has followed the project’s early development, also estimated a $190 million cost for the project when he spoke at the Senate public forum.</p>\n<p>While the UCSB Office of Development could contribute to the funding, there is a cap to the amount the office could give, Ferraro told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>In the “best-case scenario,” the office would put $35 million toward funding the renovation, Ferraro said, citing Le’s own estimation at a recent organization meeting. Realistically, the office may contribute between $15 and $35 million.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print

students walked out of class on Monday afternoon in support of undocumented students, urging for immigration reform within the United States and for better resources for undocumented individuals at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The protest, organized by UCSB’s Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (I.D.E.A.S.), began at Storke Tower. Students and faculty members then marched through the Arbor walkway to Cheadle Hall, where they briefly walked inside before gathering outside of the building.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day [DREAMERS] are in a prison.

to bypass the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second level of the federal court process, by having the Supreme Court review an order made in January.</p>\n<p>The January court order by Federal Judge William Alsup, which temporarily blocked Trump’s attempt to end DACA, also involved the UC’s lawsuit against the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in September, claiming the repeal of DACA violated the rights of people who benefit from the program.</p>\n<p>The UC announced in a statement on Monday that they are pleased the Supreme Court has denied the government’s appeal.</p>\n<p>“Now that the administration’s extraordinary maneuver has been rightfully rejected, we look forward to defending U.S. District Judge Alsup’s injunction in the Court of Appeals,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez in Calif. ruled on Monday that Trump cannot rescind DACA protection without giving its recipients notice in order to legally defend themselves. This allows the Obama-era program more time to protect young undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez’s preliminary injunction states that the administration cannot take away recipients’ individual protection under DACA.</p>\n<p>After declining Trump’s request, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to accept DACA renewal applications for existing recipients, while the DACA court case will continue through the regular federal court processes.</p>\n<p>Trump announced in September that he would end DACA by March 5. With less than a week to go until that date, Monday’s ruling is seen as a win for the nearly 700,000 young immigrants that are protected from deportation under DACA.</p>\n<p>March 5 was seen as a deadline for Congress to take bipartisan action on immigration reform, which resulted in a three-day government shutdown last month. That deadline is now void, since the ruling gives Congress more time to make a decision on a long-term bill.</p>\n<p>The court process is expected to take months, which may allow Congress time to pass a long-term spending bill for DACA and immigration reform. However, it may also delay action due to a lack of urgency, since the federal court process will likely pick up in October during the Supreme Court’s new term.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling is the third time a lower court has ruled against Trump’s rescindment of DACA, which essentially deems his efforts illegal and allows the program to continue past March 5.</p>\n<p>The first was in January, an action Trump attempted to appeal on Monday.

By providing a safe space and a location to receive assistance, A.S. reinforces Dreamers’ inclusion in the UCSB community. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The resolution was authored by A.S. Senators Steven Ho and Brandon Mora and sponsored by fourth-year psychology major Lezli B. and fourth-year economics and accounting major Karla L.</p>\n<p>The list of demands include hiring a full-time immigration attorney and an additional undocumented students program coordinator, providing additional financial aid options and internship opportunities for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. previously presented their demands to UCSB Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn, but there has been “little action [taken],” Lezli said.</p>\n<p>They will be meeting with the administration on Friday to further discuss these demands.</p>\n<p>“We just want administration to know that it’s not just [I.D.E.A.S.] behind this. We hope that the administration sees this and sees the importance of [the resolution] because we’ve been trying to get these demands passed for a while,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>The list also includes a proposed expansion of the current center for undocumented students on campus, the Monarch Lounge, which opened in April 2017.</p>\n<p>Plans for the expansion of the Monarch Lounge include adding an additional study space, a conference room, an office for the Undocumented Student Services (USS) Coordinator, an office for the immigration attorney, a front desk, kitchen, gender-neutral bathrooms and a workspace for an USS intern.</p>\n<p>These demands are expected to “[improve] the quality of life for undocumented students on campus,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, “undocumented students account for at least 800 undergraduate students” and over 800,000 Dreamers are currently affected by the repeal of DACA, putting these students in “vulnerable” positions.</p>\n<p>The resolution also addressed UCSB and Isla Vista’s history of I.C.E. raids and the overall fear undocumented students may experience on campus.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for undocumented students are limited because most jobs and internships require a social security number, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Financial aid is also limited and often doesn’t meet the needs of undocumented students, according to the resolution. The status of these students also impacts their ability to secure housing and sources of income.</p>\n<p>“We’re glad this is a step forward to know that there are leaders of our student body supporting us,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>Legal support for undocumented students on campus is available through University of California Immigrant Legal Services Center, which operates out of the UC Davis School of Law.</p>\n<p>Attorneys from the center visit UC campuses two to three times a quarter, according to the law school’s website.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the only attorney UCSB students have access to is currently located at UC San Diego and is “constantly overbooked.”</p>\n<p>“Many of us will not be able to pursue a life in the U.S. We should equally benefit and experience that UCSB aims to provide for every student,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/","id":2329,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2328,2327,2326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Is It Cool to Juul?

According to the California College and <a href=\"http://cyanonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CA-College-SmokeTobacco-Free-Report-Card-2016.pdf\">University Smoke/Tobacco-Free Policy Report Card</a>, secondhand “e-cigarette aerosol is a new source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ultrafine/fine particles.”</p>\n<p>Studies from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the UC Office of the President reveal that around 16 percent of the college-age population and 8 percent of University of California students vape or handle similar nicotine products. The Report Card also says that in Calif., young adults are three times as likely to use e-cigarettes than adults over 30.</p>\n<p>Devices like JUUL, PHIX and similar models are among the most common e-cig products in use among students.</p>\n<p>According to the Report Card, UC Santa Barbara is 100 percent smoke and tobacco free, including e-cigarettes. Despite this, UCSB has not escaped this new fad, and these devices “are a rising concern for UCSB,” according to UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program.</p>\n<p>The CDC and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department warn that these products can hurt the respiratory system “just like traditional cigarette smoke can,” and the addictive properties of the chemical make it just as harmful for psychological health.</p>\n<p>Madison Barnes, a tobacco cessation educator at UCSB, explained that the consequences of vaping are normally not taken into consideration by users.</p>\n<p>“Vaping and e-cigarettes are a rising concern for UCSB as many students believe they are a healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB actively works towards limiting use and providing various resources to get addicted students off these products.</p>\n<p>One of these resources is the Alcohol and Drug Program, which offers support services to students that include free addiction cessation products and psychological advising in order to help afflicted students.</p>\n<p>But even with the seeming decline of traditional smoking use and the ongoing efforts of UCSB’s administration to limit other forms of nicotine consumption, major challenges still remain to halt addiction across the student population.</p>\n<p>One student, who asked to remain anonymous due to housing regulations, explained that the dissipating smell of the vape and the strength of the nicotine makes it an ideal illegal substance in small areas like the dorms.</p>\n<p>However, because of the high nicotine concentration in the devices, vapes can make users extremely susceptible to addiction.</p>\n<p>Nik Babourine, first-year mathematics major, said he has met students in the Santa Catalina halls “that can’t even stay focused in group study sessions because they need to leave to get their Juul.”</p>\n<p>Michael Takahara from UCSB’s Smoke and Tobacco Free steering committee explained that efforts to keep students from consuming nicotine will counter efforts of companies that supply these products.</p>\n<p>“New ways of delivering nicotine to the body will continue to evolve as the Tobacco Industry works at creating new life long customers,” Takahara said in an email.</p>\n<p>As newer methods and trends of nicotine consumption rise, UCSB’s various support services and policymakers “will continue to learn about them and address them” for the foreseeable future, Takahara said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
