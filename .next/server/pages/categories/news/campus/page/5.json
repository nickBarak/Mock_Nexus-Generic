As a result, ID isn’t working to fully convert in-person classes into digital ones but to create “hybrid” classrooms by bolstering the teaching technology that’s already available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Yang first announced the switch to online coursework last Tuesday, ID has helped teaching staff incorporate programs such as </span><a href=\"https://collaborate.ucsb.edu/services/gauchospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Home.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panopto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/from-course-to-source-new-learning-platform-streamlines-communication-between-students-and-professors/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into their online lectures by holding ongoing workshops, which will be hosted through spring break, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the workshops, instructors can ask questions pertaining to the different software programs, such as how to take attendance, record and post lectures, distribute and grade assignments, hold digital office hours and even call on students when they digitally raise their hand, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a majority of the remote instruction tools aren’t new, according to Michaels. When the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> broke out in 2017, ID worked to equip instructors with tools to teach classes remotely in the event that in-person classes were canceled, which laid the groundwork for ID’s current efforts, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to successfully meet the need [for online instruction] at that point in time and have retained those resources,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three to four weeks ago, Michaels said ID began preparing workshops and started assessing how prepared the university’s digital teaching materials were so that “if things really go sideways,” ID was “ready to move as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Michaels said some professors have had issues with online assessments, such as GauchoSpace quizzes, which can crash when too many students are tested simultaneously. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels said ID is offering instructors one-on-one consultations to work around these problems by providing solutions, such as making a GauchoSpace quiz available over a 12 to 24 hour period “to spread the impact out as much as possible” and prevent these systems from crashing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students on social media have also posed questions about the fate of their waitlisted classes next quarter, as digital classrooms lack the constraint of physical seating. Michaels said waitlists will still exist, as class enrollment information is stored in the campus registrar — “which constitutes the class roster” — and is fed into GauchoSpace.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classroom attendance will follow similarly, Michaels said; a professor using Zoom or GauchoCast can use their class roster on GauchoSpace to take attendance based on who joins the digital class, just as they would have done in a physical classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea is to try to keep that roster information as up-to-date as humanly possible. The wait list, and to a certain extent, the attendance tool, in the absence of a face-to-face class can be a way to emulate [that] the student shows up on the first day at class and walks up to the faculty member afterwards to get an add code,” Michaels said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels highlighted ID’s efforts to provide the university with different teaching solutions under a tight turnaround but acknowledged that access to online courses is still an issue for students who have to go home and don’t have a laptop or internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus recognizes that that’s a big issue and there are lots of people working really hard to try to come up with a workaround solution for that,” Micahels said, adding that the Enterprise Technology Services, Student Affairs and the University Library are currently working on a solution to provide students with long-term loaner laptops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But “the missing part is if they don’t have a network at home,” Michaels said, so a loaner laptop won’t be of much use if a student is looking to join their class on Zoom or GauchoSpace without an internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, however, Michaels said that most instructors, specifically the ones who attended workshops, have adjusted well to the transition from in-person to digital classrooms. He said the biggest issue lies in how confident each instructor feels in their ability to teach an online class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have over a thousand faculty members … we’ve got some faculty members who’ve been teaching fully online courses, primarily through summer sessions, for almost 10 years now. For them, this is an adjustment, but it’s using tools that they’ve already become very comfortable with,” Michaels said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For other faculty members, some elements of the technology landscape or ecosystem that we have is all new territory for them,” he added. “Everybody is figuring out how they’re going to cope with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As other UC campuses roll out their own remote instruction programs, Michaels said ID shares its new technologies, information and resources through the </span><a href=\"https://cio.ucop.edu/meet-the-educational-technology-leadership-committee/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educational Technology Leadership Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (ETLC), a decade-old collaborative group that represents the ID office equivalent at each UC campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have regular monthly Zoom meetings. We have an annual face-to-face meeting. We’re constantly sharing information about things that are going on in our campuses,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As soon as campuses started ramping up [remote instruction efforts], one of the things that the ETLC did, besides communicating via email, is we started a Google doc with links to all of the resource sites that we were all developing or expanding,” he said, “so that all of us had the benefit of seeing what kinds of support we’re providing to our faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students prepare to go home for spring break, Michaels said ID’s chief concern is ensuring that instructors are prepared to teach classes remotely, while also continuing to improve the teaching resources that are already available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing that I really appreciated is that everybody recognizes that this is an unprecedented situation. The faculty members that have been coming to our workshops are uniformly thankful to have the help,” Michaels said. “They’ve been very supportive of us, which is awesome.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The program suspended seven study abroad programs in Europe earlier on March 12 and plans to officially suspend 30 more programs on March 16 as the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued warnings against international travel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 16, programs in the Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Ireland, England and Scotland had also been suspended. On March 17 and 18, UCEAP announced its program in Chile and its programs in Brazil and Japan were also suspended. </span></p>\n<p>On March 19, UCEAP said all summer study abroad programs had been suspended as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC policy mandates that study abroad programs be suspended if there are Level 3 Travel Advisories, or “Avoid Nonessential Travel” for a country. As of Thursday, nine countries in Europe have now been given a </span><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-europe#countries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level 3

wrote on its website that all summer 2020 study abroad programs would continue as scheduled except:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biodiversity, National University of Singapore, Singapore</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China summer 2020 programs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span

Thailand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel noted that the time difference made it difficult for her family, who often heard about news like Trump’s travel suspension while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go

So we’re going to keep eyes on it in terms of making sure our community is safe,” Armistead added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that despite the delays, the planning for the festival did serve to lay the foundation for a festival in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a silver lining here,” Brandt explained. “We’ve done, essentially, all the legwork that we needed to get to a point where the community festival will become a reality and where we will be able to transition folks into an alternative event that is fun, that is safe and changes the vibe of what’s going on during Deltopia weekend in a significant way for the better.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

the CDPH reports to the CDC, which then reports to the World Health Organization, Javanbakht said. The chain of command, however, is not a strict hierarchy, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student exhibits coronavirus symptoms, Javanbakht said the university would notify the SB County Public Health Department about the potential case, which will advise Student Health as to whether or not to test the individual based on “how suspicious” their case is or the likelihood that they may have coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a pretty suspicious [case], then the next step is, ‘Okay, who else could have been exposed?’ And if it’s a student, that [case] comes back to us,” Javanbakht said. “And if that student’s symptoms are in line with the guidelines, that’s someone that we need to test.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But students don’t always go straight to Student Health, Javanbakht said. It’s up to the SB County Public Health Department to notify Student Health if a student exhibits symptoms somewhere else, such as at a local emergency room or urgent care, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Student Health and the SB County Public Health Department reasonably suspect that a student may have coronavirus, the public health department will work to pin down who they’ve been in contact with in the past two weeks to “expand that circle,” according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would calculate the risk a potentially infected student posed to their classmates by sending someone to campus to survey the features of classroom spaces, including looking at the room’s dimensions and the space between tables or desks to determine which students may have been exposed if a student had coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Javanbakht said Student Health would work with the registrar’s office to find people who were potentially exposed to coronavirus and would let them know that “they might need to be tested.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student does test positive for coronavirus, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would contact individuals who were “close enough to be exposed” and instruct them to isolate themselves and “find their own room separate from everyone else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who had a low-risk exposure, Javanbakht said they could still go about their day but said that it was important to report symptoms as soon as possible, because “then we need to intervene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB runs out of space to house exposed students, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department will provide the university with additional space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, UCSB and Isla Vista are notorious for their often-cramped living situations, so “if people are in close quarters,” Javanbakht said, “that’s absolutely a factor.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This stuff tends to live on surfaces, and if you have a lot of people close [to each other] touching the common surfaces, yeah, the risk tends to be higher than someone who’s out on a farm by themselves,” he added, stressing the importance of keeping good hygiene.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the campus community informed about the coronavirus, Student Health has sent a number of emails to the student body in the past two months to quell concerns and provide updates on potential cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, Javanbakht said Student Health has reached out to campus entities that deal with a high volume of students, such as the Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises, the Department of Recreation and the University Library, to detail hygiene methods that can decrease the spread of coronavirus on campus, such as using hand sanitizer and reminding students to wash their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Feb. 13 emergency operations meeting, a number of campus representatives met to discuss a potential response to coronavirus cases on campus, with each representative giving feedback on what resources they could provide in case of an outbreak on campus, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht also noted that all five UC medical centers and all 10 UC campuses participate in a twice-a-week phone call with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to share information about positive and potential coronavirus cases.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is also in contact with the UCOP medical director, who works with the medical directors at each UC campus to inform them about ongoing cases at universities outside the UC and their efforts to treat and contain them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said Student Health is in the midst of preparing a message for the student body about coronavirus and traveling for spring break, as many students are a couple weeks away from packing their bags and leaving Santa Barbara to go home or on vacation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said the message will warn students about traveling to countries impacted by coronavirus and the possibility of being quarantined in another country or being isolated when returning to campus, he said. It will also include a reminder to report any possible symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So between now and the end of spring break, as developments come up, if something changes, if there’s a new area of activity that we need to be concerned about, then we send messages again,” Javanbakht added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As coronavirus spreads, so does fear, which Javanbakht stressed as the “biggest threat to our campus.” Social media and rumors can instill fears that aren’t real or rational, and news headlines can trigger “fear mongering” if written poorly, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If all you’re looking at is coronavirus updates, over time, it can give a really distorted view and some people can take on what’s called a catastrophic view — that this is a catastrophe,” he said. “Realistically speaking, right now, the risk to 24,000 students on this campus [is] still relatively low.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Again, things might change but overall, right now, go about your day [and] practice good hand hygiene,” Javanbakht said. “We’re doing everything we can.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

infected. </span><em>Melody Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the China study abroad program was cancelled at the end of January, the South Korea and Italy programs were cancelled last week as more cases of the virus were confirmed across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, these are the only three programs that have been suspended because they are the only three countries for which the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued at least a Level 3 Travel Advisory, which means “Avoid Nonessential Travel.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime that the CDC and the Department of State have a Travel Advisory Alert at a Level 3, we are required by UC policy to suspend programs,” said Myla Edmond, University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, 350 students across the UC system have been affected by these three program suspensions, Edmond said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the programs were officially suspended, Edmond said UCEAP “strongly encouraged” students to return home, although they can’t require students to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Edmond said it was dependent on a student’s home UC campus whether the student could enroll in spring quarter courses once they returned, which would also vary depending on when the programs were suspended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frances Woo, a third-year sociology major at UC Santa Barbara, was studying abroad in Florence, Italy during winter quarter when her program was suspended. At first, there were three confirmed cases in Italy around Feb. 24, Woo said. But in the next four days, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to around 400, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With all of this happening, a lot of the students, all the people I talked to about it, they were just kind of talking about it amongst ourselves because the school didn’t really say anything about it,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Woo said she wasn’t as concerned about the virus itself, particularly because it is more dangerous for the elderly and people with illnesses, she said she was worried that she would have to be quarantined once she returned, which could affect her spring quarter enrollment at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was just afraid that, knowing [President Donald Trump], that he was gonna implement a travel ban and do something drastic that could leave us like stranded [in Italy],” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we came back at the same day that we’re supposed to, if we got quarantined for two weeks, that would mean that’d we’d miss the first week of classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the program’s suspension, Woo said she was frequently checking news sites and getting traveler alerts about the increasing risk in Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the university did send emails to students to let them know it was monitoring the situation, Woo and several other students emailed UCEAP coordinators criticizing the minimal communication from UCEAP, particularly as the situation in Italy began to develop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though [UCEAP] said they were monitoring the situation, they didn’t really give updates, they just kind of gave us a link a couple days ago and told us to check on it ourselves,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students that I was talking to knew a lot more about the situation than the school itself, or at least what the school was telling us, which was really frustrating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a day before the Italy program was officially suspended, Woo said students received an email saying that they could choose to withdraw from the program early. But Woo noted that, for many students, buying a last-minute plane ticket isn’t financially feasible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a quote unquote optional thing, it’s not really optional for those students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the program was officially suspended on Feb. 28, UCEAP told students they could submit claims to be reimbursed for their tickets for up to $2,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woo and other students in the Florence program only received four units per course as opposed to five due to the program suspension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no programs beyond Italy, South Korea and China have been suspended so far, Edmond said UCEAP was “monitoring the entire world at this point.” As of Wednesday evening, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that at least 95,400 people across the globe had the virus, and that people in at least 80 countries had been infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are preparing to go abroad are being told to continue as if their programs will be held, according to Edmond.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Khamenian, a third-year communication major, is scheduled to study abroad in Japan for spring quarter through UCEAP, but Japan is currently at a Level Two alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In three weeks, I have a plane ticket to go abroad for spring quarter in Japan, and everything’s set, my plan has been to go third-year, spring quarter, but obviously the coronavirus and everything has kind of put me in a limbo,” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s prepped for me to go abroad, but I don’t actually know if I’m going abroad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan, elementary through high schools were recently shut down, but there haven’t been any cancellations for universities so far, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCEAP is telling me, ‘We’ll let you know if CDC says it’s Level 3’ … in that case we don’t go, but that could be when I’m in Japan in three weeks, and it can be the second day there, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, actually go back,’” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the possibility of her study abroad program being cancelled, Khamenian would have to deal with finding housing and registering for classes, which she doesn’t think would be a possibility so last minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if I should pack for going abroad or for going home for break only,” Khamenian added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so many things up in the air.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V. Co-op and the UCSB Sustainability to ensure everything is running smoothly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also check in and receive feedback from other leaders on campus like the Middle Eastern Resource Center, and the Muslim Student Association for new ideas and to see how we can improve or better serve our joint Muslim and Jewish Community,” Shahaf added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Shahaf, the importance of the program extends beyond its day-to-day operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Keeping Kosher is how I keep my ancestors and my cultural past close to my heart, and it is one of the only aspects of Judaism in my daily life,” she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I imagine it is similar for many Muslim students who keep Halal, as they are reminded of Islamic persecution around the world. I want to make it possible for every Jewish and Muslim student to keep their religious dietary restrictions, and to feel seen and supported by this campus.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/","id":1867,"author":{"id":276,"name":"Daniel Seo"},"related":[1866,1865,1864],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University, Organizations Discuss Voter Registration Efforts as California Primary Approaches","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In I.V., registration numbers have peaked at 13,000 registered voters during presidential election years.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara boasts one of the highest rates of student voter registration in the country — at 40.2% in 2018.

As of the 2010 census, more than 23,000 people live in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deadline has passed to register for the March primary, the work is hardly over for Marsano, with the November 2020 election right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I anticipate that this upcoming presidential election will be busy. Of course, we will only have three and a half weeks to register students because they come back the last week of September and the deadline to register next year is October 19 and elections are November 3,” Marsano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed UCSB’s high voter registration percentage to a greater push for in-person registration, opposed to online registration as most other universities do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s notorious about preferring face-to-face voter registration rather than online,” Marsano explained. “You would get a card and if you didn’t do something with that card and mail it back, you would not be really registered. So the follow-up was more complicated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is another important factor in the voting process that many of the organizations take on in addition to registration, according to Christian Ornelas, the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ornelas noted that the EVPLA office attempted to clear misinformation about voting after Rock the Vote SB’s national organization declared the local chapter illegitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After their first big efforts for registry during welcome week at campus dorms, Natalie Bastawros, vice president of Campus Democrats, said the VRVC went to great lengths to make sure everyone had the opportunity to register to vote in Santa Barbara County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The goal of the club is to try to make it easier for people to register,” Bastawros said about the VRVC. She explained that if an individual registers online within Santa Barbara County, and they miss a box or two, the county sends you back an additional form in the mail for you to fill out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Democrats table Monday through Friday all of winter quarter for voter registration, according to Bastawros, and have also increased door-to-door canvassing in I.V. and at university housing. An app called PDI allows Campus Democrats to access public voter registration information, allows canvassers to target locations with low registration, according to Bastawros.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations pushing for voter registration often face resistance from students who are already registered, but in a different county. A big part of tabling is educating students how local policies can have significant impact,” Bastawros said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not seem like that on the national level, but for the local elections here as students live, whether you live on campus or in I.V., it’s really, really important to register here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Feb. 18 voter registration deadline, Campus Democrats tabled at ten different locations on campus up until the 6 p.m. deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. is a “swing district” that determines the 3rd District County Supervisor vote, Bastawros said. While the other districts are fairly unwavering, the 3rd District, which encompasses I.V. and parts of northern and central Santa Barbara County, is often the deciding vote between the more rural 4th and 5th districts and the smaller but more populated 1st and 2nd districts that include Santa Barbara and Carpinteria.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Crommelin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 20, Lafayette, a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, came to UC Santa Barbara to talk to the student body about how to live as conscious citizens in a world shaped by the actions of social activists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion, titled “An Evening with Dr. Bernard Lafayette Jr.: Nonviolence in a Time of Civil Unrest,” was organized by the Associated Students Program Board and marked Lafayette’s first visit to the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most associated with the Freedom Riders and later the Selma Voting Rights movement, Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash and James Bevel in the American Civil Rights Movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1967, King even offered Lafayette a position as the program director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus before the lecture, Lafayette went into detail regarding his experiences as a political organizer and a protester, working with the Nashville Student Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the SCLC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also lamented traits that he said he has seen in some present-day social movements and activists, such as a tendency to focus on the problems themselves rather than proposed solutions, as well as an inability to look at their activism from a broader perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Present-day activists] need to reexamine to see whether or not they’re taking everything into consideration. And whether or not they’re benefiting also from the laws enacted, changed and whether or not they are harmful to themselves or harmful to others as well,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Public policy is very much related to what people expect and expectations from constituencies that are involved … they can’t look at it from a narrow, narrow view. Unfortunately, people sometimes make decisions [solely] based on their own ethnic identity or political affiliation,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the arrival of advanced technology, such as the internet, has allowed people who share similar values and ways of thinking to establish forums and foster vibrant communities of activists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, for instance, changed the playing field in regards to how opinions, personal musings and even breaking news is communicated to and amongst the masses, Lafayette said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[With social media] you can communicate with large numbers of people,” he said. “We didn’t have that. We had to use little simple methods and depend so much on the public media.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with the media, however, still remains an incredibly important thing to do, Lafayette said. He added that the media is the party that will project a social movement to the broader public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we were able to accomplish the things that we accomplished, because we learned how to deal with the media. Part of the whole movement is to reach the masses of people … you need to pay special attention to maintain and sustain a movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media is [still] important … you have to learn how to maintain communication with the media in such a way that your movement is able to continue,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lafayette recalled his experience as one of the original Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who protested segregated buses in the South by riding interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in mixed-race groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Freedom Riders were arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette said he and his companions were able to create more publicity for their movement when they were taken into police custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than [make bail] and continue on to New Orleans, we decided to stay in jail a longer period of time. We stayed in jail to prolong the movement,” Lafayette said, adding that “as a result of this, we had [people from] about 11 different countries come to the U.S.” to express solidarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he began his talk, Lafayette started to discuss lineage, speaking to the crowd about his formative years growing up in the Tampa, Florida area, as well as his Afro-Caribbean and French roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the talk, Lafayette focused on the distinction between successful and unsuccessful social movements, asking, “What are some of the techniques and strategies that are actually applicable universally?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest answer to this, according to Lafayette, is also the simplest: disciplined nonviolence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He attributed the significance of civil disobedience to its ability to invalidate unjust laws without resorting to acts of violence. In particular, Lafayette emphasized the importance of accepting the legal consequences of civil disobedience in order to lend weight to one’s argument.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What you don’t want to do is behave the same way the others behave. If you’re gonna bring about change, you have to change yourself first,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You must only accept the consequences. That was the most important lesson I learned,” Lafayette said. “You have to be willing to accept the consequences when you refuse to obey an unjust law because the law is [supposed] to determine your behavior, but you make it ineffective when you ignore it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette also described the need to appeal to the popular majority in order to secure civil rights gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was Napoleon who said that no revolution has ever been won without the active support of the majority. Who do you think passed the Civil Rights Bill in Congress?” he asked the crowd. “There weren’t no Black elected officials to pass no bill. We were able to win them over.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the floor opened to questions, the audience honed in specifically on Lafayette’s relationship with the late King.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his disagreements with King, Lafayette could only recall one — whether or not the Albany Movement to desegregate public spaces in Georgia was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“King believed that we failed, but my position was that no, we succeeded in the Albany Movement. Martin Luther King would always get involved in movements that had larger impact and bring about some national change or national legislation,” Lafayette said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might have resolved that if he lived.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how he responded to the news of King’s death, Lafayette described how the tragedy reinstilled in him the drive to continue King’s work. Lafayette said he devoted his energy and attention to King’s broader long-term goal: to spread the practice of nonviolence across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to make a decision, with the news of his death … I decided to focus on the last words that King said to me: ‘We have got to internationalize and institutionalize nonviolence.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After King’s death, Lafayette returned to school to further educate himself on the law and the utility of nonviolence in social and political advocacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went to law school at Boston University because I wanted to think like a lawyer. I didn’t want to be a lawyer, but I wanted to think like a lawyer. Then I went to Harvard University to study nonviolence and education, and I got my master’s.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After college, he would continue to work as an activist for decades, becoming a distinguished authority on nonviolent strategies for social activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with nonviolence, Lafayette said persistence is also a key ingredient in the making of a successful social movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, I was beaten in Selma, Alabama, the same night that Medgar Evers who was in the NAACP, in Mississippi, was shot and killed. And they planned to do the same thing to me the same night,” Lafayette said. “Fortunately, I survived that.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The FBI reported to me that [the Ku Klux Klan] had a plan to castrate me, to throw me in the river, and all that, you know. But fortunately I survived it,” he added. “ Don’t give up on the campaign, no matter what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
