id=\"caption-attachment-70795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Doe’s suspension was reversed earlier this month. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The case, <em>John Doe</em> v. <em>University of California Regents</em>, focuses on two students referred to as Jane Roe and John Doe in court documents.</p>\n<p>Doe was officially suspended from UCSB in 2016 after Roe accused him of sexually assaulting her on June 26, 2015.</p>\n<p>UCSB placed Doe on interim suspension beginning Sept. 16, 2015, while the school investigated Roe’s claim. He was officially suspended for eight quarters following a hearing from the Sexual/Interpersonal Violence Conduct Committee.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the SB Superior Court court found that Doe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was denied access to critical evidence – a copy of a report that described Roe’s alleged injuries following the assault – during the hearing;</li>\n<li>was denied the opportunity to “adequately cross-examine witnesses,” including Roe herself and Doe’s mother, among others;</li>\n<li>and was denied the opportunity to present evidence, such as information regarding Roe’s antidepressant medication, in his defense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It is ironic that an institution of higher learning, where American history and government are taught, should stray so far from the principles that underlie our democracy,” court documents read.</p>\n<p>Doe will be rewarded some form of compensation, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">second reversal</a> of a UCSB Title IX case the <em>Nexus</em> has reported on in recent months.</p>\n<p><strong>JANE ROE</strong></p>\n<p>Roe said Doe sexually assaulted her that night at Doe’s girlfriend’s apartment. Doe’s girlfriend is referred to in court documents as Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p>Roe had consumed wine, beer and mango margaritas that night and said she had felt “pretty drunk” and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in the apartment’s living room.</p>\n<p>She stated she woke at an unknown time, “completely disoriented,” to an “intense, throbbing pain.”</p>\n<p>Roe said she pretended to be asleep because she did not want a confrontation while her assaulter allegedly “unhooked [her] bra”; “suck[ed] and bit” her for several minutes; “[took] photos of her naked breasts” and repeatedly “penetrated [her] vagina and anus” with his fingers and/or penis.</p>\n<p>She said she realized it was Doe when her assaulter stopped and got up from the bed, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Roe was medically examined by the Santa Barbara County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) two days after the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>The SART report said there was “bruising and laceration noted in the anal area,” according to University of California Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso.</p>\n<p>However, neither Roe nor the detective provided a full copy of the SART report with this information attached during the trial.</p>\n<p>“The SART report was critical evidence,” court documents state. “At a minimum UCSB should have required the detective to provide a complete copy of the SART report.”</p>\n<p>Roe’s story that night also conflicted with Eyewitness One’s report.</p>\n<p>Following the alleged assault, Roe said Eyewitness One approached the bed and screamed when she saw that Roe’s “bottom half” was completely bare.</p>\n<p>Eyewitness One testified over Skype that Roe was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and underwear when she got up from the bed, contradicting Roe’s claim. She also denied screaming.</p>\n<p>The mattress was also absent of “any visible signs or smells of bodily fluids” consistent with anal or vaginal penetration, according to Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p><strong>JOHN DOE</strong></p>\n<p>Doe denied all of Roe’s accusations.</p>\n<p>He said he arrived at the apartment at approximately 12:30 a.m. that night and was “very intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>By Eyewitness One’s recommendation, he lay down, fully dressed, on the bottom bunk next to Roe because the top bunk was covered in luggage. He reportedly first heard about Doe’s allegations when she “woke [him] up by basically yelling about someone hurting her.”</p>\n<p>He argued three main points in his defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The distance between the couch and the bunk bed in the living room was too close for him to have done anything without being noticed by Eyewitness One and Eyewitness Two.</li>\n<li>He could not have unhooked Roe’s bra because his neurological disorder, a “form of palsy,” affects his motor skills when he is tired or drunk.</li>\n<li>Roe’s antidepressant medication, Viibryd, has side effects including hallucinations, sleep paralysis and night terrors, which can become severe when mixed with alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe was not allowed to include the antidepressant medication evidence in his defense because he did not have an expert present, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The SB Superior Court stated he was not given enough time to find an expert, again showing a lack of due process.</p>\n<p>The full court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/B283229.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The first of the Asks would expand this amount to three.</p>\n<p>“We do think that there’s a disconnect between students and the people who are in the power to make decisions about students,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The second of the Asks requests that UCSB must provide SASA with “the funds to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The reach of the campaign depends on the amount of funding the university provides, Montalvo-Telford added.</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>UC Los Angeles’s (UCLA) <a href=\"https://equity.ucla.edu/public_accountability/public_accountability_reports/\">Public Accountability Report</a> provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“I think that there’s mystery surrounding the Title IX office; we don’t really know what’s going on in there … I think that being at least transparent about the stats of what’s going on in there is comforting, as a student,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final of the Asks says UCSB “must create a paid position for a SASA member to organize an hour long conversation about consent and sexual violence.”</p>\n<p>This position would replace the current Gaucho FYI content on consent and sexual violence, and it would “act as its own subsection of Gaucho FYI.”</p>\n<p>“The way that consent is being taught at Gaucho FYI … limits the way that consent is able to be talked about,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think that consent really stops at ‘yes means yes.’ It’s more than that,” Montolvo-Telford added. “It’s talking about, ‘What does consent actually looks like inside of the bedroom? How do we use it in practice and not just in definition?’”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford believes that the benefit of having a SASA member give the presentation is that a SASA member would have more freedom than a Gaucho FYI presenter.</p>\n<p>“We are able to include things that were necessarily restricted before,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>In theory, a member of SASA would not have these restrictions, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>SASA does not have a set number in mind for the wage of the position.</p>\n<p>The list of Asks has been endorsed by A.S. President Brooke Kopel, External Vice President of Local Affairs Jeike Meijer, Lobby Corps, I Am That Girl, Hermanos, the Armenian Student Association, Making Adventures Possible for All Students (M.A.P.A.S) and Stop the Traffik L.A.</p>\n<p>“As the first woman president that UCSB has had in the past four years, sexual assault issues are at the top of my priorities,” Kopel said in an email. “I unequivocally agreed that each and every one of those asks should and must be implemented by our university administration.”</p>\n<p>SASA is currently working on a resolution with on-campus senator Zion Solomon and off-campus senator Christian Ornelas that endorses the list of Asks, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to have it in front of Senate by next week,” Montalvo-Telford said. “We are prepared to make our argument in support.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the Asks, SASA released the <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/projects/#survey\">results of a survey</a> that was conducted during Spring Quarter 2018. The responses were collected anonymously during a two-week time frame and all participants were associated with UCSB.</p>\n<p>The survey results included data regarding sexual assault, survivors’ reasoning for not reporting, respondents’ knowledge of resources and policies and attitudes toward the university.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to see that the reason why folks chose not to report was because that they felt that the offense was not serious enough,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The data from the survey helped SASA determine how the Asks should be structured, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We definitely believe that all of these Asks are necessary to our campus. What they look like requires a conversation between us and the administration. All of them, in their thesis, are necessary for this campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Food Bank experienced dramatic growth at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, which was a factor in the group’s decision to expand its service, according to A.S. Food Bank Student Coordinator Daniel Yi.</p>\n<p>“The past couple weeks we’ve been easily reaching 500 to 600 new [visitors] per day. That kind of figure is a record figure compared to last year,” Yi said. “That was the peak we were hitting last year. And the first few weeks of this quarter, we’re already at that peak.”</p>\n<p>The record increase in clients has been challenging for the Food Bank, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I have to find the balance between supplying enough food to all our clients but also work[ing] within the limitations of the actual space we have,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>“I think opening a new day and getting more supply pickups should help smooth things out and satisfy our clients’ needs.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was also able to hire more employees to make the expanded hours possible.</p>\n<p>“I currently have 11 active student staff members on my schedule to maintain the pantry and move all of the food –– a handful have been hired in the recent summer and spring quarters, and others have been around for longer,” he said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the location of the Food Bank has historically made it difficult for students to be aware of its existence and informed on its purpose.</p>\n<p>“We’re tucked away on the third floor of the UCen, so people might just not know about the food resources available to them at this campus.”</p>\n<p>Outreach by the Food Bank and its partners could be a factor in its recent growth, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I guess over the last year, our Food Bank committee and a lot of our partners have been doing a really good job of promoting the Food Bank and promoting our resources,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the Food Bank has been using social media to market new developments and products.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been promoting a lot of the exciting items we’re receiving at the Food Bank, as well as special events with our partners. I think some of our developments, like our previous space expansion, new refrigerators and microwaves have also generated quite a bit of buzz for us.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank is funded by a combination of grants and a lock-in student fee, according to Yi. Within student fees, undergraduate students pay five dollars and graduate students pay three dollars at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“We have received grants from TGIF and Global Food Initiative in order to pay for our refrigerators and van,” Food Bank Coordinator Rodolfo Herrera said. “A.S. Finance and Business has also passed for other capital investments in our space.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Food Bank supplies most of the food to the A.S. Food Bank, Herrera said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank’s status as a non-profit allows the organization to receive special prices for assorted dry goods, low prices such as six cents per pound of bread and free produce.</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was seeing roughly 5,000 pounds of food moving in and out before opening on Fridays. With the new hours, this has increased.</p>\n<p>“With Friday open, we are now picking up food five days a week, which should bring us up to around 7,500 to 8,000 pounds per week,” Yi said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that the A.S. Food Bank does not charge students for food, but receives their goods from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank at a discounted price, and to clarify the number of visitors they receive a day. The price of the bread has also been corrected. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Daily Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p>In response to the demands set forth by the protesters, the Department of Black Studies was established.</p>\n<p>The creation of that department paved the way for additional departments such as the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Department of Feminist Studies and the Department of Asian American Studies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think in retrospect that we fully understood or comprehended the significance and the lifetime gravity that that event represented,” Murad Rahman, chair of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1968, said.</p>\n<p>“We certainly by no means did we know and fully understand all of it … maybe until years and years after that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Rahman remembers the events of Oct. 14 that year clearly.</p>\n<p>He and the 11 other students shouldered uncertainty, risk and, most of all, unwavering resolve as they took over North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the time, North Hall held the mainframe computer for the entire UC system and was considered “the most critical point” of the campus, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman and other students attended UCSB during a time of tumultuous social and political climate. Significant moments, such as the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy as well as the rise of prominence of Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement, created the backdrop against which students experienced college life.</p>\n<p>Being among the small number of African American students at the time provided a difficult environment to navigate, Cynthia Davis, secretary for BSU in 1968, recalled.</p>\n<p>“There was a[n] identity crisis because we were such a minority there on campus,” Davis said. “Because of that fact, sort of being isolated like that … we tried to find ways where we could group together to support one another.”</p>\n<p>BSU was an important avenue for African American students to support each other and discuss the challenges they faced as students at UCSB and a minority race in the 1960s, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>Students of BSU worked to raise awareness about issues faced by African American students and fight for changes they felt would benefit their community and black communities throughout the nation, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, a football player in 1968 and one of North Hall Takeover participants, joined forces with Rahman and other BSU members in discussion about what the school needed to be doing better for its black students.</p>\n<p>Several of those discussions revolved around the mistreatment of black athletes on the football team, which included the lack of financial aid given to black athletes in comparison to their white counterparts, the use of derogatory language by coaching staff and the general lack of respect black students were given.</p>\n<p>“We felt that we were being treated differently, and … in that conversation about football, we started looking at the structure of the campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>These complaints, coupled with “racial insensitivity, [and] racial illiteracy” on campus as well as the national social strife at the time, were the final catalyst for the North Hall Takeover, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>In secret – from the public as well as most members of the BSU at the time – Rahman, Nezey and other students devised a plan to secure the computer center at North Hall and demand changes at UCSB from the chancellor at the time, Vernon Cheadle.</p>\n<p>Students planned the “high-risk operation” two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>BSU members located all the exits in the building, prepared for attempted infiltration from police and threats of violence. They also determined how they would communicate and negotiate with key players on the outside.</p>\n<p>Even on the morning of the Takeover, some of the protestors, though resolved in their mission, were apprehensive about what the rest of the day would entail.</p>\n<p>“We knew we were doing the right thing … the question was, how fearful were we of the consequences? That was the issue,” Thomas Crenshaw, one of the protestors, said.</p>\n<p>“Were we fearful? Yeah, we were fearful. Were we afraid? Yeah, we were afraid. There were a lot of us who met to go into North Hall. Only 12 of us showed up.”</p>\n<p>The 12 students arrived at North Hall around 6 a.m. on Oct. 14, when they anticipated the halls would be empty of workers and students. The protestors convinced the few technicians who were present to leave after explaining the gravity of the situation about to take place.</p>\n<p>The students had coordinated a team on the outside to facilitate negotiations at the chancellor’s office while the 12 remained barricaded inside North Hall.</p>\n<p>Booker Banks, another member of the 12 inside the building, addressed the crowd gathered outside the building throughout the day. He kept them both informed and entertained during the negotiations.</p>\n<p>“[Banks] was very, very crucial in making the whole operation a success and in winning over the minds and hearts of students [so] that what we were doing inside and the whole operation was a positive and constructive event,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>It was late afternoon when the 12 received word the chancellor’s office had agreed to the demands.</p>\n<p>“It was a moment of celebration, a moment of relief because we didn’t know whether or not our demands were going to be met,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>50 years later, the North Hall Takeover remains one of the most significant actions take by BSU and has had reverberating effects on campus.</p>\n<p>But the advancements set in motion by these students’ actions were far greater than they could have imagined at the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84425\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84425\" data-attachment-id=\"84425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/50th-anniversary_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"50th anniversary_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84425\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84425\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several of the 12 protestors gathered at UCSB to celebrate the Takeover’s 50th anniversary. <em>Courtesy of Professor Jeffrey Stewart</em></p></div>\n<p>“What’s really amazing to me is to look at all the pictures and see yourself in these pictures at 18, 19 years old not realizing that you’re contributing to history at the time but that you have made history,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>“You feel very proud that you happen to be in the right place at the right time to make such a positive contribution.”</p>\n<p>Many of the participants cite the Takeover as a significant moment in their lives, both shaping their time at UCSB as well as the future they would go on to have.</p>\n<p>“[My involvement] shows and is an indication to my children and my grandchildren as to sacrifices that sometimes have to made in order for progress to be attained,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman now works as a supervising case manager for a community organization in Los Angeles working toward gang prevention.</p>\n<p>Davis also attributes her time in BSU as “stirr[ing] up in me the importance to learn more about my heritage, to be proud of who I was and to be in a position to fight for basic civil rights.”</p>\n<p>She currently works as an assistant professor at Charles R.

Main space as a “safe space for the workers to decompress” for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have the institutional support behind the workers who are really just asking for fair wages and stable benefits,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also asks the Senate to formally endorse the strike and requests the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) have a representative at the strike to offer OSA resources and services for the workers on strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) Grecia Martinez will also be purchasing $600 worth of food and beverages for the workers through the Senate’s unallocated funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate decided to double the original amount requested ($300) after learning that the strike is expecting approximately 500 students per day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also calls upon A.S. President Brooke Kopel and Chancellor Henry T. Yang to write a letter in support of the strike to Janet Napolitano, UCOP (UC Office of the President), the UC Board of Regents and UC Labor Relations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will readily write the letter and consult the authors of the resolution and students that worked on it for input on the letter,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second resolution, authored by Palmerin and Briseno, calls for an A.S. “work stoppage” in support of the strike. It promises to compensate the A.S. student workers who sign in at the strike and miss their shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. entities that will be affected by the work stoppage include the A.S Bike Shop, A.S. Recycling, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Zero Waste Committee, A.S. Publications and the A.S Main building, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilities including the A.S. Food Bank and the A.S. Legal Resource Center will not be closed due to the nature of the services they provide for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also requires no police presence in A.S. Main for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third resolution, authored by Cornejo and Uribe, encourages student workers to strike in solidarity and “endorses the usage of any and all AS resources in providing aid” to students who do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the resolution presented by Solomon and Toubian, this resolution also requires OSA to offer several services including “information relating to University rights, protocols, and procedures, information on strikes and protests rights and procedures, information on appeals processes, and referrals to local legal representation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) plans to strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25 to protest a “year and a half of deadlocked negotiations [and] concerns about growing racial and gender disparities within UC’s workforce,” according to a press release from AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous undergraduate and graduate students spoke at public forum, calling for the A.S. Senate to pass the resolutions and personally show their support by showing up at the picket line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s time for you to support us, so that we can support you,” Juan Donato, lead groundskeeper and Member Action Team for AFSCME, said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It also focuses these resources toward students from low-income communities, with the hope of giving them a higher chance of attending college and becoming productive members of the workforce.</p>\n<p>“We have some serious issues on the planet that must be solved soon, and students with a good education can be positioned to be part of that solution,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1985, originally got involved with the organization as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>He worked as a tutor for the program during his college years and went on to take a temporary job doing outreach following his graduation.</p>\n<p>After continuing his education at Cal State Northridge and the University of La Verne, he eventually returned to UCSB in 2000 to become EAOP Director.</p>\n<p>“We need more students to participate in higher ed. Our economy needs a highly educated workforce and we are helping that process,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>When the EAOP was first created, its intent was to diversify the student body of UC campuses by providing resources to racial minorities.</p>\n<p>Over the years, its focus has shifted to targeting low-income, first-generation students who do not have readily available access to college services. The program now spans three counties and soon will be serving 11 high schools.</p>\n<p>“The idea was to increase college enrollment rates from these schools that were usually associated with low-income communities that don’t always have the same resources to prepare for college,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>With over 2,000 students enrolled in its cohort, the program’s services reach a wide range of students, including those at the middle and elementary school levels.</p>\n<p>EAOP’s welcoming atmosphere is evident through its dedicated staff. Mirka Lopez, a first-generation student herself, works as college-site coordinator for the program.</p>\n<p>“[The EAOP] gives them that motivation and encouragement because sometimes they don’t think they belong at a UC, or they’ve never set foot on a college campus,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>“Through this program they get the opportunity to explore their options and learn what kind of resources there are.”</p>\n<p>The program also has several student interns on staff, allowing UCSB students to serve as role models for under-represented teenagers.</p>\n<p>For Daniel Segura, a second-year sociology major and EAOP intern, the program is especially meaningful.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot to me because I was a part of EAOP myself in high school, so my first experiences with college were through the program,” Segura said.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re interns, we get to see those effects on other kids, seeing them believe that college is actually possible because someone like them actually made it.”</p>\n<p>However, EAOP has endured its share of struggles over the years, including several budget and staff cuts.</p>\n<p>Staff went from 23 to nine in the mid-2000s, and EAOP suffered additional monetary cuts due to the fluctuating economy, according to Ortiz.</p>\n<p>EAOP began a using new budget model in 2007 that shares costs with its school sites to help run the program. They now use a “Dual Service Model,” aiming resources toward all students, regardless of their indicated college interest level.</p>\n<p>“So in essence, we cover the entire school. We don’t just raise the cohort’s college-going rate, we aim at raising the graduating class’s college-going rates,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>UCSB EAOP also recently trained UCLA and UCR EAOPs to replicate its model, hoping to impact not only the surrounding community but also the state as a whole.</p>\n<p>The program’s influence was made clear on Friday during a college-readiness event, which gave dozens of low-income and first-generation high school students a first look at UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>During this event, UCSB undergraduate volunteers gave tours and provided advice to the aforementioned students.</p>\n<p>“[EAOP] is changing the world one school at a time,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Lopez’s first name is Mirka, not Lirka. </em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: UCSB EAOP is training other UC’s to “replicate” its model, not “respect” its model. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change.

id=\"caption-attachment-84302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IVCSD board members also expressed concerns about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters. <em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD has taken a “hands off” approach to the regulation of scooters on campus so far, despite requests for them to “heavily impound” the scooters, according to Matt Bowman, UCPD Acting Lieutenant, who spoke at Tuesday’s I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The scooters are currently categorized under the title of motor vehicles, according to Bowman, who says a citation for riding a Bird on campus could cost $250.</p>\n<p>Bowman says that officers are doing “limited enforcement” of scooters and responding on a complaint basis.</p>\n<p>Despite this, students have ridden the scooters on campus with little to no consequences.</p>\n<p>To better regulate these policies, UCSB formed a committee which includes several university organizations such as Associated Students, UCPD and Transportation and Parking Services among others, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB’s policy coordinator and deputy ADA compliance officer.</p>\n<p>The Committee is considering geofencing as one form of regulation, which would shut off scooters once they pass a certain geographical location, said Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach at the Graduate Student Association meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s case, this could be Pardall Tunnel, Lubach said.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD meeting on Oct. 9, Bird City Launcher Benjamin Jacobs discussed Bird’s plans to institute a “no-ride zone” for campus on the Bird app.</p>\n<p>“People will… get a notification that they’re entering a no-ride zone which we can tag based on [the university’s] requirements,” Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>The company currently does not have plans to throttle the scooters entering campus.</p>\n<p>Bird also plans to hire members of the I.V. community as “bird sweepers or watchers” who would manage the removal of Bird scooters on campus as well as educating users on how to safely operate the product, Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members also expressed concern about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters.</p>\n<p>As an example of the I.V. CSD’s worries about the scooters, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman pointed out that a Bird scooter had washed up onto the beach over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In response, Jacobs said the initial sign-up process on Bird’s app requires users to watch a video that explains the rules of scooter use, which includes riding only on streets, wearing a helmet and limiting the number of persons per scooter to one.</p>\n<p>Jacobs also added that safety is a “priority” for the Bird company.</p>\n<p>The company is also considering taking the scooters off streets in I.V. during periods when high alcohol consumption among residents is likely, he said. This effort would be in hopes of reducing the amount of people operating Bird scooters while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD said Santa Barbara County plans to set regulations regarding the use of scooters in unincorporated territory, such as I.V., in November.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 9, 2019]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“This project has been something that we’ve been really actively working on for about four years, although it was in our minds even before that,” Maynard said. “In order to get to this stage, we’ve had to work with so many different people.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</p>\n<p>“A recent survey showed that 48% of undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed reported experiencing food insecurity in the past year,” Margaret Klawunn, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, said in a speech at the farm’s groundbreaking event on West Campus.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re starting an effort that will help to reclaim food waste and create food for students who need it the most.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will produce far more food than any of the Edible Campus Program’s current projects. However, she was not able to give an estimate on how much food that would be.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to put an exact number on how much we will produce as we are proposing an innovative approach, mother nature is not always predictable, and we haven’t started farming yet,” Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>The construction of the farm will go through December and the beds for the farm will be built in the winter. The Edible Campus Program will be able to start planting in the spring, Maynard said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed.</p>\n<p>“We registered 2,697 students in the last academic year for Calfresh and now we’re creating the space for students to grow their own food through campus gardens and farms,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>The food will be picked on the farm and delivered to the pantries on the same day, according to Alex Moon, Edible Campus Program student coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our farm is built on a garden movement that stretches back over 40 years at UCSB and even longer in Isla Vista,” Moon said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “We are so lucky to be a part of a university which celebrates student leadership and engages students in the shared governance of our community.”</p>\n<p>“As students, we are given the rare opportunity to dream up new ideas and test them right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the new farm, the Edible Campus Program is also working on vertical hydroponic gardens at the UCSB Recreation Center, an urban orchard at Storke Plaza and an urban agriculture educational series.</p>\n<p>“It takes many hands to make the vision for the student farm a reality,” Chancellor Yang said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “This farm will be a vital part of our campus food initiative and also our proud sustainability practices.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Kopel selected Justin Nilsen, former solicitor general for the attorney general’s office, to fill the position of chairman.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council is made up of one chairman, four members and one advisor, the latter of who does not vote on decisions, according to its website.</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, two of the three members, Matthew Lanthier and Roshni Sopariwalla, graduated, leaving Raymond Alonso, a current second-year political science and history of public policy major, as the only member on the council.</p>\n<p>Currently, the council has one active petition and one order of business to address relating to the position of EVPSA as well as allegations of campaign violations committed by Campus United (CU) that could disqualify all CU senators as well as Kopel.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting Wednesday night, Kopel said she had been holding off on appointing students to the council for several reasons. For one, she is charged with filling four seats for positions that students hold until they graduate.</p>\n<p>“Once you’re on, you’re making decisions for potentially four years, and that’s why I don’t take it lightly,” Kopel said. “That’s why I want to make sure that since I’ve been in the random situation that four new seats have opened when I’ve become president, I want to make sure that the best people and the fairest people are appointed, and that comes with time.”</p>\n<p>She also stated that of previous applicants, none of the students she reached out to had responded, leaving her no choice but to start up another round of applications during the summer.</p>\n<p>Currently the Committee on Committees (COC) is reviewing the applications. Once they conduct interviews they will make their recommendations to Kopel, who plans on conducting her own set of interviews as well.</p>\n<p>As for Nilsen, Kopel said she has known him since his freshman year through their involvement with mock trial.</p>\n<p>“I worked with him a lot, and saw how smart that dang kid is,” she said. “Really the drive he has for advocacy, and just judiciary in general, and so when he expressed interest to me in being on judicial council, I really considered him, knowing already what I knew about him and also looking at his answers to the questions that everybody else filled out.”</p>\n<p>Kopel stressed the importance of filling up the Judicial Council so that any open cases could be properly addressed.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting, Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe requested that the Senate be allowed to question Kopel’s appointments before approving them, referencing the fact that Nilsen was unable to be present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>After moving the item into discussion, senators debated the merits of questioning the presidential appointments, a practice Kopel said was historically unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Marisela Marquez, Associated Students (A.S.) executive director, said that while in recent history, presidential appointments have not been scrutinized as heavily, there has been a past of senators questioning the selections.</p>\n<p>As Senate moved into discussion regarding Nilsen’s appointment, many agreed that they would like the opportunity to get to know him before making decisions that would affect their constituents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to respect Brooke and her appointments, [but] we should be able to ask questions…we should just be 100% confident that they will be able to do their job, nonbiased,” said Senator Christian Ornelas. “I just think it would be irresponsible not to ask questions.”</p>\n<p>As they took their vote to table the appointment until they would be able to question Nilsen, Proxy Rose Ettleson asked the Senate to commit themselves to the same process for future candidates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
