Bike Committee worked with Bike Committee Senate Liaison and On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal to develop the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution includes a letter written by the Associated Students (A.S.) Bike Committee, which oversees maintenance of campus bicycle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The letter criticizes the lack of bicycle parking and infrastructure in the newest design plan for the Student Resource Building (SRB) North Landscaping Design Project. The development plan for the lawn area north of the SRB and south of the bike path would provide more space in the SRB and expand outdoor study space, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s vote is in solidarity with the A.S. Bike Committee’s letter, and directs the SRB Governance Board to consider their request to put the project on hold until the design includes improvements to the SRB’s bicycle system.</p>\n<p>The resolution emphasizes how the current bicycle parking situation at the SRB threatens the safety of the campus. Because the bicycle parking lot for the Theater and Dance West building is across the bike path, accessing the SRB is “challenging and dangerous during peak hours,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that current parking “poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space.”</p>\n<p>The Bike Committee first became involved with the North Landscaping Design Project in Spring Quarter 2017, and worked with the SRB Governance Board to add bike parking to their original design.</p>\n<p>“The [previous] design included space for approximately 35 bike parking spaces near the SRB main entrance. This space has been eliminated in the most recent proposal, and the Bike Committee hopes that it will be added back in,” A.S. Bike Committee Chair Annie Golay said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and SRB Governance Board Advisor Kim Equinoa said the changes sacrificed more bike parking for programming and study space.</p>\n<p>“The scope was narrowed to include one design area encompassing the grass area north of SRB and south of the bike path. In that transition, the space was designed to maximize programming and study space,” Equinoa said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>When the A.S. Bike Committee found out the newest design plan did not include new bike space, they wrote a letter directly to the SRB Governance Board detailing why new bike parking is necessary for the SRB.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who wish to go to the Student Resource Building must park in the bike lot adjacent to the Theater and Dance West building. This poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>In response to the resolution, Equinoa said “the SRB Governance Board is open to receiving any feedback and information that can help inform decisions.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me is a national nonprofit organization that “automatically and anonymously matches peers to create texting networks of instantaneous support,” according to the organization’s <a href=\"https://lean0n.me/\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rushali Kothari, a third-year biological sciences major, founded UCSB’s chapter this past fall quarter and now serves as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a 24/7, anonymous, peer-to-peer support text line. Anyone can text in at any time, and a trained student supporter will respond,” Kothari said. “It’s just a way to vent, or if you need to get something off your chest and you feel like you can’t go to anyone else, this is very easy and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kothari heard about Lean On Me from a friend at another university and decided to bring the organization to UCSB. UCSB is the first UC to have a Lean On Me chapter, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The national organization handled the logistical end of setting up the hotline, Kothari said. Kothari and the rest of Lean On Me’s executive board act as the people “on the ground” who publicize the hotline and help train the student supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Lean On Me chapter spent the second half of Winter Quarter and the first half of Spring Quarter recruiting the 18 student supporters who are responsible for responding to the texts that are sent to the hotline. The application process involved both an online application and an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student supporter went through a four-hour online training session provided by the national organization, along with a three-hour in-person workshop led by Lean On Me executive board members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The online training was a lot about empathy and vulnerability and just being open to listening to people,” Kothari said. “The workshop training was more hands-on. We went through a lot of different scenarios.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main two things are validating responses and validating how a person feels and how you do that, and then asking open-ended questions. Let the person… tell you what they want to tell you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training also involved educating the student supporters about other resources in the local area so that they are able to refer people who text the hotline to those resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have systems in place if something does seem very serious… they’d alert the national team and get the person’s phone number if they’re in danger and then we can give that phone number to UCPD to get the person help if need be,” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone texts the hotline, they have to agree to a list of terms and conditions before a student supporter can reach out to them. 30 people have texted the hotline since its launch on Monday, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were just testing it out the first day. The text was like ‘hey, I’m just testing this out to see if it’s real,’ and we’d be like ‘yeah, it’s real, it’s working, you’ve got us!’” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people have been using it for what it’s meant for, whether they’re stressed, they have mild mental health issues, eating disorders, family grief, whatever it might be, and we’re here to help.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Talbert, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, is one of the 18 student supporters. She has exchanged texts with two people since the hotline’s launch on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main point is to make sure they know that there’s a lot of resources out there and that this is a good starting point if they need to go further, and if not, this is a good place to just… talk it out, basically,” Talbert said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some text conversations have lasted more than a day, while some are as short as 30 minutes, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To publicize the hotline, Lean On Me has been tabling in the Arbor and plans to put up flyers around campus and Isla Vista soon, Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me also wants to form partnerships with Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and UCSB Health &amp; Wellness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has a lot of their own problems and their own things that they’re dealing with and sometimes it’s not easy to tell a friend or find someone to help you,” Kothari said. “C.A.P.S. is a great resource for sure but it can’t handle such a large school and the large amount of students that we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hotline’s number is (805) 874-5888.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said there were 12 student supporters.

routes in Santa Barbara and Goleta to improve the timing and efficiency of routes. The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand. Even now, these buses are still reaching capacity and leaving people behind, according to Blackerby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hopes the additional line 28 bus will relieve the overcrowding problems on other El Colegio buses, such as lines 7, 11 and 24x.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

As an “alternative,” the $3.33 per quarter fee was proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/58384528_321304875200897_6072833742202732544_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1218723404\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87908\">“in order to continue providing night and weekend parking for students.”</a></p>\n<p>For the next five years, until around 2008, the permits were provided to students at no additional cost other than the $3.33 fee, according to Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) Director Nestor Covarrubias.</p>\n<p>But it’s 2019, and students are still paying that $3.33 per quarter fee – without the free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, students have had to pay money on top of the $3.33 per quarter fee if they want night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>The $3.33 fee is currently being used to “partially cover” the full cost of a night and weekend parking permit, which stands at $160 for community members and $52.50 for students for three quarters, Covarrubias said in an email to the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>If that fee went away, students would pay the full $160, he confirmed.</p>\n<p>It was the discovery that the initial ballot language promised students “free” night and weekend parking that prompted A.S. President Brooke Kopel to post on her personal Facebook on April 22, encouraging UCSB students to vote no on the TPS $3.33 reaffirmation fee that was on the Spring Quarter 2019 ballot.</p>\n<p>“I have attempted to re-implement this free night and weekend parking that TPS has promised us. In conversations with A.S. staff, I have discovered that over the years since this lock-in was passed, TPS claims that the $3.33 fee is just no longer enough to supplement free night and weekend parking due to their own institutional growth and expansion,” Kopel said in the post.</p>\n<p>“BUT that is not what YOU pay for. YOU pay for FREE night and weekend parking. Not subsidized night and weekend parking.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Kopel explained that her predecessor, former A.S. President Hieu Le, attempted to “strong arm” TPS into providing students with free night and weekend parking toward the end of his term by asking A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez not to give TPS the money collected by student fees.</p>\n<p>Once Kopel took office, she said she was told by Márquez that A.S. cannot legally withhold that money from TPS.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s ballot language that was voted on and approved by the student body that this money will be paid to TPS, even though they’re not giving exactly what the ballot language says, Marisela can’t just withhold funds that students voted on giving to a department,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really, really irresponsible of Associated Students to be letting students pay $10 a year for a service they are not receiving. $10 could be a few meals, $10 could go to rent, $10 could go to gas, to books.”</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the fee was reaffirmed with 3901 yeses, or 71.79%, and 1533 noes, or 28.21%. It cannot be voted on again until Spring Quarter 2021.</p>\n<p>If A.S. was “open to the idea,” Covarrubias said, “TPS could come up with an updated rate to provide the undergraduate Night &amp; Weekend permit at no additional cost.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [1:15 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Barbara’s Pan Asian Network and Indus, an on-campus group for South Asian culture and awareness, joined hands to put on a vigil attended by about 80 people. Throughout the vigil, organizers and speakers brought to light both the stories of the people who died as well as the strength, resilience and compassion of the Sri Lankan community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight speakers took the stage that night, which included a handful of UCSB students as well as a high school student from the Santa Barbara area. Several faculty members and administrators also took time to share their sentiments, including Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, director of the MultiCultural Center, Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vigil organizers passed out small, battery-operated blue light candles, which attendees switched on as they were placed in their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Dhishal Jayasinghe was one of the first to take the stage, during which he spoke about his childhood and various identities as a “Singhalese, Buddhist, Sri Lankan, American, asylum seeker who came here at the age of three years old fleeing war.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jayasinghe described his gratefulness for the people who showed up to support the bombing victims and urged the audience members to reject the destructive ideals of nationalism and instead opt for unity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Shobha Ambi, who spoke after Jayasinghe, shared her “frustration and sadness” with the crowd, tearing up as she expressed her disbelief at the scale of the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any life lost is heartbreaking enough, but 253 lives is overwhelming on an entirely different level,” Ambi said. “My heart hurts for the victims whose lives were taken away so unjustly and for their families who are forced to deal with the consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ambi recounted the stories of some of those who lost their lives on April 21, including that of an 11-year-old child. Ambi said she was disappointed by the lack of focus she saw on the victims of the attack, with more attention seeming to go toward the attackers and the Sri Lankan government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Does no one comprehend the death of how many lives were ripped away just four days ago? 253 lives,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She echoed sentiments similar to that of Jayasinghe, stating that one doesn’t need to be Sri Lankan to understand the tragedy suffered by the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These weren’t just the lives of Sri Lankans that were taken away. These were the lives of human beings,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87792\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-87792\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87792\" data-attachment-id=\"87792\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1313&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1313\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"A vigil goer holding the LED candle distributed by the organizer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C583&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87792\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C583\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vigil organizers passed out blue light candles. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB student, Huda Faiz, took the stage next, expressing her love for Sri Lanka at  the beginning of her speech. Faiz said that now, many people know her home only for the tragedies that have taken place there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Faiz, it’s something much different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sri Lanka to you is 253 lives that were lost and counting,” she said. “But Sri Lanka to me is the birds singing at the break of dawn. It’s the old man selling vegetables rolling his cart down my street calling for buyers at 6 a.m. It’s the fresh smell of morning tea and home-cooked coconut rice wafting from my aunt’s kitchen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the community of Sri Lanka is one that is built upon principles of love, tolerance, acceptance and resilience. For Faiz, the power of the community to unite against the forces of intolerance is something that should be seen before the tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz stressed the power that can be harnessed with love and community. She finished her portion with a Christian prayer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the vigil, Jayasinghe returned to the microphone to share his thanks to the organizers of the event and the attendees. Attendees then returned their candles to a table in the center, where the small blue lights shone in the shape of the number 253.</span></p>\n<p>Further photos from the vigil can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biography is the culmination of decades of work, Stewart said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart began research on Locke in 1977 while in graduate school at Yale University. He dropped the project for a long period of time but resumed writing the biography in 1992.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went away from it because it was so challenging … It was a very complex project. I didn’t feel like early on, coming out of graduate school, I could write the book. I had to grow as a writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart made use of Howard University’s exhaustive collection of Locke’s personal correspondences to paint a picture of Locke’s philosophy, life experiences, conflicts and interpersonal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professor at Howard University, Locke left the bulk of his letters with the institution, where they were compiled in the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart pored over thousands of documents in the process of writing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He has voluminous letters. He had probably 5000 letters to his mother alone… He would report on what he did and where he went almost like a diary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike historical counterparts such as Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on social advancement through economic efficacy and protest respectively, Locke looked at the arts and saw an opportunity to connect white audiences with Black creators, Stewart said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s like a facilitator. He’s like a producer of these things. He did it out of a belief that art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke popularized the works of Black artists and authors such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and others who “started doing poems and short stories and novels about the Black experience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that “art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost like a Trojan Horse, [art] could be rode into the citadel of American culture and there would be poetry and art and all about Black people which would humanize how people thought about Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke faced challenges relating to his disposition, his size, his sexuality and his focus on art over other forms of activism. In the greater Black cultural narrative, Stewart believes Locke was overlooked because of these peculiarities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take somebody like Frederick Douglass. He’s independent, a leader, a spokesperson. He’s heterosexual, he has a family. It’s like it’s the mirror of the white world, but Black. Locke was small. He was 4’11″. He weighed 99 pounds. He was into art, which is not typically the focus of Black politics. He was a difficult personality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke’s challenges gave him a unique perspective on life, and his success and resilience in the face of dismissiveness from other activists inspired Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never let the opposition from other people stop him, whether it was gendered or sexual, or racial, or even the issue of his size, or those people who thought that art was ridiculous to be concerned about when you’re in the midst of a racial struggle.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87719\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1536383264\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87708\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87719\" data-attachment-id=\"87719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-professor-wins-pulitzer-prize/unnamed-1-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"335,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=335%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also significant to Stewart was Locke’s faith in the Black cultural capacity for change and reinvention, away from the ideals and standards imposed by white people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that in altering one’s conception of oneself and embracing one’s innate qualities as a Black person, one could “acquire and gain a sense of self-esteem and agency that [one could] never acquire by trying to get what the other people have,” Stewart said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So there’s a narrative of self-sufficiency and self-determination through art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke also led a life of lonesomeness which intensified after the death of the most prominent figure in Locke’s life: his mother.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of his life was after her death in 1922, a search for someone to replace her… and he never found that,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was coupled with a desire for a meaningful relationship with a man, which Locke could never fulfill, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had relationships but never anything that was really permanent. He felt people would get with him because of what he could do for them, they used him. He was a means, not an end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke was a perpetual optimist deep down, even in his dying moments. In every aspect of his life, whether it be romantic pursuits, academic ambitions or social activism, Locke never let seemingly insurmountable disadvantages discourage him, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart believes young people can learn from Locke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That kind of relates to today, I think. A lot of young people come out and look at the situation. There’s a lot of controversy… but [Locke] was always hopeful, always thinking that by contributing you could make a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This signature concept of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The New Negro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Black people reinvented themselves in the 20th century, away from slavery… There’s this idea that wherever you are in your life, whatever has happened, you still have the capacity for a new version of yourself,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His whole thing is, well, if you believe you can change, then maybe you can.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Hall. </span><i>Courtesy of JP Celestino</i></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protestors gathered outside of Cheadle Hall where speakers from Pan Asian Network, Asian Pacific Islander Graduate Student Association (APIGSA) and the Asian American Studies Department spoke about their experiences at the university and grievances they hold with the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers talked about the lack of resources allocated for Asian and Asian American students on campus, with some noting that almost one third of UCSB’s student population identifies as Asian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smita Narasimhan, social media coordinator for Pan Asian Network, talked about the failure of the university to recognize the many identities within the label of Asian or Asian American. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from so many diverse cultures, languages, religions and we need to embrace all of that, but by designating all of us under one umbrella with one word, that’s taking all those differences away,” Narasimhan said during the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narasimhan said she hopes the fulfillment of the demands will create a campus where her Asian identity will be acknowledged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe at the end of this, I can feel comfortable calling myself Asian again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor of Asian American studies, also spoke at the rally, urging students to “mobilize and organize” to create the changes needed for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fujino said that not only do the 2019 demands build upon the Asian and Asian-American community demands in 2017 and the Black Student Union demands from </span><a

marched into Cheadle Hall and chanted in protest while ascending the stairs to the fifth floor, where Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Executive Assistant in the Office of the Chancellor Diane O’Brien received the list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pan Asian Network members then listed the staff they required to be present at the meeting and requested that a meeting to discuss the demands with the Chancellor Henry T. Yang be held on Friday, May 3.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said the demands and the request for the meeting would be passed on to Chancellor Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the meeting date is not fulfilled, Pan Asian Network and other groups plan to take stronger action to compel the university to meet their demands, according to Donna Anderson, member of APIGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If that doesn’t happen, if Chancellor Yang is unable to make that possible, then it turns into direct action. It’s gonna be more rallies, more advocacy, greater activism on campus and we won’t be silent. We’re not gonna let this go,” Anderson said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Anderson, the demands come down to an essential problem with how the Asian and Asian-American communities are seen on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are invisible.

Following his first year, he said he  “began to continue to fall in love with our community and work closely with the I.V. CRC, the Teen Center and Community Services District.” Furthermore, Griffin also worked to help students who were displaced by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliff collapses on Del Playa Drive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also owns his own aerial photography company where he takes pictures for “landlords and property management services.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, a current off-campus senator, stated he is already working closely with the EVPLA office and is close friends with the current EVPLA, Jeike Meijer. Through his connections with the EVPLA and the office, Ornelas said “[Meijer is] constantly helping me learn more about her office and just the kind of work [that the] EVPLA should be doing, and how the EVPLA can be responsive to community needs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on representing the diversity of the I.V. community, as “we are representing a diverse amount of people, both students and non-students… so it’s really important that you’re able to connect with different communities because we all share Isla Vista and it’s really pertinent to make sure that their voices are uplifted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One question posed by Elections Board referenced Wi-Fi in I.V. Parks; despite previous efforts, the implementation of free Wi-Fi in the parks has yet to see any tangible progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas provided two possible solutions: build routers into park benches or take advantage of “innovative companies that utilize satellites to ping Wi-Fi to certain areas.” However, Ornelas does not guarantee he will be able to make either of these undertakings happen, noting that the term length is not favorable to larger projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin, on the other hand, believes this may be a better job for the I.V. CSD, where he has already established “creative relationships” with some of the directors, such as Father Jon Hedges. Griffin finds that the I.V. CSD would be a more appropriate place to take on the project because they have the “space for transition projects” which can be implemented over the “course of a few years,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are familiar with the I.V. CSD, the local government representing I.V. But Griffin has worked closely with current I.V. CSD directors Ethan Bertrand and Spencer Brandt in the past; Ornelas admitted that he hasn’t “been super involved in their [I.V. CSD] meetings,” but plans to be more involved in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brought up by the Elections Board, community outreach is a cornerstone of the EVPLA position, as it is imperative to take into account the diversity of I.V. while also acting as a liaison between the community and the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, who speaks fluent Spanish, stressed the importance of having a diverse office and proposed the idea of creating a community outreach team to better connect with the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community outreach has a different meaning to Griffin, who has spent the past two years curating a series of interviews with long-term residents of I.V. called “The People of Isla Vista.” Griffin plans to continue this work, if elected, so he can devise a way to produce more inclusive programs that stretch out to those not necessarily affiliated with the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a contentious issue that seems to never be completely remediated, is seen as a problem by both Ornelas and Griffin, although their solutions are not the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having had worked with the EVPLA office in the past, Griffin sees street lighting as a project for the I.V. CSD – one in which the EVPLA can help supplement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My plan would be to work with them [I.V. CSD]… to go out and find where more lights need to be implemented. And then working with the county and other organizations come up with a concrete plan to install lights in areas that are not fairly lit,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, on the other hand, is a fan of the ongoing efforts of the EVPLA office and its recent release of a street lighting expansion </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ornelas believes the work should remain in the office to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and restarting the project somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas also plans to collaborate with county supervisor Joan Hartmann to “represent our voices at the county level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an increase in attendance but a decrease in arrests, the elections board asked if it may be possible to remove Deltopia’s festival ordinance in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates agree that instead of abandoning the ordinance entirely, it should be adjusted and scaled down accordingly. Furthermore, Ornelas is weary that if Deltopia becomes a sanctioned, “actual event,” there is the possible repercussion that visitors from other colleges might see the change as a potential advertisement to draw attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is opposed to advertising Deltopia as a real event as well, fearing that it will draw crowds from other schools who see it as an “exclusive event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board also asked if the candidates believe the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community naloxone trainings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> implemented in I.V. have been successful in helping residents learn how to use naloxone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are in favor of seeing the program expand more. Ornelas, who has attended a training, plans to push for Community Service Officers (CSOs) to also have naloxone on hand, as they currently do not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about their plans to fight against sexual assault, Griffin and Ornelas proposed different approaches to the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas believes the best approach is to listen to the needs of the community. He also cited “really close relationships with folks in students against sexual assault” and the fact that Standing Together To End Sexual Assault (STESA), a college advocate program for sexual assault survivors, recently approached the I.V CSD for funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin plans to work directly with the I.V. CSD to implement more Green Dot trainings, which help educate students on sexual assault and violence. On top of that, Griffin also hopes to bring the Blue Light system to I.V., which he believes will make the community feel safer at night and speed up police response times by having numerous emergency alarms around I.V. that will alert police if activated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last on the list of questions was the subject of food insecurity and its disproportionate effect on marginalized students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on strengthening the services of the A.S. Food Bank and CalFresh. As a vice chair on A.S. Finance and Business, Orneals stated that “there’s honestly a lot of room for improvement in how money can be used more efficiently. So really making sure that we’re reevaluating the budget and allocating that to programs that people really need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is in favor of expanding the services of the A.S. Food Bank because he feels “not everybody can access it or not everybody knows about it, who is food insecure.” He would also like to work with local grocery stores to create a food bank that gives nearly-expired food for free to students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Austin Foreman, a first-year pre-biology major and Emma Swanson, a first-year physics major, are running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaz and Swanson did not attend the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The questions asked by Elections Board and answered by the candidates are below: </span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first priority be if elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said his first priority would be to implement a committee that would create a digital library of textbooks so students wouldn’t have to purchase textbooks every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would make sure Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has more “initiative to reduce the waitlist times.” </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system with campaigning affect the way you take office? Will you be able to work effectively with members of the other party? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said polarization is a “huge issue” in the Senate, and said it’s important to be bipartisan and make sure senators are “reaching the needs of the student body instead of being focused on just our parties.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said this will not be an issue. He said he would work to fulfill students’ needs regardless of party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>For someone who is unfamiliar with the way A.S. works and what an on-campus senator does, could you explain what you do and what do you plan to do once you take office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman explained that students each pay approximately $600 toward A.S., which makes up a total budget of about $14 million. He said he is looking to use the money toward fixing the bike paths and implementing a system to maintain the paths, as well as increasing funding for mental health resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas echoed Foreman’s explanation of what A.S. is, adding that senators write bills and resolutions that focus on helping students’ needs. She said she would love to work on implementing workshops in all the dorm halls that would address financial aid, mental health, anti-blackness and “anything to the needs of the students that I think would really help them branch out and understand how to navigate college life.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times first years or even fourth years people can struggle with the stress of college life or guilt for not being there to pay and provide for their families. But I think it’s really important that if this happens or if a student is struggling, that they are referred to a program or know about the resources they have here at UCSB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Serving on the Senate is an extremely large time commitment. Just last week Senate had a meeting that ran for over 10 hours. Senators are expected to be present at various BCU meetings and have several other responsibilities as well. If you are elected, do you believe you will be able to dedicate yourself to the position and the time commitment that is needed? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she will dedicate her time and effort to the Senate, as well as the Boards Commissions &amp; Units (BCU) meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m the type of leader who doesn’t overpower voices. I’m the type of leader who would love to sit down with a person and talk and hear their needs and the responsibilities they believe the A.S. Senate should have. In order to implement that, that requires time and effort… I want others to tell me what they need from me and work and collaborate with them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he will be able to fulfill the time commitment required, stating he is very “time management oriented.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also look forward to sitting on Senate regardless of the length of the meeting and following and learning the procedures of Senate… I love to liason for meetings and learn about all the different organizations on our campus and the diversity and what they wish to see in Senate.” </span></p>\n<p><b>This past year, the price to live in a double room with a 14 meal plan increased by approximately $500 dollars. What will you do to address increasing costs and make living in the dorms more affordable for on-campus students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he believes financial security is a “very important issue that is pressing our students at the moment.” He admitted that he is “not very educated on the cost of dorm living and the meal plan increase” but said he hopes to be educated on that once he takes his Senate seat. He repeated his plan to implement the open-source textbook program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said the rising cost of tuition is a “really prevalent problem.” To address this, she said meals swipes should be transferable and shared among students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Reports of on-campus sexual assault and dating violence have been on the rise during recent years. What would you do to address sexual violence on campus, and most importantly, how would you support and advocate for survivors?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would like to implement a faster emergency response system, so when students are walking from the library to Isla Vista, or from Isla Vista to the dorms, there is an “earlier response to their needs.” She added that she would like to implement a policy that would enforce harsher punishment on assaulters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said that he, along with other Campus United candidates, want to implement a Blue Light system in I.V. He added that there should be an office on campus that survivors can go to and speak to someone about what happened to them, and report on the issue “so that it can be addressed and that the assaulter be reprimanded and [so] that it does not happen again.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any leadership or work experience relating to UCSB Housing and Dining? For example, experience with RHA, or a job in the dorms, or the dining commons. If you do, how would you use your past experience to help you in your new position. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he is the Queer-Trans Student engagement chair in the Santa Catalina South Hall council. In that position, he works to “create space spaces where people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, and all factors can come and enjoy themselves and express themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would take this experience and bring that to Senate and make it a place where diversity is welcomed and can thrive,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she does not have an experience with UCSB housing or dining, but said she has experience as an intern for CalPerg and worked on the affordable textbooks campaign. She added that she has experience in Hermanas Unidas. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

What will you do to contribute to making UCSB a space where LGBTQ students feel safe in their communities, specifically in your college? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collegiate Senators have duties specific to their college. For example, according to Legal Code, College of L&amp;S senators are supposed to meet with one of their college deans twice every quarter and the College of Engineering Senator is supposed to serve as a chair of the College of Engineering Student Council. Those are just two of the many duties assigned to collegiate senators.

In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students could favorite classes they want to take before their pass times. Do you believe G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter.

This incident was reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it shows that even on-campus education buildings are not immune to antisemitism. As a collegiate senator, how would you attempt to combat antisemitism and ensure that people from all backgrounds are heard, valued and respected? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responses to the issues presented by the questions, as well as candidates’ general goals, are summarized below:</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Engineering Candidates: </b></p>\n<p><b>Lim,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a first-year chemical engineering major, believes that the greatest issue facing students in the College of Engineering is the stigma regarding mental health services. He said that, if elected, he wants to promote mental health awareness and wellness campaigns. Lim added that he is currently a part of the AIChE club at UCSB, which is a chemical engineering club; through that, he has experience in communicating with professors and students within his college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also wants to make a phone app geared toward S.T.E.M. and engineering students that would compile an inventory of different resources on campus that are “available to help people with their academic studies.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Reyes Carrillo, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year computer science major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is accessibility to certain technologies. If elected, Reyes Carrillo plans to advocate for lendable laptops and 3D printers. Reyes Carrillo also said that she believes the two-party system should not exist, which is why she chose to run independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of how Reyes Carrillo would uplift the voices of LGBTQ students in her college, she mentioned the need for advocating for organizations such as oSTEM, which is an organization at UCSB aimed at promoting and supporting LGBTQ individuals in S.T.E.M. fields. Reyes Carrillo added that she believes the College of Engineering should have two senatorial seats. </span></p>\n<p><b>College of Letters and Science Candidates:</b></p>\n<p><b>Danielzadeh, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is over-enrollment. Danielzadeh wants to modify G.O.L.D. and update the waitlist system so that students with “upper standing who need certain classes to graduate on time have priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When meeting with the deans of the College of L&amp;S twice a quarter if elected, Danielzadeh hopes to “encourage the addition of new majors that are more fit with our current job market and what our generation is actually interested in.” Danielzadeh didn’t specify exactly which majors she would like added. She also wants to improve Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.) by offering one-on-one affordable tutoring for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Campos, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a third-year sociology major, said the greatest issue facing students in the College of Letters &amp; Science is that the college does not have enough resources. Campos hopes to form a committee with honors students from different departments to “ensure that every student feels that their major concerns are being voiced.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Campos also wants to find a solution regarding textbook affordability by working with department heads and administrators on campus to gain funding to expand course reserves in the library.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chocron,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an undeclared second-year, also believes that awareness surrounding mental health is the biggest issue facing students in his college. Chocron mentioned his involvement in Hillel, the Public Safety Commission and the Interfraternity Council, citing his ability to work with a variety of groups at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the recent instances of antisemitism at UCSB, Chocron said that one solution is to hold “open spaces where leaders on our campus are able to educate students on the issue and let them form their own response and come up with their own ideas as to how they feel and what they should do.” He Chocron then emphasized that one of his biggest platform points is to ensure the safety of students and faculty at UCSB; he also said that UCSB needs to do a better job of making sure that students and faculty are aware of emergency policies.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Abdullahi said she would like to give financial aid to working students who live in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to try to see if I can work something out to get students who work above a certain amount of hours to get financial assistance,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also a proponent of strengthening the current bus services, as she finds that both freshmen living in the Santa Catalina Residence Halls and other students living in university-owned off-campus housing often have to “put in a little more effort to come to school on time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a huge inconvenience even when you live a mile away from campus,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also in favor of working with transfer senators, as she claims their constituents often overlap because many transfer students seek residence through university-owned off-campus housing as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve already been working with the current transfer senator that’s running… to do my job effectively, I will also have to be in close contact with people who are also representing the same groups of people that I’m representing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi said the biggest issue with university-owned off-campus housing is the distance from campus, stating that the extended time it takes to campus is an inconvenience to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking problems, an issue not necessarily specific to university-owned off-campus housing, was also a point of conversation during the forum. Abdullahi said she believes residents who live the farthest from campus should receive parking priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle rising student fees, Abdullahi suggested “looking into the system to see where money is allocated” in order to reallocate funds to help combat the price hike. However, Abdullahi admitted that she is unfamiliar with the system but plans to become more familiar with it in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of accessibility, specifically between the student body and A.S., Abdullahi would like to bridge the gap by personally approaching students to understand their needs. Furthermore, she would like to augment the current level of representation of university-owned off-campus housing students by moving events that would typically occur on campus to off campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing what students need and asking them personally is something that I intend to do,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi added that she would have no problem holding meetings with students living in university-owned off-campus housing to help inform them of A.S. resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing her background, Abdullahi noted that being a woman of color and a first generation student has allowed her to “walk through campus with a few different lenses,” which she believes will ultimately motivate her to be more “sympathetic” to the needs of students. As a Resident Assistant, Abdullahi said her immersion in different student communities has also helped broaden her horizons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you help everybody at the bottom, everybody else gets helped out as a result,” she said. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

He also noted that the general student body “isn’t necessarily up to par” on what the organization does and where student fees go, so he wants to change that and make sure students voices are “head at a state-wide and national level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has been working within the EVPSA office since her first year at UCSB – first as an EVPSA fellow, then as a community organizing director, and then as the legislative director – and now feels that she now has enough experience to run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as students are the future of the state, of this county, and we deserve to have a space in these vocations and be able to speak to what it is you need in order to be successful, what our students need in order to be successful.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any experience organizing UCSB students at the statewide level, such as lobby, or with UC wide-work? What have your experiences shown you about some of the issues facing students today? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has had a lot of experience lobbying for students, again referencing her past three years in the EVPSA office. She further noted that she is a member of Lobby Corps, and has been organizing student trips to the U.S. Senate, the legislator and Capitol Hill through this entire past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need to hear where they’re at because they are living in this bubble, this congressional bubble. I’m going to be able to pop that and say, ‘hey, we are your students. We are who elected you and you need to be able to listen to us and take our student concerns into value.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley referenced his work on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/summer-cal-grant-bill-reintroduced/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 3153</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a bill to extend the Cal Grant into summer sessions, stating that he and other students would “drive up to Sacramento at ungodly hours to testify at these hearings and train different students on what they’re testifying on behalf of UC.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve really seen the beauty and power that comes with organizing students. I absolutely love it and I appreciate every moment of getting to help students fight for the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Can you name some of the communities on the UCSB campus that you believe are the most marginalized? As the new EVPSA, how would you attempt to amplify these voices that you have mentioned and how do you ensure that students of all backgrounds are represented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said Black students are the most marginalized community at UCSB, making up 4% of the campus. He said Black students don’t get the same institutional support that other groups may have, and said that either he or someone on his staff would be in attendance at Black Student Union (BSU) board meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that while he cannot speak to the experiences of other marginalized students on campus, he would make sure to compose his office of people from different backgrounds as to increase representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to legislation… on the floor right now, to reaffirm the standards for deadly force for police officers and UCPD and California as a whole, we really need Black students to advocate on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she wants to listen to all voices on campus, and would take those concerns to the “state, to the federal government, to the Regents because [everyone’s] experiences matter.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EVPSA is a servant to its community. It’s time to take that to the next level and I’m ready to serve my students at any capacity.” </span></p>\n<p><b>In the past year, have you had any direct involvement with the EVPSA office, and whether you have or not, what would you change about the office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva repeated that fact that she has been in the office these past three years, noting the hardships that came with not having an EVPSA this past year. She added that her work as a Resident Assistant and as a UCSB tour guide gives her a “unique perspective” and further knowledge as to how to serve students best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also referenced the lack of an EVPSA during this past year, stating that “put students in a very hard position.” He added that the lack of someone in that position forced students into “non-institutional routes” to try and make change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he worked with 2017-2018 EVPSA Kristin Hsu during his first year, going on lobby trips and advocating for extending the Cal Grant. </span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks to the amazing work from UCSB’s voter registration volunteer coalition, UCSB has set national records on voter registration and voter turnout. How would you work with UCSB’s student-run voter registration coalition to increase voter turnout even further into 2020? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said it’s “absolutely incredible” that UCSB has one of the highest registered voters out of any campus in the nation. He said that while civic engagement is already very important to UCSB students, that would be expanded to work with more organizations on campus by tabling and registering people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know you might feel a little bit discouraged with the political climate right now, and it’s very easy to think that, ‘oh, national or any type of election doesn’t matter [because] our voices aren’t heard.’ But I’m here to say… that is not true. Each and every single voice counts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced the UC coordinator position within the office,  who “works tirelessly throughout the year to reinvigorate the [registration volunteer coalition program].” She added onto Beasley’s point by stating that she will expand that role, while also working to include the voices of students who don’t have the ability to vote. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you plan on getting students interested in attending EVPSA functions such as Regents meetings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said that accessibility has been an issue not just within the EVPSA office, but within A.S. overall. She said she would work to be as “transparent as possible.” She also noted that the office should table toward the beginning of the year in order to gauge issues that students care about, and then set up a system that would alert them when the office is doing work on an issue they care about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work that these students are doing is fueled by passion and grit and the will to serve, and we need to be able to highlight that and show students, ‘these are what your students are doing. This is why they care. This is how you can get involved.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his work as a Resident Assistant allowed him to see that marketing is the key to making sure students attend events. He said he wouldn’t let students know about events through “a robotic way, like through email.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Considering the budget restraints nationwide, what specific portion of the budget and Higher Education Act would you advocate for? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said specific numbers cannot be counted until it is known how much tax revenue California has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation as a whole needs to prioritize education, needs to put that at the forefront, because education builds the leaders for tomorrow… Education is a right and people need to be educated on the issues that they’re fighting for.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced California Governor Gavin Newsoms’ budget that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-newsom-allocates-400-million-to-uc-system-aiming-to-increase-student-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released earlier this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She noted that while his goal for the UC system to intake more students is “fabulous,” it is ultimately hard to accommodate more students because “we can barely accommodate the ones we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re talking about budget asks, what we’re advocating for, we need to be looking at things like basic needs. We need to be looking at things and making sure we’re funding our resources. We need to be looking at things like deferred maintenance – we have buildings falling apart, we have elevators that you wouldn’t dare step in because you value your life.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What would be the very first issue you will tackle if you are elected as EVPSA? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said the first thing she would tackle is financial aid expansion. She added that she wants to bring back the pell grant and wants to look into expanding the middle class scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without financial aid, I wouldn’t even be standing up here. You want to talk about subsidized housing, food stamps? That is me. Still will probably be me for a while, but it’s because of financial aid that I’m able to attend this university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said he wants to make sure that marginalized students’ voices are “uplifted and heard.” He said that, if elected, he would “bring these people that are often put at the bottom of the social hierarchy and make sure they’re brought to the top.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t have one person of color or one marginalized student there and expect them to advocate on behalf of everyone that’s not present. My first task in the office will be making sure that I have a diverse enough staff to be able to bring some of the issues [to me] that need to be talked about.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

A speaker has not yet been announced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second time in recent years that the union has called for a boycott of commencement speakers. During Spring Quarter 2018, United States Senator and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Congressman John Lewis withdrew from speaking at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego respectively after AFSCME called for a boycott amidst contract negotiations, the press release states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union and the university have been negotiating over contracts for over two years. The main disputes between the two are over pay raises, outsourcing and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union has gone on strike several times during this period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, UC Office of the President Director of Media Relations Claire Doan called the AFSCME’s demands “unreasonable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly triple those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. “We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the UC system, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-01/union-alleges-harassment-in-unfair-practice-charge-against-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alleging harassment and intimidation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during strikes over the past six months. The union subsequently went on strike following the filing of the charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University of California has used intimidation tactics to keep workers from protesting over outsourcing and income inequality instead of negotiating in good faith,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do not tolerate bullying.
