All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique to UCSB is the inclusion of herstories, a storytelling portion built on students’ experiences. According to Kyeremateng, UCSB may discontinue The Vagina Monologues  in coming years to focus solely on Herstories. Herstories involves first-hand prose written by students, creating an even stronger bond with the campus and community. The portion will be directed by Rachel Gregory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Kyeremateng’s key influences on the production has been the addition of diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The feminist movement is rising, and Herstories brings up a more diverse cast that The Vagina Monologues tend to not have,” Kyeremateng, who is a veteran of the production, said. “Looking back, the troupe was not as diverse as it could have been.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show stresses the importance of representation, she said, with this year’s cast including a bigender member for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While The Vagina Monologues alone are wonderfully informative, Kyeremateng said the name can exclude certain experiences; for example, someone who identifies as a woman may not be able to participate in childbirth, thus excluding LGBTQ+ identities. Kyeremateng is also performing her own prose piece this year on being an undocumented black woman in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophie Swezey, an actress working on the monologue “The Vagina Workshop” said her piece is about a middle-aged woman who goes to a “vagina workshop” to learn more about her vagina and how to make herself orgasm. She goes through a transformational experience</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finds her clitoris and ultimately learns how to make herself orgasm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We live in a society that tends to discourage women from exploring themselves, touching themselves, and talking about their vaginas,” she said in an email. “I think in essence that’s the most powerful part of The Vagina monologues — that women are talking about their experiences and discussing ‘taboo topics.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While never having had this woman’s exact experience, Swezey identifies with her character in terms of self-confidence and comfort with one’s body, issues many women face.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues intend to be a uniting and empowering show for women, but Kyeremateng said, “It’s not exclusive to just women; in order for the feminist movement to work, we need to get our allies involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who are uncomfortable attending an event where women openly discuss vaginas, actress Rose Houska said, “It’s okay to be uncomfortable. These are things we are not ‘supposed’ to talk about, so naturally it’s [going to] be uncomfortable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tickets can be found online <a href=\"https://events.ucsb.edu/org/os/wett\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, at the A.S.

Guest House, which began renovations in 2014, welcomed UCSB students and staff to its grand opening ceremony on Jan. 31. The $30 million project was financed primarily by a 30-year, $12.84 million loan.<em> Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, the original building needed renovation because of building damage and a lack of modern conveniences such as an elevator.</p>\n<p>The heating, plumbing and electrical systems had all been in place since the building’s construction in 1968 and were at risk of failure.</p>\n<p>In order to make The Club economically viable, the university added 30 guest rooms to the four remaining original rooms after two were torn down in the course of renovation.</p>\n<p>The total cost of the building was $20.6 million, $1 million of which was donated by Betty Elings Wells, a frequent donor to UCSB.</p>\n<p>The project took a year longer than expected because of unforeseen soil conditions, as well as discrepancies between the working drawings from the 1960s and the actual condition of the faculty club.</p>\n<p>The renovation was partially financed by a 30-year loan, which is standard for large buildings, according to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning. The loan totals $12.84 million and has a 3.78 percent interest rate.</p>\n<p>Haines estimates that the interest payments will come out to around $9 million, pushing the total cost of the project to about $30 million.</p>\n<p>The university expects revenue from The Club to pay for the cost of the building. According to Haines, UCSB will not use student tuition dollars to finance the building.</p>\n<p>According to Robert Kelley, UCSB historian, the original faculty club was completed in 1968 at the suggestion of Professor Steven Horvath.</p>\n<p>Horvath insisted that the building be a distinguished venue for visiting guests as well as faculty and community gatherings and that it be by the lagoon to capture a “serene ambiance.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the campus had explored the possibility of relocating The Club to a different location or repurposing the old building, but the university felt strongly that the location’s historical significance be preserved.</p>\n<p>The new building, which overlooks the lagoon, has 34 guest rooms, a bar and lounge, private meeting and conference areas and a terrace.</p>\n<p>Room rates start at $270 for non-members and $230 for members. In addition to paying off the loan, revenue from The Club will also support the staff and building upkeep.</p>\n<p>“The Club &amp; Guest House at UC Santa Barbara is designed to serve the temporary housing needs of University-affiliated guests and individuals conducting University business,” the building’s website says.</p>\n<p>In order to accommodate the limited space and high demand, guests who wish to stay at The Club must be attending a campus event or visit, be a club member, visiting faculty or conducting university business.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

She said the university hopes to end construction in June.</p>\n<p>Sue Hawkins, director of UCen Dining services, confirmed the project is ongoing, but said the university’s standard approval process has delayed the store’s opening.</p>\n<p>Hernandez also said the contracts between the university and Starbucks have required several drafts because “the campus is extremely careful in the execution of all contracts.” She added that the contract with Starbucks went through several iterations.</p>\n<p>Marc Fisher, associate vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, said an important part of the review was a comparison to similar contracts between Starbucks and at other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The process was extended longer than anticipated, but he also said the university is now ready to bid for construction.</p>\n<p>As for the new Starbucks’ appearance, Fisher said the store will be consistent with other locations.<br>\n“The design of our store is custom, but very much a Starbucks image and layout,” Fisher said in an email. “Starbucks, as you know, strives to provide a high quality product in an environment that is consistent with their brand.”</p>\n<p>As reported by the Nexus in May, the UCen is facing financial trouble and will look to the new Starbucks location to alleviate some of the building’s economic burden.</p>\n<p>In May of 2016, the Nexus <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the UCen had a year-end deficit of nearly $750,000.

She formed a tight circle of friends while she was at UCSB, infecting acquaintances with her positivity and open mindedness.</p>\n<p>“She was always smiling,” Rod Gomez, a fourth-year environmental science major who met Lim when they were second-year students, said.</p>\n<p>While juggling a full course load in the engineering department, Lim managed a job at Curvature, paid her own bills and was always open to adventure. At Curvature, coworkers were impressed by her work ethic, and Lim had plans to continue working in Santa Barbara after graduating in June.</p>\n<p>Lim loved melodic dubstep beats and electronic dance music, especially the producer Seven Lions. She tried her hand at DJing for fun, friends said, and she was an avid supporter of her friend’s musical pursuits.</p>\n<p>Raghav Thirumulu, Lim’s housemate and close friend, said she had an impressive talent for video games, beating her friends at games she had just picked up. She also entertained an obsession with several television shows, including “Westworld,” “Black Mirror” and “The Walking Dead.”</p>\n<p>“She just gave off this energy that made your day so much easier,” Ming Guo, who also lived with Lim, said.</p>\n<p>Evelyn Choi met Lim during her first year, and soon considered her a best friend and a sister. The first night they met in Anacapa Residence Hall, the two fell asleep while talking and studying in the lounge. A custodial worker woke them up several hours later, and “From then on, I knew she was going to be someone really important in my life,” Choi said.</p>\n<p>Over four years, Choi became accustomed to Lim’s quirks — including her keen interest in World War II. Lim had posters of “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” throughout her room, and she considered the era one of the rawest moments in human emotion.</p>\n<p>Lim was also given a few goofy nicknames: “Chrispitos,” named after crispy taquitos, and “Christinith,” referencing the movie “The Other Guys.”</p>\n<p>Landon Peik, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, met Lim for the first time at Hard Summer music festival. He remembers Choi leaning on Lim’s shoulder for the duration of a set by Porter Robinson, enjoying her friends’ company with their favorite music.</p>\n<p>College was a transformational time for Lim, her friends said, and she was always happy to go on hiking trips, to music festivals and spend time with people. She made her friends feel comfortable, while always challenging them with new ideas.</p>\n<p>Armando Muñoz, one of Lim’s housemates, described her as “one of the guys.”</p>\n<p>“You could talk to her about anything, at any time,” he said. “She was always down to listen and give advice. She could take it and dish it better than most guys.”</p>\n<p>Lim was extremely humble about her intelligence through years of hard work, friends said, and she never complained, even on her first 13-mile hike through the Sequoia Woods.</p>\n<p>Chris Tuch, a UCSB alumnus, met Lim as a resident assistant in Anacapa Residence Hall. The two were close, often staying up for hours watching Netflix shows, talking and playing Nintendo 64 games.<br>\n“She was a homie,” he said.</p>\n<p>The group of friends this week received an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends and students who crossed paths with Lim. Thirumulu created a donation page Monday in her honor which quickly exceeded the target goal of $5,000, raising over $8,139 in two days.</p>\n<p>Friends will hold a memorial in Lim’s honor this weekend, playing her favorite music to celebrate her life. Anyone who is interested in attending can contact Thirumulu at<em> rrthirumulu@gmail.com</em>. Lim’s family will also arrange a funeral ceremony later this month.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/","id":2433,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2432,2431,2430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The war has displaced over four million people, with as many as 450,000 between the ages of 18 and 22.</p>\n<p>The resolution was originally brought to the senators by Books Not Bombs, a campaign that encourages universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium. The same resolution has been proposed at other UC campuses and at the UC Student Association.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the fourth school in the UC system to petition the Regents to join the Consortium, following Davis, Irvine and Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Bianca Fernandez, off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major, said the university’s participation in the IIE Syria Consortium would show that UCSB is supportive of refugee students and their higher education.</p>\n<p>“Having the UC system give that opportunity and be that school that will help, indirectly, Syria rebuild itself [is] super important, and I think it’s a very progressive step for our school,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Syrian students’ financial aid will come from funding that is already reserved for international students, so U.S. students will not be affected by the resolution.</p>\n<p>However, Syrian students will receive priority admission to the university over other international students due to the severity of their country’s crisis.</p>\n<p>The resolution was drafted before President Trump’s immigration ban, which complicates the process of Syrian students getting to UCSB. The president’s executive order temporarily bans immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and proposes the indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees from entering the country.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she believes the resolution is still valuable despite Trump’s order because it demonstrates the university’s dedication to continuing the education of refugee students.</p>\n<p>“I still think it is super important that the UC system, especially UCSB, shows that we are accepting of Syrian refugees and we want to have a space for them on this campus,” she said. “We think it’s very important that students in Syria receive the higher education that they deserve.”</p>\n<p>The president’s immigration ban is currently being reviewed for constitutionality by federal judges. The executive order was temporarily blocked last Friday by a federal judge from Seattle.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said Syrian students’ presence at UCSB will provide “different viewpoints” on campus and make the campus “an even better place.”</p>\n<p>“They’ll make our campus more diverse and I think that’s something our campus is really proud of,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/","id":2434,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2433,2432,2431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"KCSB DJs Spin Music From Banned Countries","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Frankie-by-Jose-Arturo-Ochoa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Frankie-by-Jose-Arturo-Ochoa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Third-year KCSB DJs Frank Horne and Elena Bernick played music from the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by President Donald Trump’s travel ban on their radio show Tuesday.

While the two DJs often play music from foreign countries, this Tuesday’s show focused on Muslim rappers in particular.</p>\n<p>KCSB FM is the “perfect platform” for a show dedicated to resistance through the arts, Horne said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole ethos as a station is community radio representing sounds, music, opinions and values that you are not going to hear on commercial radio or in any other forms of media today,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Horne, hip-hop has been a symbol of dissent, revolution and change, as well as subverting what is expected from communities that have been brutalized by the dominant cultures.</p>\n<p>The two KCSB DJs chose music that tackles political unrest.</p>\n<p>The “Fire + Ice” hosts featured Libyan rapper Volcano’s single “Sawt Al Shaab,” and said his music video depicts the rapper singing in front of firing tanks while wearing golden chains and camouflage-patterned, oversized hoodies.</p>\n<p>Horne and Bernick, who goes by “DJ LenaBanga,” said “gangster imagery” is co-opted in the music video, modeled after the Western hip-hop scene.</p>\n<p>The DJs said the use of camouflage in the music video takes on a new meaning when placed in the context of a Middle East war zone.</p>\n<p>“The video, he shot it in a war zone in Benghazi. What’s really interesting going on in this video is a co-opting of gangster rap imagery. So, Volcano, he’s decked out in oversized hoodies, baggy camo pants, got the guns blaring, chain heavy,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>“The camo and the guns take on another meaning, but … we can apply that back to the origins of gangster rap here in the U.S. in the war zones that exist within our own cities,” he said.</p>\n<p>“He’s in a war zone, and these things are also very real,” Bernick said.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s radio show primarily played songs in foreign languages, such as Arabic and Farsi.</p>\n<p>The DJs chose Tuesday night’s artists because they have considerable followings in the countries they come from, though they recognize that certain regions lack large hip-hop fan bases.</p>\n<p>“Iran has a pretty large hip-hop scene compared to some places like Yemen or Libya,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>Bernick and Horne also said the artists’ skepticism toward government was similar to the duo’s own.</p>\n<p>“We think a healthy dose of criticism and skepticism towards the state is really, really necessary for us to keep going with a sense of freedom that resembles what we know it to be,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>DJ Frank Discussion and DJ LenaBanga’s show can be heard on KCSB FM 91.9, or streamed live on <em>live.kcsb.org</em>, on Tuesday nights from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/","id":2430,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2429,2428,2427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Travel Ban Bars 3 Students From U.S. Return","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/immigration1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/immigration1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States.

One of these students is an undergraduate from Syria, two are undergraduates from Iran and the remaining 37 are graduate students from Iran.</p>\n<p>According to Janet Afary, a professor of Iranian studies, there is “a great deal of anxiety” among graduate students at UCSB who cannot return to Iran in fear that their visas may not be renewed.</p>\n<p>Leila Zonouzi, an Iranian student pursuing a Ph.D. in global studies, planned to wed her fiance this summer. She said her parents and in-laws are in Iran, but since the executive order halted immigration from that country, they are unable to fly to the U.S. for the wedding.</p>\n<p>“I won’t be able to get married because, well, let’s face it, without our parents, who are we celebrating with?” she said.</p>\n<p>Zonouzi said the travel ban also affects visas for her fiancé’s job and her academic career. Her fiancé, who is also Iranian with a visa expiring in a year, may not apply for an H-1 visa or a green card “if this continues.” Zonouzi has a two-year visa expiring in June 2018 while enrolled in a five- to seven-year program.</p>\n<p>“With this rate of madness, I’m not actually sure I can extend it and be a Ph.D. candidate,” Zonouzi said.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB student affected by the travel ban is Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student who said he won’t be able to see his parents for years. His parents received their visas two weeks ago after applying at the U.S. embassy and undergoing a background check for nine months.</p>\n<p>“Because of the executive order, they can’t come to the United States because anyone from Iran is banned from entering the United States using any passport visa,” Golkaram said.</p>\n<p>The ban has also affected Golkaram’s job opportunities. He said he doesn’t know if he can apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) required for his internship placement this fall since the ban limits requests going through to the USCIS for Iranian people.</p>\n<p>“A lot of companies that I have job offers for right now are contacting me and asking if I know what my visa and resident situation is going to be,” he said. “Even if the companies are fine with me, they will be anxious about whether or not I can accept the job offer.”</p>\n<p>A Reddit user, posting as an Iranian-Canadian UCSB student on Saturday, said he or she was “sent back in Germany” while trying to reenter the U.S. after a trip to Tehran, Iran.</p>\n<p>The Nexus confirmed that Yousefian Jazi and Rasekh did not post on Reddit. The Nexus has sent the Reddit user a private message each day since Saturday, but the user has not yet replied.</p>\n<p>Kraig Rice, an immigration attorney with Juris Doctor California, said Iranian-Canadians would have been denied entry into the U.S on Friday and Saturday. The Trump administration announced Sunday that it would begin to allow entry to Canadian dual citizens.</p>\n<p>The order originally barred all permanent residents and all visas except foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas.</p>\n<p>United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began allowing entry to green card holders on Sunday. Those with student visas, however, are still prohibited from entering the country, according to Abbe Kingston, an immigration attorney based in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The craziness is there are already people who have been vetted, have already been interviewed, some on airplanes,” Kingston said. “That’s the hysteria it’s created. No one really thought this plan through.”</p>\n<p>In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States. OISS recommends that all international students avoid travel outside the U.S.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/","id":2427,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2426,2425,2424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Muslim Students Push Back Against Immigration Ban","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An executive order barring travel from six countries prompted over 200 people to protest at UC Santa Barbara Monday, echoing voices that spoke out nationally against the new presidency.

are.”</p>\n<p>Working with Queers Against Fascism, the Muslim Student Association and the Student Activist Network, she put together the protest in two days.</p>\n<p>Rallying the crowd at the

Aída Hurtado’s seat was between two women who used all of their frequent flier miles and took extraordinary measures to make it to the protest.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said her job as an academic was to be present that day, but “here was a plane full of individual citizens with no support or structures to ensure their participation in the March; they were simply answering the call of what they thought was right and moral.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the five-hour flight, Hurtado and the two women she met on board confided in each other about the political and social consequences women would face from the new presidential administration.</p>\n<p>Organizers of the march put together a panel of over 40 celebrities and activists including Angela Davis and Scarlett Johansson to speak against President Trump’s administration and his rhetoric toward women and marginalized communities. UC Santa Barbara professor Aída Hurtado was set to speak among those high profile speakers.</p>\n<p>As the department chair of Chicano and Chicana studies, Hurtado’s work has focused primarily on gender equality and Chicana feminism. For her, the Women’s March had a clear purpose: women are not going to give back their rights and they will not stand down.</p>\n<p>She was invited to speak at the march by organizer Carmen Perez, who studied under Hurtado in the early 2000s at UC Santa Cruz. Perez became her research assistant after taking Hurtado’s undergraduate course in Chicana feminism.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said feminism and criminal justice have molded most of Perez’s career. Perez is the executive director of the nonprofit Gathering for Justice, founded by Harry Belafonte.</p>\n<p>In the midst of so many high status speeches and the 470,000 people that were marching, Hurtado did not think there would be time for her to speak. She thought that if unscheduled guests like Madonna had not gone up to speak at that point, then she wouldn’t either.</p>\n<p>The program was running behind so she decided to put away her typed speech and enjoy the moment. Taking in the grandeur of that day was important to her, she said. She was watching her former student navigate a historic movement.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Perez texted Hurtado and told her not to leave the stage because she was going up after Madonna.</p>\n<p>Her original speech was going to be about the incredible “feminist victories” throughout history: obtaining the right to vote, abortion and contraceptive rights and sexual harassment legislation were just some of the topics that Hurtado was going to mention. She found it necessary to highlight women’s “efficacy and resilience.”</p>\n<p>But, when she approached the podium, she chose not to give that speech. Instead she spoke on Perez’s accomplishments. Hurtado said, if it were not for public education, which is under potential threat by the new presidential administration, Perez would not be here today to organize the momentous demonstration.</p>\n<p>Hurtado expressed the significance the UC system has in the world as a public institution. “We are one of the biggest public university systems in the world,” she said, “and there is a risk that it could be privatized.”</p>\n<p>Hurtado was referring to President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, Elizabeth “Betsy” DeVos. DeVos has a history of being tied to the privatization of education. According to The Atlantic, DeVos’s family poured $1.45 million into preventing Michigan from adding oversight for charter schools.</p>\n<p>The racial divide in the country was also a concern to Hurtado. To her, it is homogenizing to say that white women were the only ones at the march when the participants were diverse in age, gender and race.</p>\n<p>According to Hurtado, the media was expecting a strategic formula to what the march itself achieved. But she doesn’t believe social change is that simple. It isn’t effective to expect a simple equation to define how social change works, she said.</p>\n<p>Hurtado wants the focus on the fact that individual citizens showed up and said “not in my name; you are not going to do this to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Al Jazeera’s Trump Tracker, within the first five days of Trump’s presidency he has already passed a bill with the support of the House to stop federal funding for abortion and block tax credits for individuals and businesses buying abortion coverage under federal health care law. The anti-abortion bill was originally enacted during the Reagan administration and has since been revived by every Republican president after him and subsequently dismantled by every Democratic president.</p>\n<p>The “dismantling” that the administration is doing instead of “building” is her main concern. She said she doesn’t think we should have a “list” of demands just yet when there are so many executive orders being made to take away more of citizens’ rights.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen, but what did happen was magical,” she said. “I want to sit on that for a while.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily

Marine Science Institute and the World Economic Forum partnering to bring marine health science to the international stage.</p>\n<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an international organization that focuses on global issues such as water, clean energy and global health. This year, the organization is encouraging political and business global leaders to connect with scientists and brainstorm how to improve ocean health.</p>\n<p>The Marine Science Institute (MSI) was selected to provide a scientific component to the global dialogue about ocean health. The Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program within MSI, will work directly with the WEF to present an ocean health plan at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June.</p>\n<p>“With a campus surrounded by the ocean on three sides, the health of our marine environments is something that is very personal for UCSB,” Pierre Wiltzius, the Susan &amp; Bruce Worster dean of science and executive dean of the College of Letters and Science, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We also have a reputation as one of the leading institutions for marine research, and we are very proud to continue to foster an interdisciplinary environment that encourages collaboration around vital issues like ocean health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative and an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, said the WEF is hoping to increase ocean research and health. He said UCSB will be their “guide from the science community.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about whales anymore,” McCauley said, emphasizing the ocean’s modern role in economic, social and political issues.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius emphasized the importance of a dialogue between scientists and global leaders to preserve the marine environments for the future and said he believes the MSI’s leading research will help the “crusade to save our oceans.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that this will elevate the conversation about ocean health to a global level, which is crucial, because oceans affect the entire planet on a global scale,” Wiltzius said in an email. “We need the support of world leaders as we translate our marine science research into action.”</p>\n<p>McCauley recently went to the WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he presented marine life extinction rates and the importance of improving the state of the ocean. According to McCauley, the WEF was receptive to his information and he is “optimistic” about the ocean’s future.</p>\n<p>“It’s really exciting to see a room full of people that really care and want to learn,” he said. “I think in the science community, people have done a really good job translating what is happening in the oceans into currencies that help global leaders understand that it matters.”</p>\n<p>The ocean’s economic value is $24 trillion, making its wellbeing more than an environmental issue — it’s a global commodity. Additionally, overfishing is a crucial problem affecting the oceans and can have current and future impacts on nutrition and food insecurity, as well as increase international conflicts over fish.</p>\n<p>McCauley said the MSI and WEF will focus their efforts on decreasing overfishing, particularly in the harvesting of tuna fish, and present their plan to the United Nations Ocean Conference this summer.</p>\n<p>“Historically, we thought that oceans couldn’t be overfished … but we figured out we were wrong,” McCauley said. “About one-third of all our global fish docks are overfished.”</p>\n<p>The plan will include combining transparency with sustainability, as well as offering ways to make sustainability more affordable. Some retailers are unwilling to change their consumer habits toward an environmental approach because of the expense of sustainable fishing.</p>\n<p>However, McCauley said many retailers are already joining the environmental effort and he hopes more will join the dialogue by the June meeting in New York.</p>\n<p>The WEF and the United Nations Oceans Conference will be making large steps in their address of global environmental concerns. McCauley expressed worry about the Trump administration’s quiet stance on ocean health, but he said the MSI and WEF’s partnership will allow for global leaders and scientists to address the environment as something more than a national topic.</p>\n<p>“The nice thing about the ocean is that [it] is truly a global commodity, and the future can be decided as an international conversation,” McCauley said.</p>\n<p>McCauley said he is hopeful the MSI and WEF partnership will be able to begin dedicated work for global oceans and make a lasting difference for future generations.</p>\n<p>“We view it as a legacy thing. I have kids, and I have to learn how to pass the ocean in a slightly better state to [them],” he said. “In many ways, this is a great time because everyone in the international community is realizing we need to work together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/","id":2714,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2713,2712,2711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Capps Donates 20 Years of Documents to Library","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capps-Featured-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capps-Featured-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lois Capps, former congresswoman for the United States who retired in November, has donated 20 years’ worth of documents to the UC Santa Barbara Library’s Special Research Collections.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lois Capps, former congresswoman for the United States who retired in November, has donated 20 years’ worth of documents to the UC Santa Barbara Library’s Special Research Collections.</p>\n<p>Curated from Capps’ long history in Santa Barbara, the documents will be located on the third floor of the UCSB Library’s Mountain Side.</p>\n<p>“I never entertained any other library as a possibility,” Capps said in an interview with the Nexus on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The collection includes letters from Capps’ constituents and several awards selected by Danelle Moon, the head of the Special Research Collections. Moon reached out to Capps and began collaborating on the records transfer last fall. The remaining awards will be digitally represented within the collection.</p>\n<p>In a statement released Tuesday, Capps said one of her easier decisions was to donate her official papers to UCSB, while her decision to retire was “a hard one.” “This fantastic school has played such an important part in my family’s life,” she stated.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Library is honored to preserve and manage former Congresswoman Lois Capps’ papers, which will support generations of students and scholars interested in her 20 years of leadership and service,” UCSB Librarian Denise Stephens said in a press release.<br>\n“We are deeply grateful to Lois Capps for this gift, which will help advance UCSB Library as a destination for research on California history and politics,” the release read.</p>\n<p>Capps, who said she believes “pretty strongly that we have an open and transparent government,” is glad that the collection can be used and “not just stored away in musty boxes somewhere.” Capps redacted personal information to ensure that individuals’ privacy would not be violated.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the material is really very paper oriented, before 2002, before everything went totally digital, so there’s a lot of interesting scrapbooks about her time in office, you know, her calendars, all of the legislation she was involved with,” Moon said on Wednesday “This is kind of an eclectic representation.”</p>\n<p>Capps donated around 130 boxes worth of material, which Moon estimates will take about six months to categorize.</p>\n<p>UCSB librarians will survey the collection to determine its contents, formats and special preservation requirements. They will then arrange and describe the collection for public access.</p>\n<p>“Some things will need special preservation depending how old it is,” Beaudry Allen, who will be processing the collection, said.</p>\n<p>Once librarians process the collection, students will be allowed to use the documents for research. They must request the documents in advance from the Department of Special Research Collections and view them in a specific room where no food, drinks or backpacks are allowed. Students also are not allowed to use pen or take any flash photography because of the nature of the documents, some of which are irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>Moon also hopes to raise funds to offset processing costs. The department receives around $100,000 per year just for the materials needed to preserve collections. This doesn’t include wages or other costs.</p>\n<p>The collection will become part of the growing number of political papers at UCSB, which also include records from former assemblymember Das Williams, former California legislator John Vasconcellos and Ronald Reagan’s biographer Lou Cannon.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>During the public forum, the Regents received several remarks on the tuition increase, which will be voted on during Thursday morning’s meeting. Commenters also critiqued some of the logistical problems with the UC’s intended expansion, as the UC intends to enroll an additional 10,000 students over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Susan Willats, an employee at UC Santa Cruz for 30 years, said the University’s increased student population has caused practical issues for the school, as the amount of students it admitted increased in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Because there was neither time nor funding to create a corresponding increase in infrastructure, we have far exceeded our resources,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several double rooms have been converted into triples, she said, and the residential lounges have been eliminated to provide more bed space, leaving students with not enough spaces to study.</p>\n<p>“This over-enrollment has not only added to the unsustainable workload of faculty and staff, but it has absolutely diminished the quality of the educational experience that the university provides,” Willats said.</p>\n<p>While concerns over growth were prevalent at the public forum, many also chose to focus on the upcoming vote on Thursday to increase tuition. President of the Council of UC Faculty Associations (CUCFA) and UCSF Professor Stanton Glantz was among several who spoke out against the decision.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that it costs money to run this place and the only real two places to get it is from the taxpayers or from the students and their families,” he said. “It’s very disappointing that you are going to be continuing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s failed policy of privatization which has generated over $12 billion in student debt since 2000.”</p>\n<p>Glantz also mentioned a report endorsed by faculty, students and staff organizations from all across UC, CSU and the community colleges that shows “the effect of the privatization and the fact that this could be fixed.” He held up the report at the public forum and encouraged that Regents use it to reform the current tuition system.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students as well as faculty spoke at the forum. One UC Riverside undergraduate student criticized the tuition hike, saying the UC system takes pride in its “pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality” but is “sorely deficient” on all three. She said students’ wages could not be expected to cover rising costs.</p>\n<p>“If we place the burden of the cost of education on students who aren’t able to make above minimum wage on a part-time income to supplement the tuition costs that are already increasing, how do we reasonably expect any of them to be able to afford the increasing costs that you are trying to implement now?” she said.</p>\n<p>Alex Lee, the president of Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD), also asked the Regents to reject the proposed hike.</p>\n<p>“We as UC students are constantly the ones being harmed and taxed … I ask you, the Regents, to seek alternative sources of funding as well as maximize the money we currently have by cutting unnecessary expenses at the campus level and prioritize the educational experience,” Lee said. “On behalf of UC Davis and UC students, I ask you not to raise tuition.”</p>\n<p>In reference to tomorrow’s tuition vote, Monica Lozano, the chair of the board, said she looks forward to tomorrow’s discussion in action.</p>\n<p>The Regents plan to vote on the contentious issue of tuition hikes on Thursday morning after another session of public comment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/","id":2425,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2424,2423,2422],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate plans to pass a resolution next Wednesday to allocate university spots and academic scholarships to the Syrian refugees displaced from their home universities.</p>\n<p>Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll authored the resolution and presented it at the meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 18. The resolution is part of a UC-wide movement to join the Institute for International Education (IIE) Syrian Consortium for Higher Education in Crisis.</p>\n<p>So far, participating universities have collected 17,635 signatures in support of scholarships for Syrian students.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syrian Consortium is a group of international universities that have allocated admission space for Syrian students and provided them with scholarships to help them attend school while their own country remains unsafe in an ongoing war.</p>\n<p>Funded by the Clinton Foundation, the United Nations and other global organizations, the goal of the scholarship program is to help Syrian students continue their education and rebuild their country.</p>\n<p>The program also offers scholarships, leadership training and conducts research on how to improve global higher education.</p>\n<p>When refugees are forced to escape their country, the students must temporarily abandon their education. The IIC Syrian Consortium plans for these Syrian students to attend college in other countries and then return home to become leaders.</p>\n<p>If the resolution passes, UCSB would be the fourth school in the UC system to officially petition the Regents to join the IIE Syrian Consortium, alongside UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Berkeley. Of the three, UC Davis is the only school that has already enrolled Syrian refugee students.</p>\n<p>The resolution was brought to the Senate’s attention by “Books Not Bombs,” a campaign founded in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The goal of “Books Not Bombs” is to encourage universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, 90,000 to 110,000 Syrian students qualify for university admission “based on pre-war enrollment estimates.”</p>\n<p>American citizens would not be affected if the resolution were adopted because the student positions and financial aid would exclusively come from funding reserved for international students.</p>\n<p>Syrian students would get priority admission over other international students because of their country’s need for education.</p>\n<p>If the resolution is passed at UCSB, the UC and the program may face political backlash from conservative groups across the nation.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nameh, a third-year history of public policy and global studies double major, said he believes the Syrian students’ efforts to attend American universities could be thwarted by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“I’m very worried about that,” Nameh said. “They might start passing executive action that could curtail immigration completely.”</p>\n<p>The refugees are arriving in the United States through regular means of immigration, so their entry could be threatened by President Trump’s executive order, which was drafted Wednesday, to temporarily block refugees from entering the United States and suspend visas of those from Syria and six other Middle Eastern countries.</p>\n<p>“These refugees would be coming through standard immigration paths, so if these paths get shut down, then there’s no way for them to get here,” Nameh said. “Then we’re going to have to address a much bigger issue.”</p>\n<p>The resolution is currently in the A.S. External Committee, which will discuss it further in a meeting Friday. If it passes through the committee, it will be considered and voted on at the A.S. Senate meeting on Feb. 1.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Participating universities have

Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries. He sees the solar cooker as a means of separating pollutants from water.</p>\n<p>There is still much more work ahead for Orisun. The team wants to build a final model that is “hiking worthy,” according to Kalluri.</p>\n<p>“Just because we pitched something at a local event doesn’t mean it’s finalized,” he said.</p>\n<p>Sato said they need to secure manufacturing for the product and talk to potential partners, an opportunity that has been opened up from the networking done at Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>For teammate Evan Blasband, a second-year electrical engineering major, winning first place at Startup Weekend is “like a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>“You always hear stories about people starting a business when they’re in college,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to do this stuff for like 10 or 15 years now.”</p>\n<p>Salazar likens the art of origami to our relationship with our environment. The various parts of an origami bird — the beak and the wings — are interdependent and proportionate to one another, and any one small change to any of these features affects all others.</p>\n<p>“What I’d like my origami work to show is that, despite all of this interdependence, you can still create remarkable things, even with something as simple as a sheet of paper,” he said. “Imagine what we could create with our physical world if we follow these principles of interdependence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Srikanth Kalluri is a third-year student, not a second-year. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/","id":2717,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2716,2715,2714],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":45,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
