Food Security Committee, said the Free SB campaign set its sights specifically on the cultivation tax because of its “reliability”; due to the recency of legalized marijuana, Moon said, the tax is unlikely to go anywhere for some time, which the campaign flagged as a good marker for consistent funds.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultivation tax first arrived in California in January 2018, when the state deemed that “harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax … [and] applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/l519.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA.)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, according to the CDTFA, is set at $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of marijuana flower and $2.75 per dry-weight of marijuana leaves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is also a popular product among local growers — over “a third of all cultivation licenses issued in California to date are held in Santa Barbara County,” according to a </span><a href=\"https://sd19.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-24-jackson-issues-statement-cannabis-trailer-bill-vote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the </span><a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/local/santa-barbara-county-cannabis-tax-revenues-yet-to-materialize/article_13df5cb0-6165-506a-aee4-6787a650a187.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Maria Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Barbara County could earn between $4 and $64 million in tax revenue per year. According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This is especially concerning in the university environment, which is supposed to be a place of open, unimpeded exchange of ideas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tanner has been with the university since Fall Quarter 2013, according to student verification records. She earned a masters in feminist studies at UCSB in 2015 and has since served as a teaching assistant for several courses within the department. </span></p>\n<p>According to Tanner’s <a href=\"http://www.lauratanner.net/about/\">website</a>, her doctoral research is focused around “the mistaken idea that biological sex is socially constructed or possible to change” and “the abusive and dangerously experimental practices of medically “transing” children and young adults.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university could not discuss specific incidents because of confidentiality requirements but said that UCSB will review any reports of campus policy violations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to comment on any potential complaints against Tanner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of some tweets visible on Tanner’s account, posted between January and June: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 20: “People who think they are transgender exist. No debate. There is no such thing as actually being transgender (a male woman or a female man). Believing so is a delusion. I will not validate such a decision by validating terms like ‘trans people’ Interpret that as you will.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 5: “Yea, like ‘woman’ ‘female,’ ‘man’ &amp; ‘male?’ These words all have original definitions based on reality. Transsexualism started this mess by trying to change ‘man/woman’ to include people of the opposite sex &amp; fantaszing that drugs &amp; cutting change one’s sex in the first place.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 29: “Rather than resolving dysphoria or dysmorphia, ‘transition’ maintains &amp; reinforces a state of opposition to one’s own body and forces one to live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance. This is not mental health care. #StopTransingKids #TruthisNotAHateCrime” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling males women, or females men is the very definition of misgendering </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel deeply disrespected by the notion that any male can call themselves a woman and be considered the same gender as me. #MalePrivilge #TransWomenAreMen #TruthIsNotAHateCrime”  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “If you ever had a dick you aren’t a lesbian, not now, not ever.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 26: “Genital cutting of any kind does not change one’s sex and can never make a man into a woman.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 14: “Trans ‘women’ are men, ffs”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2: “Stand up for your son because he is perfect the way he was born – a boy. No child is trans. It’s not possible to be born in the wrong body.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feb. 4: “People who believe themselves to be trans exist. Transgenderism itself is a delusion. A man cannot become a woman anymore than a male can become female. This is NOT a denial of the humanity of people who believe the delusion, it IS reality</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript

to her tweets, students have called Tanner “absolute trash,” a “dumb bitch” and “a gatekeeper of womanhood.” One student tweeted “that bitch needs to die.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other responses on Twitter called for Tanner to lose her job, arguing that Tanner’s beliefs interfered with her ability to teach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the nearly 400 UCSB alumni echoed some of the rhetoric seen on Twitter, demanding that the university take steps to protect transgender and genderqueer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instructors should not promote material in the classroom and department that denies the reality of trans people’s experiences or reifies gendered and sexed binaries as essential or real,” the authors emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues are not merely an academic debate; when the academy legitimates transphobia, it lends credence to an ideological position that systematically disenfranchises and kills trans people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the graduate students also spoke out in support of “trans, non-binary and sex working students at UC Santa Barbara,” stating that “in our classrooms, curricula, and professional interactions, we are committed to supporting trans and sex working students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As part of Feminist Studies, we are committed to cultivating intersectional, student-centered learning and community environments. To the students who have been harmed by transphobia and anti-sex worker rhetoric in our department, we are so sorry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither letter mentions Tanner directly, both letters were released shortly after Tanner faced backlash on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two second-year UCSB students, Kyremina Youssef and Ari Moini, saw Tanner’s posts on Twitter and decided to organize the June 13 demonstration to make the greater student body aware of Tanner’s social media posts. The demonstration echoed the themes of the two open letters: that those who hold transphobic beliefs should not be allowed to teach at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moini said she believes it is “unsafe for the trans community on campus” for Tanner to teach at the school, and Youssef added that the two would hold additional rallies if Tanner continued teaching in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that while she knows Tanner is “protected by her First Amendment on Twitter,” the students are “also showing our First Amendment [rights] on campus by advocating for our community here and spreading awareness.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The Coalition, and Chikukwa, have been fighting for the funding for nearly two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding is separate from the Cal Grant, although it is based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the funding allocation is a win for the CBUC, it does come with an asterisk; if there is not sufficient projected revenue in the California General Fund during the 2021-22 fiscal year and the 2022-23 fiscal year, the combined $10 million in funding will be suspended on Dec. 31, 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a suspension happens, the California Legislature intends to “consider alternative solutions to restore this program,” Senate Bill 106, the bill written to implement this portion of the budget, reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UC Santa Barbara said in a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ucsbfinaid/status/1144756479125159937\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is waiting on more information from the state and the UC Office of the President (UCOP) before releasing an official statement on when the money will be distributed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email, Saúl Quiroz, director of UCSB’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, said that students will receive the standard message they get any time there is a change to their financial aid. However, he said the office will also likely be reaching out to the specific students who will receive this additional funding; students who qualify can use the additional aid beginning this Summer Session A. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they have a balance, it will first be applied toward that balance. If the funding is enough to cover their balance, or if the student does not have a balance, students will receive the remaining credit in the form of a financial aid refund,” he also clarified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will be disbursed in the same way other financial awards are distributed — through a student’s BARC account — Quiroz added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office is still waiting on “official guidance from the UC Office of the President regarding awarding practices on individual campuses” and more information about how much of the $4 million will be allocated for UCSB, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The allocations for this summer will be tied to historical Cal Grant allocations, and we hope to learn what UCSB’s share will be soon,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiroz also expressed excitement about the funding and gratitude toward CBUC for the organization’s work over the past two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without their extraordinary effort, this additional funding would have not been made available to our students,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that this funding is the first step toward ensuring that Summer Cal Grants will become a reality in the next year or two.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional summer financial aid allocation is not the same as the Summer Cal Grant Bill, Amy Rose, policy analyst at the California Budget and Policy Center — a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Sacramento — emphasized. Rose focuses on studying higher education issues and has “closely followed and researched” various financial aid proposals, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose was the one to clarify to the CBUC that the funding was not technically a Summer Cal Grant Bill, but instead provides summer financial aid to the UC and CSU and is given to students based on Cal Grant eligibility.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), whereas the budget’s “summer financial aid” funding flows directly to the UC and CSU,” she said in an email. “In addition, Cal Grants are available to students at California Community Colleges and the private institutions, whereas the budget’s funding is restricted to students at UC and CSU.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, students could use their Cal Grant aid during the summer, although there is a cap on a student’s lifetime eligibility that may leave them ineligible for that aid in the future, Rose said. The new summer aid means students won’t have to draw from their Cal Grant to cover the costs of summer classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget allocation differs in that it provides money directly to the UC and CSU to distribute but is still based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa explained. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power.

They got to see a lot of our successes, also.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa noted that most of the members of CBUC are underclassmen or are entering their junior years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daevionne Beasley, incoming director of internal affairs for CBUC and Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, said the work the Coalition did would not have been possible without the support of individual students and various student groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done,” he said in a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa also attributed CBUC’s success to “all the students who either signed a petition, called, lobbied, retweeted, shared” or engaged with their social media in any way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That, I believe, was the tipping point.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Converting the restrooms, located by the Associated Students offices and the Graduate Student Association Lounge, only requires changing the signage on the door. Gary Lawrence, director of the University Center (UCen), said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen Governance Board worked with Dwayne Mosbey, program coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), to learn more about the process of converting the bathrooms and the potential costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey was invited to speak at a UCen Governance Board meeting in May as a representative of the Trans Task Force, which has been advocating for more all-gender restrooms on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My purpose in going [to the meeting] was telling them what the steps have been with [the RCSGD] in the conversion of multi-stall restrooms, especially because there is no written policy within the UC code about how that is to be implemented, and we just recently finished the conversions for the Social Sciences and Media Studies building,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1732\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal Restroom Access Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, approved by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, requires all single-stall restrooms in a “business establishment, place of public accommodation, or state or local government agency” in California to be marked as all-gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the bill does not address multi-stall restroom conversions, Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey, along with RCSGD Director Craig Leets and UCSB Policy Coordinator Jennifer Lofthus, has been working on an outline for a UCSB multi-stall bathroom conversion process to facilitate more conversions in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also addressed the board’s concerns about renovations to add more stalls, which he said weren’t necessary to have the restrooms converted. The total cost of converting the restrooms is about $300 to $350, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs associated with single-stall restroom conversions are typically covered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services, but Mosbey said the office did not want to cover the costs for multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board is still considering renovations to the restrooms, Mosbey cautioned against renovations, noting that they take much longer than signage changes and could create animosity toward people who identify as transgender or nonbinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey is sitting on a special advisory committee over the summer to discuss what renovations would be necessary, if any. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD has been directing its efforts on bathroom conversion projects throughout this past year, with a focus on converting multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey’s first step was to update the </span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AGRmap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-Gender Restroom Map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which details the locations of all-gender restrooms on campus. He is also working with the Department of Geography to signify all-gender restrooms on the new interactive campus map the department is working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s next priorities are identifying all the single-stall restrooms on campus that still need to be converted and working with different departments on campus to convert multi-stall restrooms in their buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said that department heads and vice chancellor hold the power to approve these bathroom conversions. The multi-stall bathroom conversion in the Social Sciences and Media Studies building was the first multi-stall conversion the center helped facilitate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to get an all-gender restroom in every building on campus. But a realistic timeline of that, it could take up to years, depending on how many kinds of barriers we run into, whether departments actually end up agreeing to doing it,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Community Services District (I.V.

Sir said she has spoken to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez about the app and plans to work on its implementation throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to focus on bringing A.S. out of the dark ages and making sure that entities, all the resources, are [available] in one app,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also plans to secure a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop, a project which former President Brooke Kopel began in the 2018-19 school year. At the end of her term, Kopel presented several possible permanent locations to the 69th Senate. Sir has met with Kopel regarding the bike shop and plans to implement Kopel’s vision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside her other projects, Sir’s primary focus for the year is what she calls Strategic Vision 2025, a five-year outline of specific goals for UCSB that would improve future A.S. administrations Her plan expands upon one </span><a href=\"https://plan.as.ucsb.edu/files/2014/11/StrategicPlanMay2014.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created by former A.S. President Jonathan Abboud</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to audit [A.S.],” Sir explained. “[I want to see] what people think of A.S. now, find the missing gaps and bridge it, and then create the Strategic Vision 2025 to show, ‘I want A.S. to look like this [in 2025].’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir plans to survey students, asking each, “What do students need right now compared to five years ago?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For her office, Sir said she has filled the position of chief of staff with former Off-Campus Senator Adam Chohan of the 69th Senate. She noted that she wants to fill her office “with a diverse array of students” and will spend the summer filling the rest of the presidential office staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t really want to rush and [I want] to make sure that everyone knows my office is open.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is realistic about the time constraints of a one-year term, noting that she has spoken to previous presidents about the limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After hearing Brooke and previous presidents, they said, ‘You have so many duties and you can probably only accomplish one.

I’m not looking really for people who have experience in A.S., because I didn’t even have any coming in,” he said. “One of my interview questions is, ‘What is your perception of A.S., and how would you like to alter that?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley’s priorities going forward are ensuring that summer conferences are organized in a timely manner, which especially helps with saving costs, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conferences are over, he plans to start laying the groundwork for his office’s work in the fall so they can hit the ground running. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing I’m really, really wanting to focus on is supporting incarcerated people now and people who were formerly incarcerated, so I’ll be working really hard with my federal policy analyst and statewide policy analyst to see just what is the UC’s role in private prisons,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley wants to ensure that his office has its timeline sketched out early on in the year so it can get as much done as possible, noting that a yearlong term isn’t very long at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his outreach both to students and student organizations already on campus, as well as to incoming first years, Beasley plans to prioritize in-person presentations. With his previous experience in advertising the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first version</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Summer Cal Grant Bill and working in the Office of Admissions, he said talking to people directly offers them the chance to ask questions and be engaged as opposed to just seeing ads on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley does plan to utilize social media for his office, as well, and wants to use it to both advertise lobbying trips to students and keep them updated on work the office is doing through digestible graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m just very, very excited to do this work,” he said. “People were always telling me before I got sworn in, like, ‘Oh, just make sure you do this and this little thing is important’ and this and that, and now I’m actually here, able to do it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“First order of business is to clean this damn office,” Beasley joked. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<p id=\"“3”\">\n</p><h2 id=\"#3\">3.

The board aims to help community members develop a relationship with law enforcement officers to address safety concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who frequents public markets and likes to “sell vintage or secondhand clothes,”  Ornelas said he also plans to create art-centered markets in I.V. The markets would be community spaces where residents could sell and showcase their art, beauty products and other handmade items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ornelas, the current climate for local markets consists of “a bunch of folks who are really passionate about [art] and kind of just make a Facebook group and have to shell out their own money to sell it at these [markets].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to create the infrastructure for a space where folks can go showcase and sell their art,” Ornelas told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “My vision for that is kind of like a bimonthly or monthly farmer’s market type of thing funded by A.S.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from his desire to create a new local market, Ornelas’ work as an off-campus senator led him to spearhead the development of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/a-s-senate-creates-committee-to-address-mold-in-i-v-residences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mold committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, which surveyed I.V. residents to gain a better understanding of the number of residences with mold infestations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For my last class survey, which garnered about 45 responses, it was really alarming to see that 43 out of 45 people are affected by [mold].

Our main function is to help students navigate school policy when they’re being charged with breaking it. Our service is only possible if [students] deliberately come to our office on their own and ask us for our help,” he said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediate plans for the OSA include moving the physical office space from the A.S. Main building on campus to the second floor of the Pardall Center in Isla Vista, a project initiated by previous S.A.G. Grecia Martinez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By sharing the same floor as the Legal Resource Center (LRC) in the Pardall Center, Nguyen said students can more easily access the resources of both offices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Student cases often deal with both on-campus policies and off-campus laws. If the OSA is in the same space as the LRC, students can conveniently work with both of our offices, who have two different jurisdictions, without having to go from one place to another,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen also plans to work with the Office of Student Life (OSL) to restart the polling analyst project left behind by the 2017-18 S.A.G.

remained unfilled after Spring Quarter elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the beginning of her term, Adam was also responsible for the appointment of Off-Campus Senator Tianna White as first Pro-Tempore and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman as second Pro-Tempore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the immediate goal of fulfilling the empty Senate positions, Adam said her focus will be on training senators in the beginning of the fall quarter as opposed to winter quarter, which is when Adam herself was trained when she was a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators [from the 69th Senate] weren’t provided with any sort of training, whether it was on the association, microaggressions — literally any training until the middle of winter quarter… our first half of [the 69th] Senate was just whether or not you had an in with Steven [Ho, former IVP], and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” Adam said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t come in magically knowing anything once you’re elected.

months after more than ten universities across the United States, including UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley, became embroiled in </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-college-admissions-scale-elite-schools-20190312-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accusations of using unfair backdoor methods to admit

2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for allegedly helping students gain acceptance by fabricating transcripts for student-athletes who had never played the sports listed on their transcripts competitively, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Bruin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported. Salcedo pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, the father of a Berkeley alumunus was charged with </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/13/father-of-uc-berkeley-alumnus-charged-in-college-admission-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allegedly paying a test-taker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take his son’s SAT test to help him gain admission to the university, as reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Cal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The father pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were no reported instances of backdoor admissions at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June’s audit is the first of two system-wide ECAS investigations into the UC admissions process; the second will be completed by the end of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit report made note of three specific suggestions to strengthen the UC application process: clearer documentation, improved verification protocols and stronger admissions procedures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure clear documentation, the audit suggests maintaining a “clear documentation trail” in order for admissions personnel to arrive at accurate admission decisions. The audit also calls for additional documentation for students applying on the basis of athletics or “special talent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the audit calls for a surveillance of donations and philanthropy to avoid admissions decisions “being made on the basis of expected financial gain to the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an applicant’s truthfulness, the audit suggests the UC bolster its current vetting techniques to make it more difficult for third parties to frame an applicant’s “special talents” to gain an upper hand in the admissions process. Furthermore, the audit noted a lack of accountability in monitoring a student athlete’s engagement in their respective sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of strengthening procedures, the audit reported a lack of processes in place to manage conflicts of interest in the admissions process and the “reporting structure” of athletics compliance offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit suggests an improvement of these processes to “prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/current-issues/admissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that while the UC believes its UC admissions process “works well and has significant and effective controls in place,” the UC “accept[s] all of the ECAS recommendations so we can continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take our zero tolerance policy extremely seriously — even one instance of admissions fraud is one too many,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano also implored each UC chancellor to develop their own “campus-specific” plans and tailor them to the ECAS’ recommendations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a specific plan for the UCSB campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of May, the California State Assembly took initial legislative steps towards improving university admissions processes with </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1383\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 1383</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would deny any university within the UC system the power to grant students special admittance, or “admission by exception,” unless the admittance is approved by three college administrators. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me. I say “home” because it truly has become a place where students can find mentors who are like older siblings, staff who care like parents, and friends who understand your at-home life better than anyone else you could find at UCSB,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It started out as a baby program with a handful of students and is now a campus entity with [its] own organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen called the Promise Scholars Program “one of the best things” that has ever happened to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were brought into college and left to fend for themselves. But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side. They reached out, and helped me get my life together,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program didn’t just throw money at us and say “here, graduate.” They provided us with skills for the future, and people we can always go back to for help. The Promise Scholars Program helps students like me have a fighting chance in college, and be successful afterwards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen compared the feeling of being part of the first graduating class to the feeling of being the first in one’s family to graduate from college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of pride in being the first group to graduate, because–although this sounds dramatic–I feel like we paved the way for future Promise Scholars.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

We’ll see if we can increase that number, ‘cause I think there’s a lot that people have to contribute that are not typically in these types of conversations and don’t typically apply to these types of positions,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re better if we can engage that and make it more competitive next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil attributes this same reasoning to the high concentration of UCLA or UC Berkeley students as student regents in previous years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Certain jobs, certain spaces, kind of self-select for certain types of students, and I think that that’s fair to consider. The other side of that is, we got 10 campuses of the UC, and a lot of them are very different,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a lot of different majors, lot of different career trajectories, lots of different aspirations, and these different perspectives that come from the campus space and the discipline space are valid. I like that I’m at UCSB. I like that I get to represent a UCSB frame.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil’s goal in prioritizing students who are not traditionally represented comes from his belief that the system always benefits when a diverse array of voices are heard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does it benefit students who transfer from community colleges to receive mentoring and guidance, but universities also benefit from their knowledge, drive and character, he emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we should always be mindful of if we’re kind of having a lopsided kind of pool from any specific category, whether that’s from a couple different schools, a couple different disciplines, we should be aware of that, and see if we can intervene in some ways and make sure that we’re getting the broadest benefit from the student base that we have available.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of those responses can be seen below:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ángel A. Valdenegro:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June 2017, the city of Philadelphia raised its rainbow flag high for its first annual Pride Kickoff. The pride flag fluttered in the Philadelphia air, championing the experiences of millions of TLGBQ+*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> members across the world. It harkened to the activism that got us here and to the activism to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the difference that this flag had as it marched through the streets of Philadelphia and through the many streets after that are the two stripes that adorned it on top. One black and one brown—an innocuous reminder that queerness is woven into more colors than just one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being here at UCSB has proven to me that I am those stripes. Let me explain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college experience has pushed and pulled, expanded and contracted, championed and sequestered the many identities that constitute me. In some contexts, my brownness is celebrated. My native tongue expresses itself freely and without harassment. I can wear rainbow buttons happily and without danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in other contexts, as a lot of us have come to realize, we have to push aside who we are for an identity that is more immediate and palatable. We have to relegate our life experiences to just business or to whatever the sign on the door says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point, many of us have felt the sting from the relegation I’m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re struggling to make ends meet that week, you probably don’t want to tell your professor. Why make it about you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re doing science, you’re not a woman; you’re a scientist. Why does it have to be about gender?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re an academic, you’re not a person of color; you’re an academic. Why do you have to make it about race?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re a non-traditional student, you’re just a student. Why are you different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this kind of thinking is dangerous when we ignore the disparities and disadvantages that might exist in our settings. It is impossible to support one another if we do not understand the situations we exist in. I can’t save you from drowning if I refuse to acknowledge you’re underwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, being a person of color fighting behind the rainbow flag used to mean leaving our brownness at the door with the umbrellas. It meant fighting for a movement that never really promised to help those in the intersection of being a person of color and queer. (And don’t even get me started on how much more we need to advocate for trans people.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the wisdom that our queer brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings in Philadelphia reminded us of that June is the diverse nature of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That one descriptor does not fit all. We are not just gay. We are not just queer. Those words are just adjectives among a multiplicity of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this Pride, go celebrate the diverse nature of being queer — heck, even the diverse nature of just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being human</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And even if you’re not queer, I invite you to turn to the person next to you and appreciate them for the depth of who they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go fight for each other. Celebrate one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did that on purpose</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ángel A. Valdenegro is a graduating queer Latino physics major who wants you to google Kayden Clarke, Tamika Washington and Chynal Lindsey.</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>Being Invisibly Queer: by Kylie George</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who have been by my side throughout every one of my phases in college (*cough cough Nexites cough cough*), y’all know all about my various dick-scapades: From the Night of Three to fucking a random dude I met at a bus stop, my thirst for peen is never quenched.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly the craziest thing I’ve ever done to date, however, is willingly enter into a healthy, committed relationship for the last year and some change. Shocker: This person has a penis. Therefore, my relationship will appear heterosexual to the average stranger for (hopefully) the rest of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this staunch dedication to cock has caused some problems for me throughout my time at UCSB, if not from external sources then from my own internal thought processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I constantly questioned — and sometimes still question — my validity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community because before sophomore year of college, I had never acted on any of my feelings toward various women in my life to whom I felt attracted. I felt like the only way for me to prove to both myself and others that my bisexuality was a valid self-descriptor was by experiencing reciprocal sex with a woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t even completely out until my sophomore year of college and, even still, I haven’t directly told my mom yet (if you’re reading this, Mom, hey hello hi, I’m bi!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my entire first year of college, I thought that people in my dorm hall would be made uncomfortable with the fact that I’m attracted to girls, so I kept my identity on the down low. It didn’t help that I was ultra-paranoid about the way people perceived me and if they liked me or not because of my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I say this literally </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crippling anxiety. I was also affected by the perceived lack of a queer community on campus, so I thought being out would not be accepted by the majority of UCSB students or faculty, thus further encouraging me to beat down a large part of who I was and still am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not until I joined a sorority (Tri Delta, R.I.P.) did I feel comfortable openly sharing my deep attraction to that güd pu$$. Sure, it helped that over the summer I saw a psychiatrist and got put on a pretty high dose of Prozac to help with my anxiety, but I truly feel that I began publicly identifying as queer because of the amazing queer women I met in Tri Delta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m fully aware of how sratty this next sentence is going to sound, but hear me out: My Big really inspired me to embrace a large facet of my identity by sharing her own story and her various struggles that come with being gay. From bringing me down from a panic attack brought on by being pretty publicly sexually assaulted to opening my eyes to the awesome (and very present) LGBTQ+ community on campus, I owe this woman a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey to self-acceptance did not conclude at the beginning of sophomore year, though. I mean, what am I? Fucking Molly Ringwald in “The Breakfast Club”???? Good guess, but not quite. I still have to exist after the happily-ever-after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incidentally, though, I ended up sleeping with a woman for the first time shortly after this life-changing epiphany, and it left me with a bag filled with mixed feelings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took her home from a frat party (wearing a huge sweatshirt, pajama bottoms and fuzzy socks with my Birks, no less), and the deed was done. The only problem was that afterward, I didn’t feel like I proved anything to anybody by doing it. The encounter felt just as empty as the billionth dick I sucked dry the week prior, and I ended up feeling like I had an even feebler claim to membership in the queer community than I did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since that night, I have not slept with another woman, and at this point I may never get to. Don’t get me wrong; my current partner is more than I could ever ask for in a lifelong companion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’m still worried about how others perceive the image I put out into the world, which is dumb and I should stop that right now, but emotions don’t work that way. I want it to be apparent that I’m queer and not just lying about it to get attention, but I’m struggling with finding a way other than tattooing “QUEER” on my forehead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend was talking to me the other day about being bisexual in college, and she expressed a lot of frustration for the girls who identify as “bi-curious” because they give “real” bisexual women a bad image. I couldn’t help but think about the ease with which I could be grouped in with the former group, and I felt so invalidated. I’m not saying the friend was talking about me or even that I agree with their statement (which I very much don’t), but I realized in that moment that I still don’t feel deserving of the label “queer” or “bisexual.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m learning to embrace my identity and stand up when people comment on my “invisible queerness” brought on by my love for my heterosexual male partner, but I still have a long way to go to where I really feel like I can appropriately consider myself queer.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/","id":3259,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3258,3257,3256],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Spotlight Shines on Different Stages: Campus Groups Host Alternative Graduations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/graduation-caps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/graduation-caps.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The majority of the alternative graduation ceremonies will be held in the next two weeks.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6,867 undergraduate and graduate UC Santa Barbara students will walk across the graduation stage in just over a week, receiving recognition for years of work both in the classroom and outside it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But many of those will also attend alternative graduations — special ceremonies aimed at celebrating the triumphs and successes of minority or underrepresented groups on campus.

So for [transfer students] to even be in this position [to graduate], especially people of color, it’s so monumental. It really takes a lot for us to get here and to even graduate from a four-year institution,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think a lot of us expect [to graduate].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for Hernandez, and for the numerous transfer students graduating with the class of 2019, the Transfer Student Graduation is an “acknowledge[ment] that we did beat the statistics and that we are here. You achieved this. You deserve it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second year the Transfer Student Graduation has been held. Last year, the Transfer Student Graduation welcomed around 50 students; this year’s will see over 120, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Transfer Student Graduation Committee is mainly led by fourth-years Neyra Patricio, Katherin Jordan, Sophie Weimer and Hernandez; the committee began planning for graduation during Winter Quarter, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s budget to hold the entire graduation was $200. This year’s is $2,000, an improvement Hernandez attributes to the Transfer Student Alliance’s transformation from an organization to an Associated Students Boards, Commission and Units (BCU). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hernandez and Patricio, having a transfer student graduation is incredibly important in a number of ways, but particularly because of the unique and shared experiences that transfer students go through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because [the ceremony is] different. Most transfer students only have transfer friends, at least the people that I know, so getting to have a graduation ceremony with people that you know [is good], especially because a lot of transfers value it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all really nervous for it to get here, but we also want it to get here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, who was also involved in the planning of the Transfer Student Graduation during its first year, echoed Patricio’s sentiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that being on Senate with the 69th Senate and working on the Transfer Student Alliance allowed him to see students “get rewarded for all the hard work they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing it last year, how it impacted and how it meant so much to many students… There’s literally people crying [at the ceremony] and it was very emotional and very intense, but it was good,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Hernandez and Patricio hope the tradition of a transfer student graduation ceremony continues after they both leave UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we built the tradition and it keeps on going,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s ceremony will be held on June 14 in Bren Courtyard at 5 p.m. There will also be a reception at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lavender Graduation and Pride Awards:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lavender Graduation — a graduation ceremony dedicated toward UCSB students who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community — has been running for 19 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony, alongside the Pride Awards, has served as an “integral part” of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), according to UCSB alumnus ‘18 and RCSGD Programming Coordinator Dwayne Mosbey, who helped plan this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Lavender Graduation] began to create a space for queer and trans students, especially when they were entering spaces they didn’t necessarily feel comfortable in or within an insitution they didn’t feel was serving them,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning of this year’s ceremony was a “collaborative effort” between Mosbey, RCSGD Director Craig Leets and Associative Director Quinn Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey explained that in previous years, the Pride Awards used to be separate; this year, they were “rolled together” because both are “made to recognize queer and trans students’ resilience and academic achievement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thought it’d be great for those two to be coupled together,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation ceremony itself is modeled similarly to the typical UCSB graduation, Mosbey said. The ceremony will see graduates “walk” into the Student Resource Building forum, following a welcome ceremony with a number of speakers, which typically includes the vice chancellor, a keynote speaker and a student speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said there are typically 30 to 35 people who partake in the ceremony; this year saw an uptick, rounding out to 45 students. Last year, Mosbey himself was one of the people who walked in the Lavender Graduation ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows the chance for queer and trans students to be recognized outside of the larger ceremony, and [anyone] can come to the Lavender Graduation. [They can express] their most gender expression and gender identity and feel comfortable with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can wear whatever they want and can also decorate their gowns and caps — “This is all about making sure [queer and trans students] feel comfortable and that they feel recognized.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All graduates who go through the Lavender Graduation ceremony are awarded purple cords, while folks who work at the RCSGD and people who win awards receive rainbow tassels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of awards also varies, depending on the number of nominations. This year, 13 awards will be handed out, according to Mosbey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey hopes students who go through the ceremony will take away one key thing: “We’re allowing that space for them to feel supported, [so they] know that throughout their college career, the queer and trans community was here for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that we will continue to be here for them even after they graduate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Lavender Graduation will happen on June 9 between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Student Resource Building forum. </span></p>\n<p><b>Black Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Bolden, a fourth-year biopsychology major and the undergraduate speaker for this year’s Black Graduation, said he almost turned down the opportunity to speak at this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was kind of hesitant, just because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do have pretty good experience with public speaking, but I didn’t feel like I wanted to add that [burden] on for myself,” he said. “But then [the offer] gave me a little bit of moment of clarity, because I got a chance to look back and see how far I’ve really come.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of realized that it was a little bit humbling,” Bolden added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden is one of the 55 Black undergraduate and graduate students who will be participating in this year’s Black Graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 15 at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Stallworth, co-chair of the organizing committee and second-year sociology and Black studies double major, said it’s important for Black students to have a space where they can come together and celebrate their achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The educational system wasn’t really built for people of color in general, but for Black students, we really had to fight for us to have our identity be present on campus,” Stallworth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony is a way for Black students to do just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth said the ceremony will have a mix of student speakers as well as spoken word, musical performances and slideshows of the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Jeffrey Stewart, from UCSB’s Department of Black Studies, and Professor R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy from New York University’s Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities, are the two faculty speakers. Meridith Merchant, a psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services, is the closing speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth believes the speakers’ words will leave an impression on the graduating students and is looking forward to hearing from them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The speech is] sending a message and it’s setting the tone for someone’s life,” he said. “I think it’s just really important to have speakers that really motivate and empower students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth is also happy to see the graduates — many of whom have helped him in his two years at UCSB — step off the stage and onto a new chapter after college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I’m] also just excited to see all the Black grads and be able to celebrate them because I think it’s amazing how they’ve been really mentors for me throughout my time here at UCSB. I get to see them go off, and I get to follow in their footsteps.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden echoed Stallworth’s words, naming several other students who will be graduating alongside him  as inspirations over the past few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking about the achievements of the Black community at UCSB over the past few years, Bolden said he wants to highlight the growth of individual students like Zenzile Riddick and Kuvimbanashe “Eddie” Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class of Black grads is phenomenal. One of my hallmates, she’s going to freakin’ Harvard, that’s amazing, Zenzile. Since first year, I knew she was going to be amazing,” Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said he’s proud to have seen everyone’s growth over the past four years and where they’re all headed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m proud to be part of the 5% that has come through here. I definitely recognize that a lot of people don’t have such a positive outlook of UCSB like I have, not everyone’s been blessed with the great experience that I’ve had here,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[But] after coming here, I think that my pride in being a Black man has done nothing but grown exponentially, because I feel like I’m representing my own people here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special part of the ceremony for Bolden is the fact that a large portion of the Black graduates participating in the ceremony lived together in the Black Scholars Hall in Santa Rosa during their first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be around each other and enjoy each other’s presence and see each other’s faces and see us finish through,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At typical graduation ceremonies, it’s easy for Black students to feel like less of a community, Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing us spread so thin isn’t the same, isn’t nearly as powerful for us being together, having our own space, our own ceremony, our own opportunity to recognize one another.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said his speech at the Black Graduation ceremony will be one of the first times his family will see him in an academic setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now this is an opportunity for me to show [my mom] what I’ve been doing this whole time.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Chicanx/Latinx Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chicanx/Latinx Graduation ceremony is just as much about the community behind students as it is about the graduating students themselves, two of the organizers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesenia Cardenas, a fifth-year chemistry major, and Jessica Arenas, a fourth-year global studies major, agreed their favorite part of the ceremony is when the students walk into Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are asked to bring two people to walk them in as live mariachi music plays in the background and photographers snap photos of them, the two said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students, they feel like they get their degree for family too, so it’s nice that you can walk up there, it’s almost like they’re walking up there with you,” Cardenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas sit on an 11-member organizing committee that begins its work one full year before graduation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s cabinet, which organized the 45th Chicanx/Latinx Graduation being held on Saturday, June 15, 2019 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., was dedicated to giving more voice to graduating students throughout the whole process, Cardenas and Arenas both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year we’ve been focusing a lot on being inclusive of Central American identities because that’s a prominent issue, the erasure of Central Americans,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Arenas said it can be hard to actually feel that they are supported or represented on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a first-generation student, it’s hard to navigate higher education, and sometimes you don’t see people that look like you, in your classroom settings or even in your living settings sometimes,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like most students enjoy the Chicanx/Latinx Graduation because it celebrates their identity and also their cultural background. They aren’t represented in classrooms, but they do feel represented in the graduation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to infusing the ceremony with various cultural elements, the committee works to ensure that the ceremony caters to family members who attend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ceremony, held in Harder Stadium, will have over 500 students walking the stage. A lot of those students are first-generation and have parents who don’t speak English, Cardenas said, so they will have a translator present so their parents can follow along as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my personal experience, my parents don’t really know what I do here, they just know that I go to school and I’m studying,” Arenas laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas said that while friends and family back home might not understand what they’re studying, they’re still very proud of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d rather them understand the ceremony than just sitting there and see all these names called out. At least with [Chicanx/Latinx Graduation] there’s performances and Spanish,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><b>Undocumented Student Services:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monarch butterfly, adorning a pin which many undocumented graduating students will be wearing as they walk the stage, is a symbol of migration, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator Diana Valdivia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To wear this pin is to recognize the impact migration has had in your life experiences.

The pins are meant to recognize both undocumented students and others who participate in the services’ programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its year-end ceremony, the service recognizes different student leaders for their work and advocacy in the undocumented student community on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Valdivia said they had approximately 30 students graduating, compared to around 25 last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s good to know for [undocumented students] that they’re graduating, that they’re not the only one that is graduating that has been through this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the service also handed out separate pins for students to give to their loved ones and supporters, one of which reads “Proud Immigrant Dad of a Graduating Senior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We recognize that students get pins, get stoles and then we also know that it took a community effort to have folks graduate,” Valdivia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Valdivia said they hope to find a way to recognize students who may not be undocumented themselves but have family members or loved ones who are. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But I have friends struggling for rent, struggling for tuition. I can’t imagine an added fee,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led her to create the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison was initially going to stake out by Henley Gate alone, but then she decided to post on Facebook about her idea to get more photographers for the event. Once she had heard back from a handful of people, she set up a group chat for everyone to schedule themselves for shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niko Van Eimeren, one of the photographers at the event, said she signed up to help because she personally understood the struggle graduating students face when paying for end-of-the-year expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fourth-year environmental studies major, Van Eimeren said she herself wasn’t sure if she was going to get her graduation photos taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] a lot of my friends, I took their photos for them at a discounted rate ‘cause I know that it can be really expensive,” Van Eimeren said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alejandra Gularte, one of the students who attended the event to have her photos taken, said she appreciated the event’s impact on both graduating students and photographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found it was a way to help smaller photographers that maybe wanted to get practice. But also, for me, it’s cheaper, because I pay a lot of money for school,” Gularte said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison gives all the credit for the event to the photographers who signed up to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was only possible because people were volunteering their time to do their photos,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Photography isn’t always something you’d think would be something you could do to help people,” Morrison said.  “Anyone can really do something like this, stuff like this means a lot to people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that as a graduating student, it can be difficult to see all of your friends posting their photos and not be able to afford them yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a good grad photo to give to their mom — it’s like a small thing in your day, but honestly would make someone’s day,” she said. “If you can, take time out of your personal life to do a nice thing once in a while.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year art major Reannah Viray took inspiration from that idea and put her own twist on it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88921\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88921\" data-attachment-id=\"88921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/pay-what-you-can-photography-event-inspires-other-students-to-give-back/pay-what-you-can_sanya-kamidi_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1246&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1246\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pay What You Can_Sanya Kamidi_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88921 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray hosted her own pay-what-you-can event for graduating seniors on Wednesday in the Arbor, offering her art services to anyone who wanted their cap decorated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a photographer in high school, so I wish that I could have participated, but I didn’t know how to until it was over, so I was like, ‘what other way can I spare my time to people who don’t have the resources or the income necessarily to get grad caps done?’” Viray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s nice to be able to offer something that could be seen as a luxury to people that can’t afford it.

transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will join the current regent designate, UC San Diego doctoral student Hayley Weddle, in serving on the Regents board if he is approved at the July meeting. He will serve alongside Weddle when she succeeds the current student regent, UC Los Angeles doctoral student Devon Graves, for this upcoming year; following Weddle’s term, Muwwakkil will take over and serve as the voting regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is comprised of</span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 26 appointed and ex-officio members </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that govern the UC system. The UC student regent is a full-voting regent of the University of California and the only voting member on the board who is required to be a student at one of the UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only real differences [between student regents and other appointed regents] is that they are closer to the student population, both in age and geographic proximity. The idea is that they might be able to leverage the student voice and kind of contextualize the policy decisions that are being made,” Muwwakkil said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will spend the first year of his two-year term learning the ropes of the position before transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first year, you’re participating in all of the committee meetings and going to all of the talks, but you’re not voting — you’re functionally shadowing the student regent who’s appointed in their second year of the position,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A record 113 UC students applied for the position of the 2020-21 student regent, </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-student-regent-nominated-2019-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared to 40 who applied in the cycle before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
