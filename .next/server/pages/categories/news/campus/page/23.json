Students can stop by the pop-ups, which will be located at several points on campus such as the Student Resource Building, MultiCultural Center (MCC) and University Center, to pick up a book from the selection, Solomon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The narratives that we wanted to share was the one of… not the typical narrative that makes people feel comfortable but rather educated about actual experiences of Black people,” they  said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pop-ups are expected to show up on campus by the beginning of March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The books include </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parable of the Sower </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Octavia E.

Although many students might not have time for leisure reading or book clubs, Solomon hopes students will see the value in reading these books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope that people can simultaneously take some time from their busy schedules to read these books and get really in-depth information from each other in the groups and from the books themselves,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the process of selecting books, Solomon and Jackson enlisted the expertise of AnneMarie Mingo, an Ella Baker visiting professor of Black Studies at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mingo, who previously met Jackson through her involvement in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MCC and the African diasporic Cultural Resource Center, was happy to see a project with this goal in mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was exciting to me that students would have an opportunity to receive free books written by powerful Black authors,” Mingo said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Jackson and Mingo met, the two discussed the project and which books could accomplish Solomon’s and Jackson’s goals. Mingo provided suggestions for specific books and advised Jackson to consider a variety of genres and perspectives and to find books for the pop-up that represent each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I drew from books on my personal bookshelf, books I would want my students to read but we do not have space for them on the syllabus, books that are great introductions to nontraditional fields, books that can easily make must-read lists, and more,” Mingo said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Solomon and Amingo hope this year’s pop-up will be the beginning of a project that will resurface on campus in following years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope this will be the start of an annual opportunity for students to select books that they may not be familiar with, join in dialogue with others who also  select the same books, and extend their education beyond the classroom,” Mingo said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Solomon, the idea behind the pop-up goes back to one of the fundamental underpinnings of the university: the value of diversity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole purpose of being at a university this large and the whole purpose of diversity… [is that] people to learn something that might not have to do with their own understanding of life and like experience.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Director Jeanne Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Merchant, the demands played an integral role in her decision to work at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was inspired by the agency and activism of students to ask for what they need and to use their voices and resources to get their needs met.  I would not have left LA … if it had not been for the opportunity to respond to the call of Black students who were feeling unsupported, underrepresented, and invisible,” Merchant said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant, who grew up in Los Angeles but spent “15 summers in a row in Chicago where my parents were born,” said her parents moved to California to provide her with more opportunities than they believed she would have in Chicago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They instilled pride in being Black, demanded that I speak up for myself, and regularly told me that I could do anything that I put my mind to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a psychologist was a natural choice for Merchant, who said she has always been the person that friends confided in and looked to for advice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I chose to go to graduate school with the thought, ‘Everyone tells me their deepest darkest secrets and talks to be about anything, why not get paid to be me?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant’s areas of focus are women’s health, academic success, overall student wellness and “empowering and supporting students who may feel marginalized and specifically students from the African Diaspora,” according to the C.A.P.S. website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have always worked in settings in which I advocated for underrepresented populations and helped give voice to the voiceless,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant cited her own personal experiences as the reason she cares so much about helping others find solutions to their problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My personal reproductive trauma, having a daughter (Nailah Asha) that died the day before her first birthday in 2006, led to me learning the statistic that Black college educated women are twice as likely to have an infant die than a white woman who drops of out high school,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My loss and this data, fueled my passion for being part of the solution that reduces levels of stress of people who look like me (and anyone else I come in contact with) because too many babies and mothers are dying unnecessarily due to the structural and institutional racism across the life span, lived and passed on through generations, and it needs to stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant hopes to help Black students find peace and a sense of belonging and safety through counseling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At predominantly white serving institutions, more often than not, many students of color, and especially Black students find themselves fighting against being treated as inferior and as if they don’t belong before they even step into a classroom,” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students of color, particularly Black students, may not feel as comfortable asking for help as others for a variety of reasons, Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s a lack of trust in institutions, but there are also cultural stigmas for students of color who might be shamed for talking about their family’s private business or who worry about being called crazy, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is much easier to seek help if one feels as if someone understands their struggle and reduces the burden that students have felt to teach the counselor about the struggle to be Black at a white serving institution before they can get the help they need.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her time so far at UCSB, Merchant’s proudest accomplishment is establishing for Black students that she is there to support them and that she truly sees them. Since her and Barfield’s time at UCSB, Black students have utilized C.A.P.S. in larger numbers, Merchant said, and lately the program has been working to reach out to students more as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as she works to support Black students on campus, Merchant faces her own struggle on a predominantly white campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been lonely and overwhelming as the only Black female psychologist in CAPS,” she said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a Black staff member at UCSB mirrors the Black student experience in many ways and having community is essential and important for me too” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BSU Demands Team recently released a set of demands in early February, addressing the need for more Black student advocacy on campus, both institutionally and one-on-one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant believes the completion of these demands, particularly the construction of a building named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development,” would increase Black student retention and graduation in a significant way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that it would be very supportive, empowering, and meaningful for Black students to have a place that they can call their own, where they feel a sense of belonging, and are encouraged, in word and action, to be their best selves.  Where they are guaranteed to see people who look like them and to trust that their needs are important and their existence is validated,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a freestanding building for Black students was one written into the first demands released in 1968. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need to take more responsibility for our role in improving the mental health of all students.  This is not just the responsibility of psychologists in the counseling center but it is everyone’s responsibility,” Merchant wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, with respect to Black students who I believe make up the second smallest ethnic group on campus, greater efforts need to be made to create, sustain, and enrich the experiences and environment for Black students,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are people working independently on initiatives to improve Black student admission, retention and graduation rates, Merchant believes that centralizing those operations is key to being accessible to Black students who need help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also believes that while Student Affairs has prioritized diversity, inclusion and equity, individual professors and academic departments need to be held accountable for creating classrooms where Black students are not made to feel out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many Black students and other students of marginalized populations enter classrooms on the defense due to how they are treated by classmates as well as professors,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many professors are not held accountable for their complicit behavior and students suffer.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:12 a.m.]:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Merchant’s first name is Meridith, not Meredith.

id=\"caption-attachment-86546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simons and Delency created the podcast in 2015. Courtesy<em> of Blake Simons and Delency Parham</em></p></div>\n<p>The two Bay Area natives released the first episode of the “Hella Black Podcast” in 2015 with the goal of amplifying Black voices and covering topics that are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>“With each episode we hope to educate and inform our listeners on all things related to Blackness. Our podcast is important because it uplifts the voices of Black radical organizers who are doing the work in the field. Often times our narratives are not told,” the two wrote on their <a href=\"https://www.hellablackpod.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>Coming to UCSB as a podcast host is a welcome change for both Simons and Parham.</p>\n<p>Simons attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and Parham attended Santa Barbara City College before transferring to the University of Idaho. Both played sports at their respective universities.</p>\n<p>“I think about my experience as a student-athlete at SBCC, and it was hard enough getting folks on my own campus to take me serious. I experienced students at the UC thinking they were better than me and other students at the city college. So to come back here, and have students gathered in a room to listen to Blake and I host a live podcast…never something that would [have] crossed my mind,” Parham said in an email.</p>\n<p>The two only recently began doing live shows for the “Hella Black Podcast” in September 2018.</p>\n<p>“As the podcast started gaining more traction, we thought it would be dope to be able to engage with people and create a radical space in person to have the conversations we have. We’ve had shows in Oakland, Los Angeles, where over 100 people pulled up to each show,” Simons said in the email.</p>\n<p>While the two both have a background in writing, they realized that podcasting would allow them to reach a larger audience.</p>\n<p>“Folks might not have time to read a full article due to the constraints that capitalism puts on people, but you can listen to the podcast on your way to work or when you’re doing laundry,” Simons added.</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, financial director for the Black Student Union at UCSB, worked with A.S. Program Board Cultural &amp; Arts Coordinator Kiyomi Morrison to pull the event together.</p>\n<p>Gessesse wanted to bring the two to campus because of their experiences being Black on predominantly white campuses, and especially because of Simons’ work co-founding the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s BSU is currently trying to develop an agreement for UCSB to build a freestanding building where Black students can get access to resources and have a space for themselves.</p>\n<p>“Blake himself has pioneered a lot of what we are trying to achieve for here at our own campus, but having been a Cal alum, a UC product and having worked within the UC system for several years since he’s graduated, I felt like he could share insight to what it’s like being black within the UC,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>As an “avid listener of the podcast” herself, Gessesse believes the two tackle topics that are typically stigmatized. Some of the podcast episodes dive into sex work, the intersection of Blackness and queerness and exploitation of Black student athletes.</p>\n<p>“I want to take the time to acknowledge all the queer/trans folks, and Black women that have put in numerous hours of labor to help me develop healthier perspectives and radical politics. Blake and I like to use our platform as an opportunity to uplift their voices,” Parham said.</p>\n<p>“We both know in a patriarchal society, men’s voices will be the voices that are projected. We want to use our privilege to center the most disrespected and threatened, and be in solidarity with them.”</p>\n<p>Parham and Simons also cite their Bay Area roots and their familial connection to members of the Black Panther Party as the inspiration for their discussions.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest draws of the podcast is that the two also work as community organizers and educators, having their boots on the ground in addition to speaking on the subject.</p>\n<p>“Teaching is one way I build community and help educate Black people on the conditions of our people,” Simons said. “As community organizers we both create programs that center the most vulnerable Black people under this white supremacist capitalist state.”</p>\n<p>The two cofounded the People’s Breakfast Oakland, which provides houseless people with hot foods, clothing and hygiene products.</p>\n<p>Gessesse hopes that students attending the event come away with ideas about how to keep the needs of Black students in the fold even after Black History Month is over.</p>\n<p>“I really anticipate that not only does this talk, this conversation, does not stop at the end of February when Black History Month is over, but that we continue to make these strides in our community about coming together,” she said.</p>\n<p>At the same time, she hopes the show on Friday night can be a place where Black students come to unwind and be in a space tailor-made for them.</p>\n<p>“Being Black is political, yes, but not everything that Black people do has to be political.”</p>\n<p>Simons and Parham will be hosting their live show on Friday, March 1, at the Loma Pelona Center at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this story said that Simons alone hosts the People’s Breakfast Oakland. Simons and Parham co-founded it together.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-86522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several administrations spoke at the town hall, including VP for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn (right). <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), an extension of the Associated Students (A.S.) Human Rights Board, <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">revised its list of Asks</a> on Feb. 4 to include mandatory training for Office of Student Life organizations and sports teams, a revised Title IX Office website and online access to Gaucho FYI content, among other requests.</p>\n<p>Monday’s town hall was the second of the year, following the first <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-26/sasa-hosts-town-hall-focuses-on-interpersonal-violence-prevention/\">town hall</a> that was held at the Pardall Center in November.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez led the meeting alongside SASA Vice Director Alya Ruiz and SASA Policy Analysts Vince Feliciano and Alia Reynolds.</p>\n<p>Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez began by providing an update on the Department of Education’s <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">Proposed Title IX Amendments</a>. The department is still in the process of reviewing comments, which means that the status of the amendments is still unclear, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>The most concerning potential regulations include changes to the evidence threshold, scope of jurisdiction and responsible employee designation, according to Alvarez. Additional amendments include the right to cross-examination of survivors and perpetrators and a narrowing of the definition of sexual assault under Title IX.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Briana Conway said to students that despite the potential stress the proposed changes could bring survivors, C.A.R.E. will work to support them through the legal process however it can.</p>\n<p>Reynolds pointed to <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB493\">Senate Bill 493</a>, a piece of legislation recently introduced by Senator Hannah Beth Hannah-Beth Jackson, which aims to combat potential issues arising from the amendments.</p>\n<p>Reynolds questioned whether the UCSB administration would be taking a stance on the legislation. The UC system <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">released a response</a> to the proposed amendments in December 2018, stating that the changes would “reverse decades of well-established, hard-won progress toward equity.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez responded that they are aware of the bill and are currently trying to navigate its position.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock discussed the possibility of requiring Standard of Excellence Training for OSL organizations and sports teams, which is another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>The Standards of Excellence is an educational program run by C.A.R.E. that is currently required for fraternities and sororities on campus. SASA has requested that the training be required for all OSL organizations and sports teams.</p>\n<p>The current obstacles for Standards of Excellence training concerns the content of the curriculum, which is still under discussion, Ashlock said. OSL plans to meet with C.A.R.E. to review the Standards of Excellence.</p>\n<p>Alvarez gave an update on SASA’s third Ask, which requests a redesigned Public Accountability Report modeled after UCLA’s Title IX Office. UCLA’s model features an “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB currently produces an annual report, SASA feels that shifting to UCLA’s model will provide more thorough information.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Title IX Office is in the process of considering which aspects of UCLA’s model may be beneficial for UCSB, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Students and Director of Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Kimberly Equinoa discussed the online accessibility of Gaucho FYI content, another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>Equinoa predicts that the Gaucho FYI content will be accessible online within the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>SASA officers also discussed the Ask that requests $5,000 annually from UCSB. The funds would be used “to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>Ruiz clarified that funds for this request would ideally come from university fees, not student fees.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn suggested a formal proposal and budget for the ask, detailing what the campaign will accomplish. The SASA officers agreed to follow up on this request.</p>\n<p>SASA officers moved on to discuss the National College Health Assessment, a survey distributed to over 100 universities nationwide that assesses students’ “habits, behaviors, and perceptions,” according to National College Health Assessment website.</p>\n<p>The survey questions students on topics ranging from alcohol and drug use to personal safety and violence. It was distributed to UCSB students via email on Feb. 12.</p>\n<p>Ashlock explained that the survey provides reliable national data, allowing administration to see which issues are unique or less prevalent at UCSB. These trends allow administrators to gauge which programs and policies are beneficial.</p>\n<p>Feliciano voiced several of SASA’s concerns regarding the survey, including its lack of trigger warnings and feedback opportunities. He noted that SASA officers were also disturbed that the survey did not list any resources and neglected to give a clear definition of affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>Conway responded that UCSB did not have any jurisdiction over the content of the survey itself, only the email that was sent to students. The email provided a trigger warning, stating that there may be some “personal discomfort with the content of certain questions.”</p>\n<p>Conway also explained that the Health Equity Initiative, a work group that promotes health equity for underserved students, went through the survey last spring and wrote recommendations to the national organization. The group consists of members from RCSGD, C.A.R.E., C.A.P.S., Student Health, the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, Health &amp; Wellness and the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration requested that the SASA Officers compose their feedback in writing to allow them to seriously acknowledge their concerns.</p>\n<p>SASA’s next town hall will take place in Spring Quarter, with exact date and location yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Former Campus United party chair Katie Mukai then filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition</a> against Salari on Jan. 29, arguing that Salari should be removed from her position.</p>\n<p>The council <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/judicial-council-hears-salari-trial/\">heard arguments</a> in <em>Katie Mukai</em> v. <em>Yasamin Salari</em> on Feb. 20, with Mukai named as the petitioner and Salari as the respondent.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Judicial-Council-Opinion-On-Mukai-v.-Salari.pdf\">opinion</a> rules in favor of Mukai.</p>\n<p>“The Respondent’s place of residence constitutes a breach of the Associated Students Legal Code,” the council wrote in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“The Judicial Council determines that the Respondent is not eligible for the position of On­-Campus Senator and finds that the Respondent cannot continue in office as On­-Campus Senator in the 69th Senate.”</p>\n<p>As stated in Associated Students (A.S.) By-­Laws Article III §1(B)(4), seen on page 21 of the most recent version of the legal code, all Senators are required to live amongst their constituents during the fall, winter and spring quarters of their terms.</p>\n<p>Salari’s representation during her trial – former Off-Campus Senator for the 68th Senate Alexandra Gessesse – argued that Salari’s living arrangement did not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents.</p>\n<p>However, the council found that Salari’s “quality of work as a Senator did not pertain to the question of eligibility.”</p>\n<p>Following Salari’s initial admission, the A.S. Senate granted her a one-time exception. During the trial, Gessesse pointed to incidents in the past when Senates granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituencies.</p>\n<p>However, the council invalidated Senate’s ability to do so in Tuesday’s opinion, stating that while Senate has the power to make changes to legal code, they “are not allowed to circumvent the breach of legal code through special exceptions.”</p>\n<p>“The Legal Code of the Associated Students is the foremost authority on Associated Students rules and regulations and cannot be superseded by Senate motions and resolutions,” the council wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>“The Students of UCSB are entitled to representation by individuals living among them. Allowing a one-­time exception to the eligibility requirements for these representative positions undermines this principle and is harmful towards the constituents’ needs.”</p>\n<p>Salari will be allowed to keep her Fall Quarter 2018 honoraria, and can apply for her Winter Quarter 2019 honoraria.</p>\n<p>The next runner up to take her place is second-year history of public policy major Eric Moon, according to Spring Quarter 2018 Election results.</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time if or when Salari’s seat will be filled. The individual to take her place will only serve for a little more than two months before the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student employee affected by UCPath’s implementation will receive $150 after taxes, and employees with paycheck issues that spanned more than one month will “receive additional compensation, as appropriate, up to a maximum of $450,” according to the press release.  </span></p>\n<p>This includes about 750 students, or approximately 2.5 percent of UCPath employees, according to Claire Doan, UC director of Media Relations.</p>\n<p>The university will send a notification letter and a check to the affected employees within 60 business days.</p>\n<p>Students who are represented by the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union of Academic Student Employees (UAW 2865), and who do not receive payment, should contact the union; unrepresented students who do not receive payment should reach out to their campus payroll representative, Doan said in an email. </span></p>\n<p>“Student leaders told us that students whose pay was disrupted were being subjected to late fees and other fines ranging from $10 to $150. We decided to apply the high end of that range to everyone affected and accounted for taxes, so impacted employees will receive a net of $150,” Doan said.</p>\n<p>“We believe it is important to address the financial hardships of the small number of students who experienced payroll problems and reached out to the union with a proposal to provide these payments. After months of negotiations with UAW, we believe we have reached a fair agreement to help impacted students.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath, UC’s new payment system, has </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caused disruptions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the UC system since its implementation in Fall Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fall 2018 implementation of UCPath… resulted in paycheck inaccuracies for hundreds of academic student employees on several UC campuses,” the joint press release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC greatly appreciates UAW’s partnership in identifying and working through these issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s chapter of the UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/uaw-meets-with-administration-in-impromptu-meeting-demands-ucsb-solve-back-pay-issues-by-feb-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously met</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the UCSB administration on Jan. 31 to discuss UCPath issues, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Graduate Student Union has also been lobbying the administration to fix issues with UCPath since its implementation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system will be implemented at two other campuses, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, within the coming weeks.

An <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">updated version of the Asks</a> was then posted to SASA’s website on Feb. 4.</p>\n<p>The first of the Asks requests the Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education office (C.A.R.E.), Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the UC Police Department and the Women’s Center, among others, to be required to attend an open town hall at the beginning of each quarter “for students to voice their questions and concerns.”</p>\n<p>The updated version of the Asks says that the timing of the town hall must be confirmed with SASA at least three weeks in advance, “along with any administrative reports that will be discussed at the Town Hall.”</p>\n<p>This first Ask has already begun implementation – there was a town hall on Nov. 7, and the next town hall is set for Feb. 25, according to Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) director Emily Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“I think the last town hall went well, I’m happy that we left the town hall with written-down agreements that we all talked about and what each individual in that room is responsible for,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“Those type of conversations with administration then kind of morphed these [updated] Asks.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford added that SASA has spoken to multiple members of UCSB administration in order to begin implementing the rest of the Asks, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, UCSB Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez, C.A.R.E. director Briana Conway and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead, among others.</p>\n<p>The second Ask says that UCSB must provide SASA with “five thousand dollars annually and by the start of the fiscal year— beginning in 2019— in order to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The original list of Asks did not specify the amount needed to fund the campaign.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said SASA hasn’t spoken to administration about this Ask yet.</p>\n<p>“I assume Margaret would be the best person to speak to about this,” Montalvo-Telford said. “I believe it’s absolutely necessary that we receive this amount of funds.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford clarified that SASA does not believe that these funds should be coming from student fees, and instead the funds should be coming from “the university itself.”</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>The updated list of Asks adds that the UCSB Title IX office “must redesign their website to make the information more accessible to students, faculty, and staff.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that there seems to be some pushback from administration in regards to updating UCSB’s Public Accountability Report so it models UCLA’s, but she is confident that SASA can “work something out” with the administration.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration has yet to agree to make amendments to its current Public Accountability Report.</p>\n<p>“We definitely need to have more conversations about what this Public Accountability Report would look like for our campus,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>UCLA’s Public Accountability Report provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“The difference between our campus and the UCLA campus, to my knowledge, is that the UCLA Title IX office and the UCLA Discrimination Prevention office work together to produce this report, versus here, there seems to be a greater distinction between [those two entities] when they’re producing these numbers,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“The Public Accountability report provided by the UCLA office is so much more thorough, has more information, and it’s just easier to read, it’s easier to understand, easier to follow,” she added. “While it is about the content, it’s also about how easy that content is to be absorbed.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX office has said that they made edits to the website in order to increase accessibility, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The fourth Ask was not on the original list of Asks – it says that UCSB “must make C.A.R.E.’s Standard of Excellence Training mandatory for OSL organizations and sports teams/clubs.”</p>\n<p>The fifth Ask is new as well, adding that the C.A.R.E office “must provide online access to their Standard of Excellence Training modules regarding healthy relationships and sexual violence and sexual harassment prevention.”</p>\n<p>In order to address both of these Asks, SASA has created subcommittees that consist of Alvarez, Conway, Associate Dean of Students Kim Equinoa, and Director of the Office of Student Life Miles Ashlock.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that the subcommittees are “working together to try to figure out the most realistic and effective way to implement [the Asks].”</p>\n<p>Currently, the fraternities and sororities are the only organizations required to undergo the Standard of Excellence Training. However, Montalvo-Telford wants that to expand that. She said she believes that the fourth Ask is feasible.</p>\n<p>“We’re not suggesting that the same methods be used to implement the Standard of Excellence Training that is provided by C.A.R.E., what we’re suggesting is that there is a way to make this training mandatory for different groups on campus.”</p>\n<p>The first subcommittee meeting is this week, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The final updated Ask states that UCSB must “provide online access to the Gaucho FYI content.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, SASA “must be provided an opportunity to contribute to and review Gaucho FYI material upon any decisions to alter any content.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that this final updated Ask is “in its route to being met.”</p>\n<p>SASA has spoken to Equinoa about creating an “online, accessible format of Gaucho FYI” and that Equinoa confirmed that it was possible, according to Montalvo-Telford. Montalvo-Telford believes it can be implemented in time for next year’s Gaucho FYI content.</p>\n<p>SASA also plans to work with administration to provide next year’s Gaucho FYI presentation.</p>\n<p>“To my understanding, what Kim has agreed to right now is allowing us to review the content, give any suggestions we might have,” Montalvo-Telford said. “It has not been said specifically that we have voting power [on the content] but that could be the product of a further conversation.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Montalvo-Telford is satisfied with the progress that has been made regarding the Asks, and she believes that the administration has been very upfront and realistic with SASA.</p>\n<p>“It’s always going to be hard when you’re working with so many different offices trying to figure out the correct solution, but we have been able come together in a room, spit out ideas, and work with each other.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

makeup company, which is primarily sold online and in select Sephora and Ulta stores, garnered fame for its liquid lipsticks when it first launched and has since grown to encompass a variety of skincare and makeup products.</p>\n<p>Mukai has only been working for the company as a marketing intern for three weeks, but during this time has focused on laying the foundation for the college ambassador program alongside her supervisors at Colourpop.</p>\n<p>UCSB was chosen as the pilot school for the ambassador program after Mukai was selected as the intern and because of Santa Barbara’s vicinity to the Colourpop headquarters in Oxnard, Calif.</p>\n<p>“This will be kind of the test run to see what works, what doesn’t work, how to make the program better, how can we fit it to Colourpop better, how can we fit it to campuses better, so that when we start recruiting more schools we have kind of like that basic blueprint work in order to keep it going,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s main responsibilities as the college ambassador include running the social media platforms and organizing giveaways and trunk shows to highlight Colourpop’s product lines on campus.</p>\n<p>Mukai said that her passion for makeup is what sparked her interest in working for Colourpop.</p>\n<p>“I just was looking at the Linkedin job page every other day for weeks, and then finally a job popped up and I applied for it. I had a few rounds of interviews, and thank god I got the job!” Mukai laughed.</p>\n<p>Since Mukai is within driving distance from the headquarters, she travels to the office twice a week, where she works closely with a wide variety of departments.</p>\n<p>“Colourpop, for people that are into business and things like that, is a completely vertically integrated company, so like everything from like the conception of a product all the way to it going out of the doors and to a customer is all through Colourpop,” Mukai said.</p>\n<p>She described the office as having a “start-up feel,” and praised the company for the number of women in authority roles, a stark difference from a previous employer.</p>\n<p>“For me being a young person going into the workforce …. it’s really cool to see all these women of power like just doing the work. They are the reason why the company runs,” Mukai added.</p>\n<p>Being in the office also allowed her to get a better sense of the company’s personality, Mukai said, which has helped her learn more about how to merge the company’s brand and UCSB’s brand.</p>\n<p>Mukai officially launched UCSB’s Colourpop College Instagram page on Tuesday, and said she was pleasantly surprised by the reaction from UCSB students, noting that the page reached 500 followers in the first 24 hours.</p>\n<p>“The interesting part is either people absolutely know what [Colourpop] is and they love it or they’re like ‘what is this?’” she said.</p>\n<p>She had previously worked for two years as the campus representative for PINK, a subset of Victoria’s Secret, which she believes is why she was hired to help launch the Colourpop College program.</p>\n<p>While she says the responsibilities are similar on paper, it’s been a learning curve for Mukai as she transitions from advertising clothing to advertising makeup.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to take what I learned from UCSB PINK and apply it to this, but I realize more and more how different it is being a representative or an ambassador for makeup rather than clothing, ‘cause everyone wears clothing – not everyone wears makeup,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86418\" style=\"width: 702px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86418\" data-attachment-id=\"86418\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/ucsb-student-lays-foundation-for-first-ever-colourpop-college-program/screen-shot-2019-02-21-at-11-46-49-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"692,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-21 at 11.46.49 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86418 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=692%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"692\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?w=692&amp;ssl=1 692w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Even though makeup is her passion, Mukai said she wouldn’t consider herself an expert. She plans on reaching out to students on campus to populate the Instagram page with creative, hyperlocal and “eye-catching” content.</p>\n<p>After getting the program off the ground, Mukai wants to focus on spotlighting these students, especially those “with smaller followings than the big beauty influencers, but [who] are equally, if not more, talented.”</p>\n<p>She said that one of her favorite aspects of Colourpop is their attention to smaller influencers, and hopes to continue that at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve already found so many talented people on campus,” Mukai said. “I get to bring those people to the forefront, like ‘look how beautiful they are! look at that cut crease, or look at that skin!’ and just kind of hopefully give them also a platform to succeed.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest talking points for the Colourpop College is the trunk shows that Mukai plans to host on campus. Since Colourpop is primarily an online store and only stocks certain Sephora or Ulta locations with a limited range of products, it is hard to get a good feel for the shades and textures of products before buying them, Mukai said.</p>\n<p>The trunk show plans to bring a large range of Colourpop products to campus so students can swatch, and even buy them, to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>While Mukai is the sole college ambassador for now, she hopes that the program can grow both on campus and at college campuses across California and then across the country.</p>\n<p>“I think not only is this a great professional opportunity in terms of learning about the industry that you wanna be in, but also it’s just a really fun way to get to know people and share a community of people that love makeup and love beauty and love skincare and things of all those natures,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s love for Colourpop comes from both a consumer and a student point of view, she said. For one, Mukai praised the company for the affordability and quality of their products.</p>\n<p>“There is, more importantly, a range of colors that fit all skin tones, which I’ve been surprised to see,” she added.</p>\n<p>“I don’t mean to politicize makeup, but at this time and age, I don’t feel like you can’t politicize things, like I think that’s silly…. politics in some way touches every part of our lives, and I think that happens with makeup too, so it’s been great to see the makeup industry pay attention.”</p>\n<p>As she works to solidify the program in the coming months, Mukai hopes to ultimately build a community around beauty and skincare products for students.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s a really important part of this college program as it continues and hopefully grows, that they’ll be more of an uplifting of multiple people.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or skamidi@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

<em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>Former A.S. Attorney General Ali Suebert represented Mukai in the case against Salari, arguing that Senator Salari violated legal code by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">living off-campus</a> and that she is unable “to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” according to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition.</a></p>\n<p>“We feel that it is unfair that someone is able to run for a position and campaign as an on-campus senator, getting votes from on-campus students, when other people are running for the same election under the same legal code expecting to have the same laws that they were held to,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Senator Alexandra Gessesse, representing Salari, defended Salari on the basis that her off-campus living arrangement does not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents and that her extenuating financial circumstances prevented Salari from living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“Understanding that she doesn’t live within her constituency is real and is a serious matter,” Gessesse said. “But Senator Salari has actively and continuously… supported the constituency in which she is elected to live in.”</p>\n<p>Salari said she based her decision to live off campus on her financial aid reward and changes in her family’s ability to pay for her tuition.</p>\n<p>“I had the fullest intention of living on-campus when I found out I was elected for Senate, however this changed after my election as I received my financial aid package,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Citing financial struggles, Salari said that she and her family “decided that taking out more loans would not be beneficial to my education and long-term academic endeavors.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this, Salari found that her only option would be to live in her sorority house, where her financial aid would cover the costs.</p>\n<p>“I had to fall back on living in my sorority house in order to make sure that my financial aid would cover all the costs for my housing,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s attempt to remove her from her Senate position “inherently violates the student bill of rights” in that it would “be taking a leadership position away from an elected student due to circumstances completely out of our hands,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>“Where’s the sense of decency and understanding that students face different struggles?” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Gessesse referred to past incidents in which A.S. Senate granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituency.</p>\n<p>“We [should] ask ourselves what makes Senator Salari different between the one-time exceptions that have been granted in the past,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>But Suebert contends that Senate did not have the authority to grant such exceptions, which would circumvent the power of Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“The only person who is allowed to make exceptions to Legal Code… is the attorney general or the Judicial Council,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Suebert said that while Senate can re-write or amend Legal Code for future situations, they cannot grant exceptions intended to bypass current Legal Code. These checks and balances of powers with A.S. are designed for fairness among senators, which she said need to be maintained.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to make sure that all students that ran in spring election during the campaign, who also may have faced financial hardship, still are held under the same legal obligations of other students who also ran,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>The petitioning team called in Lea Toubian, a current on-campus senator, to testify about how living within her constituency affected her ability to fulfill on-campus duties.</p>\n<p>“I think it keeps me more attuned. Since I’m still living [on-campus], it’s pretty relevant to me, but it is difficult to reach all parts of the res-hall community. I think that’s why we have like four different positions,” Tubian said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I wouldn’t have been able to reach [students living at San Rafael] if I wasn’t an on-campus senator.”</p>\n<p>Toubian also said that running as an on-campus senator as a freshman in the Spring Quarter 2018 election, like Salari, was easier for herself since she already lived in on-campus housing and was familiar with the on campus student community.</p>\n<p>Gessesse countered that although Salari lives off-campus, she is capable of serving her constituency, which can be seen through her involvement in projects such as bring rollover dining common swipes to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Gessesse additionally argued that Salari had, in fact, adhered to Legal Code by meeting with A.S. Elections Board in regards to her living situation. A.S. Elections Board subsequently dismissed the complaint, according to Gessesse.</p>\n<p>Salari’s transparency in regards to her off-campus living situation during a Senate meeting in Fall Quarter 2018 testifies to her compliance with Legal Code and fulfillment of duties as an on-campus senator. Despite living off-campus, Salari “followed all policies that were in place when she was elected,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The responding team also brought On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon to testify about their experience as an off-campus senator. Solomon testified that the projects they worked on as a senator are determined more by her personal passions than her designated constituency.</p>\n<p>Solomon also testified that Salari’s accessibility to on-campus students was “better than my own,” citing that Salari’s office hours are held on campus and that Salari specifically focuses on on-campus issues.</p>\n<p>At the end of closing statements, Salari asked that the Judicial Council review her case in light of the work she has done for her constituency and the financial circumstances she faced.</p>\n<p>“My work should matter more. That’s what affects students more. That’s what students care about, not where I live and where I can’t afford to live,” Salari said. “My work is directly affecting students and wanting to remove will end those projects that are positively affecting them.”</p>\n<p>Salari also asked that the Judicial Council review her case as an indicator of the changes in Legal Code needed to accommodate the current student body.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for the council to respond to the changing needs of student body and interpret Legal Code accordingly.”</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño, provides elected officials who fail to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in legal code — such as an on-campus senator living off campus, as in the case of On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari — the opportunity to continue serving their terms.</p>\n<p>The elected official would have to obtain approval from both the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>The resolution is a modification of Standing Policy 36, which was introduced two Senate meetings ago by Uribe and Briseño. The policy would have given Senate the power to decide whether or not to grant a senator a one-time exception for their situation. The new bill also broadens the scope of the policy from senators to all elected officers.</p>\n<p>However, senators at the Feb. 20 meeting argued that because Senate is a partisan body, they would feel more comfortable if a nonpartisan body or office were in charge of granting the exception.</p>\n<p>“In terms of A.S., they [S.A.G.] are the most non-partisan,” Senator Uribe said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Student Advocate is the only executive position within A.S. that is nonpartisan, as anyone running for the position must run as an independent.</p>\n<p>Aside from shifting the responsibility of reviewing an elected officer’s case to a nonpartisan body, the bill also aims to provide further clarification within the standing policy as it is.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Briseño commented on the ambiguity of A.S. legal code, noting that it is a “gray area” that causes friction amongst A.S. entities, such as when it comes to determining an elected official’s eligibility under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>This bill aims to combat legal code ambiguity problems by providing details to further clarify what factors will be included when reviewing an elected official’s eligibility.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that “External circumstances, such as to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” will be considered when reviewing the eligibility of an elected officer.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez is the student sponsor on the resolution.</p>\n<p>Martinez did not respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>The bill originates from the Senate’s one-time exception granted to Salari during the Nov. 14 Senate meeting. When the Senate granted Salari the exception, they also included a stipulation to discuss living situations, like her’s, in the A.S. Internal Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is currently hearing a case against Senator Salari regarding her living situation.</p>\n<p>The resolution noted that instances regarding an elected officer’s living arrangements have been presented in prior senates, with “no action to restructure legal code.”</p>\n<p>The resolution will reappear at next Wednesday’s senate meeting.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Acacia is located across the street from Embarcadero Hall.</em> Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Their I.V. office – located across the street from Embarcadero Hall, behind Cajé Cafe on Embarcadero del Norte – is the closest long-term counseling offered for UC Santa Barbara students, providing individual therapy, group therapy and psychiatry services.</p>\n<p>Acacia was founded in 2014 by Dr. Keith Higginbotham and Dr. Brett Donnelly. The two psychologists noticed a growing demand for mental health services while working at UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>As a result, many students were referred to community providers to ensure consistent scheduling and shorter wait times. However, students faced several barriers to accessing these outside services, such as transportation issues, cost difficulties and provider availability.</p>\n<p>Recognizing these barriers, Higginbotham and Donnelly embraced an opportunity to create an accessible, welcoming therapy center to meet the growing needs of the student population.</p>\n<p>“We made it our mission to help students get the longer term care that they need and really address the barriers,” Higginbotham said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Acacia has been providing services to the I.V. community for upwards of five years. Today, the office works in conjunction with C.A.P.S. to ensure an effective treatment plan for each patient.</p>\n<p>Students seeking treatment first attend C.A.P.S. on campus, where they may be referred for long-term care at Acacia.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is a really important function in doing crisis work, that short-term treatment, and a lot of the outreach and education. We want to be their premier referral service by providing the best treatment and hiring therapists who are really well-skilled in working with student issues,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>Robbyn Jackson, clinical psychologist and lead director of Acacia’s I.V. office, said he is passionate about successfully serving the needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I see my role as finding the best clinicians I can to meet the needs of the student population. I’m always looking for really good quality therapists who are passionate about the work we do, and make sure that we are helping as many students as possible every week,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The office is also home to Charlie the therapy dog, a trained therapy animal that brightens the I.V. community on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>With more than 16 therapists on staff, Higginbotham said that Acacia has a diverse pool of providers so as to make people with all identities feel welcome in their office. If a therapist at another clinic has an identity that someone is looking for, Acacia hopes to connect them through video sessions.</p>\n<p>Acacia also partners with several other organizations on campus, including C.A.R.E., the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) and the Disabled Students Program (DSP) to ensure quality mental health care to students of all identities.</p>\n<p>“We really appreciate the relationship with the university, to sort of work hand in hand with them, with referrals, understanding what the needs are that they’re seeing. We love to be able to reach out and partner with them as much as we can,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>The Acacia <a href=\"https://www.acaciaroots.org/\">Resources, Outreach, and Outpatient Therapy for Students (R.O.O.T.S)</a> non-profit project is also dedicated to aiding low-income students in accessing mental health services. Students and members of the community consistently raise funds for the project, which go toward mental health education and outreach as well.</p>\n<p>The office also runs the Mental Health Advocates Internship program, in which students that are interested in the psychology field can gain hands-on experience.</p>\n<p>“We do mock therapy sessions together so they can get a feel for what it’s like to be in the field, and they do events and all kinds of stuff for us. It’s a really great opportunity,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Higginbotham, therapy has the potential to significantly change individuals’ lives for the better, especially young people.</p>\n<p>“You see a lot of growth, you see a lot of confidence building, and some people are just very different people today than when they came in,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students are encouraged to access Acacia’s services through a referral from C.A.P.S. Students and members of the community can also access Acacia’s services through their <a href=\"https://www.acaciacw.com/isla-vista-appointment\">online registration form.</a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Legal Code, the governing document of all A.S. entities, requires executives to complete at least six units per quarter — making them at least a half-time student — during the spring quarter in which they are elected and each of the subsequent fall, winter and spring quarters of their term.</p>\n<p>The executives — current S.A.G. Grecia Martinez, former EVPSA Kristin Hsu, former President James Villarreal ‘16 and former EVPSA Melvin Singh ‘15 – either withdrew or canceled their enrollment or took fewer than the required number of units at some point during their terms, according to student enrollment records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi said she is currently investigating Martinez’s withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018 to determine whether there is cause for a Judicial Council case. Martinez said she believes she did not violate any requirement.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew from Fall Quarter 2018, Hsu canceled her Spring Quarter 2018 and Villarreal dropped below half-time during Winter Quarter 2016. Singh canceled Winter Quarter 2015 and there is no record of him attending UCSB in Spring Quarter 2015.</p>\n<p>Last spring, former EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> before being sworn in after it was discovered she had canceled her classes for the quarter, making her ineligible for her position.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if A.S. executives from previous years would have been allowed to serve if it came to light that they were taking fewer than six credits.</p>\n<p>Executive officers receive $3,000 per quarter – taken from student fees and paid directly to their BARC accounts — for serving the student body.</p>\n<p>Cindy Lopez, A.S. assistant director for finance and budget, confirmed that all executives who the <em>Nexus</em> found had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or dropped below half-time over the last five years received their $3,000 stipends each quarter and that none had returned the money.</p>\n<p>Students who withdraw before the beginning of a quarter have their registration canceled and receive a full refund, the UCSB Office of the Registrar <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/registration-enrollment/registration-enrollment/withdraw-from-the-university\">website</a> says. It is unclear what Hsu and Singh, the executives who canceled their quarters, used the $3,000 for.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez directed all questions regarding consequences for failing to meet eligibility requirements to Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>Raymond Alonso, who leads the Judicial Council, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>“What the Legal Code is missing are the consequences, if any, that come with not being enrolled as a student,” A.G. Safadi told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew on Dec. 7, the last day of instruction for Fall Quarter 2018. Hsu declined to comment. Singh and Villarreal did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Records also show that two other executives, former A.S. President Hieu Le ‘18 and former S.A.G. Josephine Ampaw ‘17, did not complete the minimum six units for their respective quarters.</p>\n<p>However, Le withdrew from Spring Quarter 2018 about six days after his term had ended and his successor, current A.S. President Brooke Kopel, had taken office. Le declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ampaw retroactively withdrew from two of her classes after the end of Fall Quarter 2016, citing a personal family emergency and a desire to protect her GPA.</p>\n<p>“At the time that I was doing S.A.G., I was in those classes,” Ampaw said in an interview. “It’d be important to also state that regardless of a family emergency, I still worked as S.A.G., and I still served the student population.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she had not been aware of the executives who had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or taken fewer than six units until she was informed by the <em>Nexus</em>. She said executives may not have known they had dipped below the six-unit minimum and that she wished she had known so she and other A.S. staffers could have provided them with resources and support.</p>\n<p>Lopez and Marquez are responsible for checking executives’ enrollment status before paying them, but Legal Code does not require them to check their enrollment status throughout the year.</p>\n<p>A.S. senators, BCU officers and all other non-executives who are paid by the association have their enrollment checked at the end of each quarter, making it more likely that a change in enrollment status would be caught and their honoraria affected, Lopez said.</p>\n<p>The $3,000 stipend for executives — originally intended to cover all or part of tuition — is paid before each quarter starts, on Sept. 15, Dec. 15 and March 15 for fall, winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Marquez said that her job is to check an executive’s enrollment before paying them, and “outside of that, I would imagine that it’s on them to report it or give it back.”</p>\n<p>S.A.G. Martinez, who withdrew from the university while serving during the Fall Quarter 2018 but is currently enrolled, maintained that she did not violate the Legal Code and said there is a “gray area” in the eligibility clause.</p>\n<p>She argued that since the clause for executives falls under the eligibility portion of Legal Code, the by-laws serve as expectations for candidates running for positions, not obligations to be upheld.</p>\n<p>“This is supported by the fact that the clauses included in those same sections are all worded in language concerning a candidate’s [eligibility] for an election,” she wrote in a message after her interview.</p>\n<p>Martinez said Legal Code should be clarified so that expectations and exceptions for executives are clearly outlined.</p>\n<p>If a Judicial Council case were filed against her, Martinez said it would “spark a bigger conversation about what should be done in special situations like this,” but she doesn’t believe it would be the right step.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe I’m in violation,” Martinez said. “I mean, I was a student. I did my job and I was a student at the same time.”</p>\n<p>A full version of A.S. Legal Code can be viewed below.

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Food for All Coalition held its first meeting at the Biko Garage on Friday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The coalition – made up of various students groups dedicated to fighting food insecurity – was created last October following the UCSB Food Security and Sustainable Food Systems Leadership Retreat.</p>\n<p>“[The retreat] was awesome; it was having everyone together because that never happens [and] we were drafting different ideas,” Michaela Austin said, a fourth-year sociology and environmental studies double major and student ambassador for the UC Global Food Initiative, said.</p>\n<p>The retreat brought together student organizations including the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, CalFresh, the UC Global Food Initiative, the Edible Campus Program, FoodCycling, Food, Nutrition, and Basic Skills Program, the Food Security Taskforce Student Reps, ECOalition and Food Security Peer Advisors.</p>\n<p>For Austin, who presided over Friday’s meeting, the goal of the coalition was obvious.</p>\n<p>“[The purpose is] very simple. Update each other, build coalition[s] and again, the goal is to get food insecurity on campus to as low a rate as possible,” Austin said. “If there is a problem we all agree on, let’s go to the UC with a unified voice.”</p>\n<p>Some of the positive updates and successful programs on- and off-campus were discussed at the opening of the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Etaat highlighted the achievements of the CalFresh Advocacy Team and the A.S. Food Bank. He explained that the CalFresh Advocacy Team had over 76 engagement activities during Fall Quarter 2018, which included tabling and enrollment parties.</p>\n<p>“We got well over 2,000 people enrolled in CalFresh that we know of through the program and this year’s benchmark is 6,000,” Etaat, a fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major and USDA Food Insecurity Research intern, said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, several students also discussed the accessibility of food security and sustainability programs are to underserved students. Marilu Bedolla, a fourth-year language, culture and society major, noted that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are unable to access CalFresh.</p>\n<p>Due to their ineligibility for the federal program, which has no locally funded alternative, undocumented students remain neglected, Marilu emphasized.</p>\n<p>“That is a constant issue that we don’t know what to do with it. CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?” Austin replied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Right now, the main things we have been pushing [are] what we do have on campus, which are the food pantries and free prepared meals.”</p>\n<p>Jack Greenberg, a third-year cultural anthropology major and employee at the I.V. Food Co-op, brought up the possibility of having a plot of land in the <a href=\"http://ucsbosl.orgsync.com/org/ghgp/home\">Greenhouse and Garden project</a> to serve the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends is looking to start an undocumented plot in the Greenhouse and Garden project … hopefully that will be a resource also where it can be already paid for and once it grows actual food can be [made available].”</p>\n<p>Those in attendance also expressed concern about CalFresh availability at on-campus convenience stores, stating that the Arbor remains the only on-campus institution to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/\">accept the program</a>.</p>\n<p>The lack of whole foods, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, at the Arbor was another point of concern with food availability for CalFresh recipients.</p>\n<p>Students also discussed the closure of the UC Global Food Initiative, which was intended as a short-term kickstart for campuses to address food security.</p>\n<p>“We still have to do that work; we want [those programs] to be funded — it’s not a given,” Austin noted.</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition is in the process of becoming a permanent standing committee under A.S. with support from A.S. Senators Anthony Hernandez, Rafael Cornejo, Gabriella Shofet and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">Sydney Karmes-Wainer</a>.</p>\n<p>“We accept everyone who wants to come, whether they’re on-campus organizations or off-campus organizations [and] as a standing committee under A.S., you get all the benefits of A.S. as well,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Hernandez wants to work on increasing turnout for the meetings. He noted his concerns about having a low turnout of students since the meetings are scheduled for Fridays.</p>\n<p>“We thought about having a night market while we have the meeting since it’s Friday night and people are going to [Del Playa]… We want to build a culture around it, so that way people know about [Food for All].”</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition holds biweekly Friday meetings at Biko Garage from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-86267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The theater troupe spent weeks before the event tabling in the Arbor and inviting students to attend the show. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe President, Jalia Carlton-Carew, said auditions and initial preparations for the production began mid-Fall Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though these pieces are from the ‘90s, they still hold truth because they were still pieces inspired by people’s lived experiences at that time,” Carlton-Carew, a third-year film and media studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The casting process produced an array of people who could accurately portray the stories in “The Vagina Monologues,” according to Carlton-Carew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we have random people who just saw the show, like maybe the year before… I was just so interested after watching the show my first year that I knew I had to be a part of it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Carlton-Carew handles most of the logistics of the production, she will also be performing a self-written Herstory entitled “When I Was Seven,” in which she discusses her personal experience of black femininity in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really important culturally for people to be aware of all the topics that we talk about because they play into a wide range of stories… Pieces from the original monologues still relate today,” Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe Vice President, Kate Rossb, said she was inspired to become part of the production when she first saw the show her freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, [the show is] about people. We do target the female experience, but we also target nonbinary folk,” Ross said. “A lot of our pieces reflect cisgender women and trans women — a real variety of people and diverse experiences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of a wide range of speakers, characters and actors makes “The Vagina Monologues” and Herstories influential on a college campus such as UCSB, Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a special quality about seeing familiar faces on stage performing, Ross noted, saying that one of the ways in which the monologues succeed is in their ability to portray a spectrum of perspectives through real and relatable people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easier to distance yourself when it’s someone else’s words coming out of people’s mouths, but when you’re seeing someone up there, telling their story, and they’re your peers or it’s your sister or your friend or your friend’s friend, it definitely connects you more [to the story],” Ross said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Vagina Monologues” also provide an space for open discussions about current political and social dilemmas. This is one of the most important contributions “The Vagina Monologues” makes to the community, Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given our political climate now, you can’t afford to say something is ‘not your problem,’ even if it doesn’t pertain to you directly because the world is so interconnected. You will feel some impact based on that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if you aren’t influenced by people’s stories and what they’re performing, it’s still good to be educated about what other people’s experiences are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Monologues often deal with issues faced by students at university and reveal insights about students’ experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day,” Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After months of preparation and refining, Carew, Ross and the rest of the UCSB Women’s Theatre Troupe will finally showcase the production this weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the show’s earnings will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, an organization that provides confidential counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault and their loved ones, and the One Billion Rising Campaign, a global movement that aims to end rape and sexual violence against women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In anticipation for the production, Ross is looking forward to finally seeing the pieces come to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing everyone perform their pieces is really inspiring. It really warms my heart to see how much passion everyone is bringing to their stories.”</span></p>\n<p>Tickets can be purchased at the Associated Students ticket office.</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

It passed unanimously during the meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“There is a lack of concept continuity among incoming AS Presidents which can perpetuate a culture of unfinished projects that may waste AS resources,” the bill states, arguing that Associated Students (A.S.) Presidents can be “limited” in their abilities to finish projects due to their one-year terms.</p>\n<p>The creation of the position was one of Kopel’s main projects that she hoped to accomplish during her term as A.S. President.</p>\n<p>“Particularly with this office, and especially my projects, [these] are definitely more long-term projects,” Kopel said in an interview with the <i>Nexus </i>earlier last week.</p>\n<p>“Having that position is really crucial in making sure that there’s no transition divide that would inhibit the projects from being carried through.”</p>\n<p>The position must be filled by someone who will be at UC Santa Barbara for the entirety of the 2019-2020 school year and is also familiar with the type of projects that the Office of the President takes on.</p>\n<p>The filling of the position is up to Kopel’s discretion, without prior approval from the Senate, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The position’s duties entail staying up to date on all of the president’s short-term and long term projects, meeting with the president once a week, meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez once a quarter, attending at least two Senate meetings per quarter, being in attendance and taking notes at all project-related meetings with the president, holding two office hours per week and serving at least four quarters over a span of two academic years.</p>\n<p>Kopel said that ideally she would transition one of her fellows into fulfilling that position.</p>\n<p>“Since all of my fellows are first-years, they will definitely be here next year and next Fall Quarter to transition or help the new president in any way that they can.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> held at the beginning of her term, Kopel said that being in A.S. for so long – first as a caseworker with the Office of the Student Advocate and then as a Letters and Science Senator for the 68th Senate – prompted her to create the position.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many fantastic ideas that students in these leadership positions [come up with] but cannot accomplish in a year,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“That’s shameful that you have something that would be so beneficial for this community, the campus community, and it’s literally just not accomplished because there’s bureaucratic issues.”</p>\n<p>She admitted that the position may not fix the projects problem entirely, but believes that “attempting it would be a great start.”</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:20 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
