Rob Romero said Chen was arrested in Alameda County on an unrelated felony drug charge, during which authorities swabbed the inside of his mouth for DNA, ultimately leading to the rape charges.</p>\n<p>When police in Alameda County ran Chen’s DNA through an FBI database, it matched evidence found at the UCSB crime scene. Chen was transferred to Santa Barbara County Jail on Wednesday, about a week after university police learned of the DNA match, Romero said.</p>\n<p>The victim filed a personal injury <strong><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a></strong> in January alleging, among other claims, that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the case.</p>\n<p>Tyrone Maho, one of two attorneys representing the victim, said Thursday that his client was “relieved” to hear about the arrest.</p>\n<p>“Our client was really pleased that this developed,” Maho said. “I’m just hoping it leads to the location and the prosecution of any other assailants involved.”</p>\n<p>Romero said that while the DNA match was a lucky break, UCPD has continued to investigate the case since 2014.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we were fortunate from the DNA hit, but we were never not motivated to solve this case,” Romero said Thursday. “We do know there’s a lawsuit out there but we’ve just been grinding and chipping away at this case.”</p>\n<p>In its statement, UCSB said, “We deeply appreciate the multiagency search that led to the uncovering and collection of DNA evidence, which has now resulted in the arrest of a suspect. This is a crucial step toward achieving justice and preventing future tragedies.”</p>\n<p>The university said that while the arrest is a step forward, “it may bring renewed pain to our student and her family.”</p>\n<p>“We keep them in our thoughts, as we have for the past two years, and we continue to offer our unwavering support and heartfelt sympathy.”</p>\n<p>Chen is currently being held without bail in Santa Barbara County Jail. He will be arraigned Feb. 16 in Santa Barbara Superior Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/","id":2585,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2584,2583,2582],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two A.S.

OPP was disbanded earlier this month as two new political parties, Campus United and the Peer Action Coalition, were created within the last week in an attempt to bring more diversity to the A.S. senate board. A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a single transferable vote system the student elections system to a single transferrable vote (STV) process was passed in October and will go into effect this spring which will use ranking averages instead of singular votes to choose election winners.</p>\n<p>Dustin Larrazolo, PAC member and third-year biochemistry major, said PAC was created to provide “all-inclusive” and non-toxic spaces within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to bring everyone home to A.S. I want to open up these spaces so that the people can tell us what to do,” Larrazolo said. “The students are the leaders and we [senate] are the vote. I’m strong proponent of that and democratic caucuses.”</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, PAC member and second-year philosophy, psychology and sociology triple major, said the goal of the Peer Action Coalition is to create a safe and accepting space for students of all backgrounds to experience A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure every Gaucho feels that they can have their voice heard through our group, whether it’s them wanting to actively help us with campaigning or if it’s them addressing concerns with future candidates,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, Campus United member and third-year biopsychology major, said Campus United was created to put students first as they are the party’s priority.</p>\n<p>“We are all about the student experience and improving it the best that we can and taking action on clear consensus student issues that would benefit all of us,” Elyasi said. “So we are really a student-focused, student-run movement looking to get involved in A.S.”</p>\n<p>Elyasi said Campus United was created to bring more diversity to senate.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get a voice out that we feel hasn’t been heard as vocally and that’s the voice of the students for improved resources and academic distinction on campus,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>According to Yapabandara, the purpose of the PAC is to give UCSB students from diverse backgrounds a chance to be represented by senators who identify with them.</p>\n<p>“Up until now, A.S. has been a very particular type of UCSB student,” Yapabandara said. “As someone who was a campaign manager for one of the two major political parties last year, I remember feeling very left out because the students Senate has had in the past were of a particular social group.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said PAC is comprised of student leaders from Senate, the Office of Student Life, Resident Hall Council and various other student groups to give the party.</p>\n<p>“A.S. programs only benefits about 20 percent of students and we strive to expand that through collaborations with Office of Student Life Organizations, the Residence Halls Association and student clubs to let students understand what resources are available,” Larrazolo said. “We strive to have the multiplicity representative of our university because every student is a part of A.S. I don’t think only 23 people should handle 11 million dollars.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she was unable to run with the Open People’s Party last year despite her desire to run for an A.S. political office.</p>\n<p>“It was very discouraging because I wanted to help make change at the university but did not have the necessary connections to even be able to run with the party,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Campus United member and third-year history of public policy major, said one party cannot adequately represent the student body.</p>\n<p>“I think that it was an inevitable thing where you can’t just have one group that tries to represent everybody because no matter how holistic, how genuine you try to be, it just doesn’t really work,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Villarreal, A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major, said the formation of new parties would be healthy for senate and for the campus.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it is good to have competition. Competition breeds excellence. Complacency breeds mediocrity,” Villareal said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he encourages students to form other political parties that represent them and their values.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to start something new in hopes that other people would continue to make new parties,” Minoiefar said. “We’re hoping that other parties can come up and have their focuses too, so that the parties are more representative of a variety of interest at the school.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said one goal of PAC is to institutionalize education reform to exercise A.S.’s one third-power within university spaces.</p>\n<p>“Students will be able to address their concerns more effectively. Since Academic Affairs Board was disbanded, we have no central power with regard to our academics. What’s the point of A.S. when you can’t even lobby or express concerns in our education when A.S. isn’t there to represent them effectively.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said PAC wants to educate students on the resources available to them since many students do not understand what their student fees fund.</p>\n<p>“We also want to make sure Gauchos know the benefits they can receive from A.S. so that they can utilize their resources on and off campus as necessary,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said Campus United will be focusing on preventing additional student fee increases.</p>\n<p>“We have the highest fees by far out of all the UC’s but we don’t have necessarily an extreme amount of services compared to some other schools,” Minoiefar said. “I think a large focus is to ensure that what we currently take from students is being paid well and also that students are aware of where the money goes.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said A.S. does not have much control over what programs and institutions are funded.</p>\n<p>“Over here our student fees pay for the UCen, they pay for the MCC, they pay for the Rec Cen, they pay for a great deal of stuff that people don’t know they’re being paid for but we have a lot less control,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she is eager to see what happens during the elections because of the multiple parties.</p>\n<p>“I am very excited to see what will happen in this year’s elections because there are so many more parties who are also focusing on other parts of the student population, combined with the new STV system,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said has high hopes for the party’s future come spring elections.</p>\n<p>“I’m very confident in people wanting to join our party and seeing what we have to offer but I do think it will have contributed to a healthier association and a healthier campus,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: This story originally quotes Larrazolo as saying “We want to bring everyone home from A.S. I want to open up these spaces so that people can tell us what to do… The students are the leaders and we [senate] are the vote.

Tuesday evening titled “Second Class Feminists?: The Changing Role of Women in Faith Communities” for panelists and audience members to discuss the intersections of religion and feminism and the role of feminists in religions with patriarchal interpretations.</p>\n<p>The event, which took place at the MultiCultural Center Theater, featured a panel of three feminist scholars of the Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths. Panelists included Gina Messina-Dysert, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies at Ursuline College, Nia Malika Dixon, author, filmmaker and founder of Audaz Entertainment and Rabbi Tamara Cohen, Director of Innovation at Moving Traditions. All three panelists are contributors to <em>Faithfully Feminist</em>, a collection of 45 essays on feminism in religion, for which they held a signing after the event.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Moore, religious studies professor and department chair at UCSB, said although religion and feminism are not inherently opposed, there is conflict generated by people’s expectations that an opposition exists.</p>\n<p>“They are not an either-or dichotomy, although the conflict between religion and feminism is real,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert said it is harmful for nonreligious feminists to discount the work of religious feminists, because the success of feminism depends on working together and mutual support between the two.</p>\n<p>“Individuals who identify as religious and feminists receive a lot of judgment, if you will, from both their religious communities and from feminists,” Messina-Dysert said. “I personally find both damaging, but I find judgment from feminists more damaging.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert offered her definition of feminism, which she said is inspired by those of Bell Hooks and Rosemary Radford Ruether.</p>\n<p>“I like to talk about feminism as being a movement that is focused on eradicating sexism, yes, but all oppression, because you cannot uproot one without uprooting all,” she said.</p>\n<p>Religion needs feminism, according to Messina-Dysert, as it is still inundated with patriarchal interpretations that lead to oppression.</p>\n<p>“Certainly it is necessary for feminism to be a critical part of religious practice,” Messina-Dysert said. “We need to continue to acknowledge the great oppressions that still exist within religious traditions and find the ways that we can create healing.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert spoke specifically about Catholicism to exemplify oppressive religious traditions such as the Vatican’s resistance to reproductive rights and women’s ordination. She said women are a “blind spot” of Pope Francis, who upholds the “theology of complementarity,” which declares a woman’s purpose and value come from her role as a wife and mother.</p>\n<p>Such traditions are not inherently part of religion and should be resisted, according to Messina-Dysert.</p>\n<p>“Certainly, the foundations of religion are not sexist — it’s the interpretations that are,” she said. “Feminism allows us to work toward disrupting those problematic interpretations.”</p>\n<p>Malika Dixon said she believes God gives her the right to stand up for both feminism and religion even though many interpretations hold them in contention.</p>\n<p>“Asking a Muslim ‘why are you feminist?’ to me seems kind of misinformed, because to me, as a Muslim, I believe we are automatically feminist,” Malika Dixon said. “The patriarchy that pervades our religious beliefs is not a part of our beliefs, it’s an interpretation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68035\" style=\"width: 810px\"

traditions such as the unequal status of bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs, which she experienced in her conservative synagogue and orthodox school while growing up.</p>\n<p>“Girls could have a bat mitzvah, but not equal to a bar mitzvah,” Cohen said. “We could read from the Torah only on Friday night, which doesn’t really count, and not on Saturday morning.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said her family chose to have a bar mitzvah for her despite the orthodoxy of her synagogue and school, empowering her to fight for feminist reforms to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>“I had this sense with the way we did it that if something wasn’t fair out there we could change it,” Cohen said. “It wasn’t many years later that a lot of places began to say, yes, you can do it on Saturday morning, and that change happened because women demanded it and feminists demanded it.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she had a crisis of faith after coming out as a lesbian in college, because conservative Judaism did not allow for ordination of LGBT Rabbis, which lead her to a new understanding of feminism.</p>\n<p>“It really shook me to my core and made me think about ‘what is feminism all about?’ and ‘who is it for?’ and ‘what are the limits of a certain feminism and how do we have to push it forward?’” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>She said she has struggled to assert both her feminist and her Jewish identity due to the popular notion that they are at odds.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to be accepted as what a certain image of what a feminist was and in some sense a certain aesthetic of what a cool dyke was in that moment of the early 90s,” Cohen said. “In some sense I wanted to go underground as a religious person because I couldn’t feel the two together.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she uses “feminine God-language” in order to unravel the core of many patriarchal religious interpretations.</p>\n<p>“If our images in terms of the ultimate power of the universe and the language we use is only male … it becomes enshrined,” she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Evelyn Cabral said she strongly agreed with everything the panel members said during the event.</p>\n<p>“Everything to do with feminism and religion is a choice, and the intersectionality between the two of them and the parallels between the two to them,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Cabral said she chose to attend the event because it brought together “two good parts” of her life, referring to religion and feminism.</p>\n<p>“Usually it is hard to find events that bring these two parts of your life together. It’s usually either religion or feminism. It’s never both of them together, so that’s why I wanted to come to this event,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Mariam Tariq, second-year global studies and political science double major, said as a Muslim feminist she related to many of the experiences the panel discussed.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been feeling a lot of conflict about what is a woman’s role within religion,” Tariq said. “This event seemed like a good way to listen to scholars and hear what they have to say, and I thought it was really enlightening and it was a reaffirmation of everything that I believe and it’s amazing to see other women of different faiths also struggling with the same issues.”</p>\n<p>Tariq said she would like to see more events that combine feminism and faith, which are usually kept in different spheres on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think religion on campus is sort of a touchy subject. Not many people bring it up and there’s very limited spaces where you can bring it up,” Tariq said. “I don’t see this much on campus where you get to see women fighting as feminists and for their religions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/","id":2548,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2547,2546,2545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former Student Arrested in 2014 Campus Rape Case","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?resize=417%2C519&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara Police arrested one man Wednesday in connection with the February 2014 violent rape and assault of a UCSB student.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68090\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68090\" data-attachment-id=\"68090\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/daniel-j-chen-ucpd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?fit=417%2C519&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"417,519\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daniel J.

Chen, 21, of San Ramon, Calif., was arrested by UCSB Police Wednesday and charged with four felonies: rape by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury; rape in cooperation with another person; battery; and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Chen is being held in Santa Barbara County Jail without bail. He was arrested in Alameda County in January on an unrelated felony charge, according to the press release, and his DNA was matched to DNA from the crime scene, next to UCSB’s track.</p>\n<p>Chen’s Facebook profile says he graduated from Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, Calif. in 2012. Chen attended UCSB from September 2012 to December 2013, according to UCPD.</p>\n<p>The female victim was raped and assaulted by three men in the early hours of Feb. 23, 2014, after being taken from Isla Vista to a secluded location next to UCSB’s track. Shortly after the incident, UCPD <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\">released a sketch</a> of two of the three suspects, depicting two Asian men.</p>\n<p>The victim of the crime filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/\">lawsuit</a> against the University of California in January alleging that the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\">area of the attack was not properly maintained</a> by the university, UCSB’s Police Department had not properly investigated the case and that UCSB “skewed” its sexual assault figures to attract prospective students.</p>\n<p>In January, Tyrone Maho, an attorney for the victim, told the <em>Daily Nexus</em> he hoped the lawsuit would reinvigorate the university’s investigation into the assault.</p>\n<p>“Our hope with this whole thing is not only to draw attention to what the university did to basically allow this activity to take place … but also to help with the appeal to find the perpetrators because it has been two years and UC police have not found the suspects,” Maho said in January.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, Department of Justice Crime Lab and the FBI assisted in Chen’s arrest.</p>\n<p>Chen will appear in Santa Barbara Superior Court on Feb. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p>Approximately 50 students discussed the meaning and future implications of environmental racism and environmental justice at an event titled “What is Environmental Racism?” on Monday in the MultiCultural Center.</p>\n<p>The event was presented by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E), the Human Rights Board and the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB). Attendees discussed environmental and social realities of incidents such as the Flint water crisis in Michigan, mining on Native American reservations, the I-710 corridor project and the Marcopper Mining Disaster in 1996.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, EAB environmental justice chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, began the discussion by defining white supremacy and institutionalized racism.</p>\n<p>“White supremacy is an ideology in which white people or people of European descent are believed to be inherently better over people of color,” Mitchell said. “And it is institutionalized because different institutions uphold that power dynamic, so it is a disproportionate amount of power in certain communities and a lack thereof in others. When you link that system with the system of capitalism you get things like environmental racism.”</p>\n<p>Unique Vance, S.C.O.R.E. co-chair and third-year global studies major, gave an example of environmental racism.</p>\n<p>“One definition is the placement of low income or minority communities in proximity of environmentally hazardous or degraded environments,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said environmental injustice is not just exploitation of the earth and its resources, but of people as well.</p>\n<p>“It is not only that these human beings have to deal with all of this pollution, but we have to think about the flora and the fauna that is being impacted by those polluting sites,” Mitchell said. “Without exploiting land and people at the same time, capitalism, and therefore profit, cannot exist.”</p>\n<p>Vance said government institutions, either intentionally or unintentionally, often ignore toxic waste and pollution, as in the case of Flint, Michigan where the water source from Lake Huron was switched to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready.</p>\n<p>Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive, causing public outcry over the lack of response by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.</p>\n<p>“The government was well aware of the consequences of lead,” Mitchell said. “Lead is a known neurotoxin to human beings.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said it is nearly impossible for Flint residents to sell their homes, a struggle that was recently chronicled in <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/many-flint-residents-are-desperate-to-leave-but-see-no-escape.html\">The New York Times</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Monaé Orange, third-year black studies and sociology double major, attended the event and said Flint residents are still paying full price for the contaminated water.</p>\n<p>“They are still forced to pay their water bills and they are refusing to refund them for any of that,” Orange said.</p>\n<p>Vance said the people least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it.</p>\n<p>“The modern day environmental justice movement sprouted from some really amazing activists and people who were sick and tired of their communities being targeted by the state for environmental issues,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, S.C.O.R.E co-chair and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double major, said he and others are in the process of creating an environmental justice minor for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We are planning on creating an environmental justice minor at UCSB,” Kris said. “Future first and second-years, probably third-years too, keep an eye out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Hodges, the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB professor of philosophy Dr. Quentin Gee argued the deeper issues of same-sex marriage, such as religion, the definition of marriage and social equality.</p>\n<p>Gee, who advocated in favor of the recent ruling, said marriage is an institution that is constantly changing and should be open to all couples.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that is generally defined by the society that we live in, and it changes,” Gee said. “The civil institution of marriage has undergone a number of transformational shifts. People should come to realize that the civil institution of marriage is something that should be expanded to same-sex couples.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the idea of marriage is not a “biological feature of humans,” but rather dynamic and culturally constructed.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that humans together collectively define in a particular way,” Gee said. “We’re expanding this notion that marriage is this idea of freedom of the individual to choose these relationships of mutual support between two people.”</p>\n<p>Gee said marriage is a “social institution” and focused his argument on the idea that marriage is not strictly for procreational purposes.</p>\n<p>“We’re changing our conception of marriage,” Gee said. “The conception of marriage has changed to what we might call a companionate sense. When you marry somebody, you are taking on an additional life partner, a companion.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, religion cannot be used as a legitimate excuse to refuse same-sex marriage and said if it is used, it is on the basis of discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s no clear reason to exclude same-sex couples [from marriage]. They can offer elements of companionship,” Gee said. “I don’t see any real, compelling reason, and if there is no compelling reason, it’s seems to be more or less a prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Gee said while religion is important to society, it cannot be used to enforce a law that denies rights to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p>“You cannot use religious reasons to justify or create social institutions or social contracts in ways to suit your religious needs,” Gee said. “Everyone ought to respect religion and appreciate the things it brings to our lives, but at the same time, we cannot impose it. And laws impose.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, there is no valid reason to deny same-sex couples the right to wed in any state, and said he believes religion cannot justify the rejection of their marriage.</p>\n<p>“There really isn’t a clear, justifiable reason to limit [marriage] to between a man and a woman alone,” Gee said. “I would say that you cannot use religious motivations for limiting the institution of marriage to simply a man and a woman.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Ryan T. Anderson, opponent to the Supreme Court ruling, said he supports a “conjugal vision of marriage” which presents men and women as pairs to unite as one person.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is primarily a comprehensive union of sexual complementary spouses where man and a woman unite as one flesh,” Anderson said. “The act that makes them one flesh has the capacity to create new life, and that relationship of husband and wife has the capacity to create a child with both a mother and a father.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, since the U.S. Constitution does not mention what concept of marriage is correct, it is up to citizens to create laws on how marriages should be governed.</p>\n<p>“The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is silent to which one of those visions is true or good or the best,” Anderson said. “And where the Constitution is silent, we the people retain constitutional authority to make laws.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the flaw in the Supreme Court ruling was that it bypassed constitutional laws by enacting its own opinion on the nation.</p>\n<p>“It imposed that philosophy of marriage on the entire nation under the guise of constitutional law,” Anderson said. “There is no constitutional justification whatsoever by five unelected judges to say, ‘our preferred philosophy of marriage is now required of all fifty states simply because of our fiat.’”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, the Supreme Court violated the Constitution and said this should be a concern for all informed Americans.</p>\n<p>If you care about constitutional, democratic self-governance, you have to care about the judicial usurpation of politics, which is what took place in Obergefell,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Anderson disputed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s reasoning for the ruling and said the future of marriage will constantly be changed to suit different needs.</p>\n<p>“If you think about the actual arguments that Justice Kennedy made to justify his philosophy of marriage, and simply think though, what does it mean for the future of marriage? It means that marriage will simply be redefined as contract law,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, Justice Kennedy’s ruling will cause marriage to be continuously redefined in the future.</p>\n<p>“What’s the legal principle for monogamy?” Anderson said. “What prevents future redefinitions of marriage?”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the Obergefell ruling has already affected religiously based businesses and charity organizations that refuse to support the new law.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already seen in jurisdictions where marriages have been redefined where faith-based adoption agencies have been shut down, where schools are beginning to lose their accreditation,” Anderson said. “We’ve seen bakers, florists, photographers penalized not because they said they refuse to serve gay people; their only objection was to baking the same-sex wedding cake or doing the alter flowers for a same-sex marriage.”</p>\n<p>Anderson told the story of a florist who refused to create an arrangement for a same-sex wedding. The women was sued by her state, lost the first round of her legal battles and has appealed to an appellate court.</p>\n<p>“She should have a constitutional right after Obergefell not to be forced to violate her beliefs,” Anderson said. “The Supreme Court says same-sex couple have a right to get marriage, but that doesn’t place a duty upon anyone else to help celebrate that way.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said he hopes there will be a way to discuss the issue and reach a conclusion in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“How do we agree to disagree about marriage without persecuting one another, without using the government as a blunt force to impose our values on others?” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and psychology double major Iridian Magallon said before the debate, she was interested to see how Anderson would argue against same-sex marriage without relying on religion.</p>\n<p>“I was really curious as to what the arguments [Anderson] would propose, because I always thought the main argument against same sex marriage was religion,” Magallon said. “So I was curious how he was going to argue without using religion.”</p>\n<p>Magallon said she was surprised that Anderson argued his opinion well, but ultimately agreed with Professor Gee.</p>\n<p>“It was interesting that he was able to argue that side pretty well,” Magallon said. “[In the end], I was still on [Gee’s] side.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics and accounting major Andrew Gates, the Supreme Court ruling was unconstitutional and denied state’s rights.</p>\n<p>“The decision of Obergefell was an issue of state’s rights, and I do believe the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial fiat or judicial activism, in that they were not concerned about what the Constitution said about marriage, but rather what they believed,” Gates said. “The issue is that do the states have the right to choose should same-sex marriage be allowed, and I fully believe they should.”</p>\n<p>Gates said he was originally opposed to the Obergefell ruling and believes the Supreme Court was not justified in its action because the federal government involved itself in a state issue.</p>\n<p>“I was against the Supreme Court ruling, and I’m still against it,” Gates said. “Personally, I don’t have any problem with the state legalizing same sex marriage, but the issue is, ‘do you believe in self-governance in a constitutional republic?’ If you do, you would recognize the state right to define marriage is the state’s right, and the federal government should not interfere.”</p><div

The Nexus interviewed some highly rated instructors to see what they think about the website.</p>\n<p>Communication professor Desiree Aldeis, who scores a 4.9, said she feels the website is a helpful tool for students, provided they “take it with a grain of salt” and remember the evaluations are subjective.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a useful tool that students can utilize to make better choices and more informed choices for the classes that they sign up for,” Aldeis said. “And I think students are also aware that these are their peer’s opinions and their peer’s experiences might be different from their own.”</p>\n<p>Aldeis said that the website is also useful to professors so that they can see what aspects of their teaching style are and aren’t working for students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that professors get on there and read what their students say about them because there may be some things that you don’t know you’re doing that are not working well for your audience,” Aldeis said. “I feel like it’s a lot of information for us as professors in terms of how we can maybe improve or even the things we can continue to keep doing.”</p>\n<p>German professor Evelyn Reder, who also scores a 4.9, said students should avoid choosing courses based on the subjective reviews of others.</p>\n<p>“There must be some truth to it, but you also don’t know — it’s so individual and so subjective,” Reder said. “To be sure, you have to try them out, you can’t really base it on someone else’s judgment, so it’s probably not the best way of picking a class.”</p>\n<p>Reder also said the website tends to only attract students with very extreme opinions.</p>\n<p>“I kind of feel from what I’ve seen that only students that really love you or really hate you will write a review and everybody in the middle kind of doesn’t really bother,” Reder said. “I try to do my best, I try to really take my students’ voices into account and try to be there for them, but I think in every class you have students that love you and students that don’t like you so much.”</p>\n<p>Emma Levine, a graduate student studying music, is a teaching assistant with a perfect five rating on the site. She said students should be wary of personal evaluations, because students may form strong opinions about professors based on little experience.</p>\n<p>“I did find as an undergrad that it’s useful so students can report on things like here’s how many tests there are, how many quizzes or papers or how the class is run,” Levine said. “As far as kind of personal evaluations, it’s sort of hit or miss — you can get a student who just has one very strange interaction with the professor and then just hates them forever.”</p>\n<p>That said, Levine said a teacher can make or break a class.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a TA for music appreciation class here. I’ve also taught the class, and depending on who’s teaching it, it’s a completely different class,” Levine said. “I think if you have a really great teacher, it almost doesn’t matter what they’re teaching, it’s going to be a good class.”</p>\n<p>While some student’s opinions may not be representative, Aldeis said, evaluations with a number of negative comments are often accurate.</p>\n<p>“It may be the case that one student had a very negative experience so they use that platform to vocalize it or voice their frustrations and things like that,” Aldeis said. “But … when you read multiple comments and they’re all saying the same thing, more or less, or have the same kind of theme to each one of them, then I don’t think that’s a sign of unfairness or inaccuracy. If anything I think that’s something that students should really consider.”</p>\n<p>Eric Engel, a chemistry tutor with Campus Learning Assistance Services (C.L.A.S.), has a 4.9 rating and criticized the website’s “easiness” rating.</p>\n<p>“With teachers being rated on easiness, I think that’s kind of a reflection of students not taking classes seriously or not really knowing that being forced to work is going to help them,” Engel said. “Maybe they’re seeing classes as a hurdle or obstacle to take to get to their degree and not really appreciating the benefit of hard work.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Britteny Young said she may look for a high “easiness” rating when choosing general education or prerequisite classes but would not do the same for classes within her major.</p>\n<p>“I’m a psych major, so math isn’t really my thing, so if I can find a teacher that’s reported to be easy then, yeah,” Young said. “But for my major requirements, I don’t think that’s a positive cause I’m paying for it, so might as well get the best.”</p>\n<p>Young said that overall she feels like RateMyProfessor.com evaluations are generally accurate and are useful for both students and professors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” Young said. “Obviously there’s extreme responses from people — either you loved it or you hated it — but I think overall you get a really good feel for the class. I think it’s good for teachers to look at it — sometimes they can be in their own worlds.”</p>\n<p>Rubí Rodríguez, a fourth-year political science major, said she would never use the website because she wants to form her own opinions.</p>\n<p>“If it works, it works, but I’ve never used it or thought about using it just because I don’t like to have or be stopped from taking a class or professor because the ratings are wrong,” Rodríguez said. “That way, I can choose for myself and not come out with an idea that doesn’t necessarily apply to me.”</p>\n<p>Rodríguez said that choosing a professor based on easiness also sometimes makes sense, because students have to consider how their choices will affect their GPA.</p>\n<p>“I think as a college student, what you want is to succeed,” Rodriguez said. “And I think with easiness you think ‘Ok I can excel. I can raise that GPA and fulfil this credit.’”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

and UCSB alumnus, and Natan Sharansky, author, activist and chair of The Jewish Agency, discussed their relationships with Judaism, anti-Semitism, activism and religious pluralism Wednesday in Pollock Theater.</p>\n<p>The event was part of a three-part university tour titled “Jewish Journeys,” which began Thursday at Brown University and stopped at Stanford University before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Both Sharansky and Douglas became active in the Jewish community after their childhoods.</p>\n<p>“I grew up knowing zero about my Jewish-ness,” Sharansky said of growing up in Soviet-ruled Donetsk, Ukraine. He said he knew his family was Jewish only because it was “written on the I.D. of your parents” and because of “all the conversations about anti-Semitism and discrimination.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said being a Jew at the time was like being “born with some very rare disease,” and the only “medicine” was being the best at your trade.</p>\n<p>“Your parents are telling to you, because you are Jewish, everywhere — in school, in university, in kindergarten — you must be number one,” Sharansky said. “In physics or mathematics or in chess or in music or in dance, whatever, it doesn’t matter, you must be the best at your profession. That is the way how we Jews survive.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said many Jewish people felt a sense of community after the Six-Day War of 1967 — when Israel gained the upper hand against the Soviet Union and its Egyptian and Syrian allies —leading to increased activism among Jews.</p>\n<p>After the war in 1967, Sharansky said, “Israel entered our lives very powerfully because the victory of Israel over allies of the Soviet Union was a huge humiliation for the Soviet Union.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said, following the Six-Day War, he realized the importance of his connection to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, you find out, you discover that all the people around you, your friends and your enemies, they all connect you to the Israeli army,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said after his son’s bar mitzvah, his family visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after which the Genesis Prize Foundation recognized his commitment to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“A few pictures were taken; it made the Israeli press,” Douglas said. “The next thing I know, the Genesis group contacts me and presents this incredible prize, this opportunity which I was truly touched because I felt I was part of a tribe.”</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Israeli government opened a permanent egalitarian prayer space earlier this week at the Western Wall.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where Jews are coming for 3,000 years to talk to God and at the same time; it is the number-one national symbol,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Sharansky said years of negotiations have resulted in the understanding that even though some compromises regarding the Wall may be painful, the unity of Jewish people is more important.</p>\n<p>“For me, it is very important that we as a Jewish community always will be open and welcoming for those who are invested,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Jewish people have reason to be optimistic about their history and the future.</p>\n<p>“It is a sense of community, and I have been deeply inspired by my son and by my father,” Douglas said. “So I see and feel a continuity of generations, a sense of immortality. I am hopeful and optimistic.”</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A segment of the event, April Savage, third-year biology major, asked about interfaith climates on college campuses. Douglas responded by encouraging discussion of controversial subjects.</p>\n<p>“People always say, ‘don’t talk about politics or religion and you will always get along.’ I would encourage a dialogue and being able to open up and expose yourself and have the support of Hillel behind you,” Douglas said, referring to the Jewish nonprofit student group.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said UCSB has more Jewish undergraduate students than any other UC campus and that 160 students traveled to Israel on birthright trips last year.</p>\n<p>Andrew Packer, third-year economics and accounting major, described his experience with Santa Barbara Hillel and his birthright experience.</p>\n<p>“For me, Santa Barbara Hillel has enabled me to reconnect with my Jewish roots,” Packer said. “It allows me to continue my cultural exploration of Judaism and opens the dialogue on religion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67943\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67943\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/","id":2543,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2542,2541,2540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"D.R.E.A.M.

Loan Program will provide undocumented UC students with federal financial aid for the first time. <em>Photo Courtesy of CaliforniaStateGearUp.org</em></p></div>\n<p>The University of California is rolling out its D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program this academic year, providing an initial $5 million in federal aid to undocumented students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The aid will be distributed to 3,000 undocumented students and will include more than approximately $350,000 to UCSB students. The money comes equally from the California state general fund, and UC funds and will be distributed to campuses based on need.</p>\n<p>Habiba Simjee, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator at UCSB and Undocumented Legal Services Counsel, said the program was a significant step toward addressing the financial struggles of undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is an important step in addressing the significant funding gap for undocumented students who wish to pursue their education at UC schools,” Simjee said. “It’s been very challenging and heartbreaking to hear from students who have to withdraw or drop out because they’re unable to make ends meet, particularly when we consider the cost of living in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Michael Miller, director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UCSB, said the goal of the program is to make education more affordable for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The goal of all financial aid funding is to ensure access and affordability for all UCSB students,” Miller said. “This loan program will be one more resource our D.R.E.A.M. Scholars have available to them, and, given the work and loan commitment all UCSB students assume while they are here, it is going to play a huge part in their ability to finance their education.”</p>\n<p>The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program, proposed by UC President Janet Napolitano, was passed in 2014, but funding was not available for students until the current academic school year. Miller said the program helps level the playing field.</p>\n<p>“The creation of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is a big step forward for D.R.E.A.M. Scholars across California, and it gets us closer to making sure they have the same resources available to them that other students have,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller also made it clear that the University can do more for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of our campus, because our student leaders pushed for this program and their hard work paid off,” Miller said. “This program is a step in the right direction, but we still have a lot of work to do.”</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, said the program will help ease the financial burdens facing the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“The overall goal of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is to help undocumented students who have limited financial options afford a UC education,” Doan said. “It helps alleviate the burden for undocumented UCSB students, many of whom are often forced to take semesters off or take outside jobs to offset the cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, the average UCSB student graduates with about $21,000 in student loan debt.</p>\n<p>“Student loans are widely used by students to pay for education-related expense like tuition and fees, room and board and books and supplies,” Miller said. “The D.R.E.A.M. Loan program will help eligible students meet these expenses.”</p>\n<p>Under current laws, undocumented students who graduate from high schools in California can apply for state and university aid, but their status as undocumented students prevents them from obtaining federal aid.</p>\n<p>Ricardo Leon, second-year computer engineering major, said he expects the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program will help offset the lack of federal funding.</p>\n<p>“The program will help [undocumented students] because they’re not eligible for federal aid, so they don’t get the Cal Grant, and they also can’t get loans through the federal government,” Leon said. “Having the government give them some loan money would be really helpful.”</p>\n<p>Leon said the program would help undocumented students focus more on their education and less on their finances.</p>\n<p>“A lot of undocumented students have to get jobs in order to get that extra funding and make ends meet,” Leon said. “I think a loan would help them focus more on their studies.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previously, UCSB students held a sit-in to establish a more concrete policy in regard to sexual violence procedures and policies. Though this policy has been implemented and revised, a meeting was held on Wednesday to consider how recent changes will affect the student body and student access to support programs. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, staff and administrators met in the UCen’s Santa Barbara Harbor Room on Wednesday to discuss recent changes to how UCSB will respond to reports of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The group focused on evaluating the recently implemented UC-wide Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and how it will affect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming began the discussion by explaining the purpose of the meeting.</p>\n<p>“Our goal from the staff side of things is just to make sure that we have an opportunity for regular communication, that we have an opportunity to sit down and hear from you about your ideas and thoughts on things, if there are concerns you think we need to beware of,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Fleming said under UC policy, each campus has some freedom to determine implementation procedures.</p>\n<p>“That is actually something we have more control over are our own campus procedures, so we can go back, look at that and amend that,” Fleming said. “The policy is the policy for now. It has been embedded, system-wide it has been approved, it has been implemented as of Jan. 4, so we don’t have the ability to make any changes to the policy, but we do have the ability to make changes to the way we describe the implementation procedures, and we can clarify things that aren’t clear.”</p>\n<p>Briana Conway, victim advocacy specialist for C.A.R.E. Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct program at UCSB, said the policy is clear for reports of a student perpetrator, but other procedures need further specification.</p>\n<p>“I think phase two of that and ongoing will be really fleshing out what are the procedures when any one party is a non-affiliate and how do we work through next steps and action items as far as recording for that,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, vice president for Committees and Planning of the Graduate Students Association, said a flow chart for procedures on student reports could be useful.</p>\n<p>“If that could be adopted here and accessible, but accessible without students having to go into C.A.R.E., so on a website or something, so if something has happened they don’t necessarily have to go in and consult with someone to get clarity on what the process might look like. I think that would be great,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Irvine said websites explaining the procedures can potentially be difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>“Certainly if you know how to navigate these things, you can find what to do depending on what your situation is, and if you go to C.A.R.E., it is really easy to report and call C.A.R.E. and go into C.A.R.E., but that is not necessarily what everyone wants to do.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Perkin, assistant dean for student life at the Office of Judicial Affairs, said the C.A.R.E. Advocate Office is preparing a one-page document to distribute to students.</p>\n<p>“We are working on a summary and overview one-page document on this process, so that is something that could just be handed out,” Perkin said. “Then we were thinking about, on the back, putting the flow chart.”</p>\n<p>Conway said there should be a balance of transparency and privacy in the reporting and advocacy processes.</p>\n<p>“What is that happy medium? We can put it all out there for transparency, and, yes, I fully support that. But I don‘t want it to ever lose the beautiful bond that an advocate can provide and help a survivor navigate their options,” Conway said. “That is the core value of why I wake up every morning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

to residence halls involved in the festivities. The Marathon will start the evening of Feb. 20, running all night. <em>Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Dance Marathon will host UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon from Feb. 20 to 21 to raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon is one of the nation’s largest collegiate philanthropy organizations and operates through the Children’s Miracle Network (CMN) and fundraises year-round to provide care for children at each campus’ local CMN hospital. This year, UCSB will be raising money for Cottage Children’s Hospital located in Santa Barbara, CA.</p>\n<p>Samantha Gerraty, second-year dance and biology double major and co-director of Dance Marathon operations, said Dance Marathon began at Indiana University in honor of 18 year-old Ryan White, who passed away from HIV/AIDS in 1991.</p>\n<p>“White was diagnosed with HIV/AIDs, and passed away from the disease before he could attend college,” Gerraty said in an email. “[White’s] friends held a dance marathon, which fundraised for the Riley Hospital for Children, and inspired other students across the nation to start supporting their own local CMN hospitals.”</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, fourth-year biology major and Dance Marathon executive director, said the organization hopes to raise even more funds than last year.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to raise a lot of money for Cottage Children’s Medical Center. We are hoping to outdo last year where we raised $35,000,” Padlipsky said in an email. “We are also hoping everyone comes to the event excited and leaves inspired.”</p>\n<p>Padlipsky said the Dance Marathon club at UCSB has focused on getting everyone on campus involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“The organization of the club has changed a bit, and this year we are really focusing on getting all clubs, Greek life and residence halls to participate so all of UCSB is represented,” Padlipsky said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gerraty said participants will be able to meet past recipients of the money raised through Dance Marathon and enjoy games, food and performances by UCSB student groups.</p>\n<p>“At the event, the dancers will have the opportunity to meet five miracle families — children and their families who have been helped by Cottage Children’s Medical Centre — to hear their stories and to play games and dance with them,” Gerraty said in an email. Desirae Lucas, fourth-year psychology major, said she chose to be involved in the marathon this year because she enjoys dancing and supports the event’s charity.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to participate in Dance Marathon this year for a few reasons — the first is because I love to dance and it would be a fun time to spend with all of my friends,” Lucas said. “Second, I think it’s for an amazing cause, and lastly, I also wanted to do it this year because I wasn’t able to make it last year because I got sick.”</p>\n<p>Lucas said she plans to wear comfortable shoes and to dance for the entire 12-hour event.</p>\n<p>“My strategies to survive are bringing very comfy shoes and to just keep dancing — the more you dance, the less time you’ll have to worry about your feet starting to hurt!” Lucas said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico, first-year undeclared major, said she is excited about the challenge of dancing for 12 hours continuously.</p>\n<p>“I’m most looking forward to showing off my dope dance moves while spending time with great people to support the children,” Dycaico said. “I’m also excited to see how people’s dancing changes as we approach hour 12. Maybe I’ll even challenge a few people to a dance battle.”</p>\n<p>Dycaico said she plans to prepare for the marathon by sleeping well the night before and pacing herself throughout the marathon.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to sleep a full 12 hours the night before, eat food, drink water and pace myself throughout the marathon by saving my best moves for the very end,” Dycaico said. “Plus, I’m going to start training for Dance Marathon by playing a random song on Pandora and having a mini dance party in my dorm every night for the week leading up to dance marathon.”</p>\n<p>To register

the sixth president of Pitzer College this summer and the first African American to ever be appointed president of one of the five undergraduate colleges of the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>Oliver has served more than thirty years in the University of California, first as a professor of sociology at UCLA and then as the dean of social sciences at UCSB beginning in 2008. Throughout his career, Oliver strove to create opportunities for minorities in UC, co-founding the UCLA Center for Study of Urban Poverty, and overseeing the creation of Chican@ studies, feminist studies and global studies Ph.D. programs during his tenure at UCSB. Before coming to UCSB, Oliver served as Vice-President of the Asset Building and Community Development Program at the Ford Foundation, where he developed a grant program to provide 35,000 low-wealth households with secure home mortgages and to change the way banks assess home mortgage applicants.</p>\n<p>Oliver has received multiple distinguished awards and fellowships in recognition of his work in higher education and philanthropy, including the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, National Science Foundation Research Initiation Planning Grant and more than $5 million in research support from NSF, Ford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Haynes, and the Social Science Research Council. During his time at UCLA, he was named the California Professor of the Year for his “extraordinary dedication to teaching and commitment to students.”</p>\n<p>Having earned his bachelor of arts at William Penn College in 1972, Oliver said he is both elated and honored to have been named president of an institution like Pitzer, which has “all of the characteristics of a great liberal arts college” that he admires.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to go back to my roots,” Oliver said. “The liberal arts was a transformative experience for me … it was the kind of place that encouraged my creativity, it was the kind of place that nurtured my intellectual curiosity and it gave me leadership opportunities to grow and develop.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said his appointment as the first African American president of an undergraduate Claremont college motivates him to create “ladders of opportunity” for those who come from backgrounds similar to his own.</p>\n<p>“In a lot of things I’ve done I’ve been the first. The first only means that you have to create the ladders of opportunity for other to follow. It’s not about you, it’s about what you can do for others,” Oliver said. “I see it as one of my responsibilities to create those ladders of opportunity so other students of color, other professors of color, other really disadvantaged folks can also have the same opportunities I’ve had.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said he was attracted to Pitzer because it reflects his own values, such as commitment to diversity, environmental sustainability and education geared toward social impact.</p>\n<p>“Those are all values that I’ve promoted in my life, into my work, and I think Pitzer is the kind of place I can go to and help them double down on some of those concerns they have — some of those issues that they’re grappling with,” Oliver said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Pitzer is fortunate to have Oliver, as he is a “seasoned administrator” who possesses unique leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“His vision and leadership have shaped the academic profile of social sciences at UC Santa Barbara, and he has been exemplary in advancing our commitment to diversity among students, faculty, and staff,” Yang said in an email. “Dean Oliver’s upcoming departure is a bittersweet moment for our university. We are immensely proud of his success, yet we regret losing a dear colleague and friend.”</p>\n<p>Donald Gould, a Pitzer trustee and head of the presidential search committee, said it took nearly a year to systematically narrow down the approximately 300 applicants, before the Pitzer board of trustees selected from among the final candidates. The board valued Oliver’s administrative and teaching background, as well as his time outside of the academic world, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>“The board has to select the individual that they feel in all respects, including temperament, experience, judgment, is the best person for the job, and I think that all of those things together led to our putting Melvin Oliver at the top of our list,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Gould said the board took note of Oliver’s “heart for undergraduate education” and the impact of his own liberal arts educational experience as transformative.</p>\n<p>“Even within the large university settings at UCLA and UCSB he’s always been a champion of liberal arts education,” Gould said. “So certainly it will be a different environment than the large University of California environment, but we think that the things he’s learned in the UC system can only be beneficial to us.”</p>\n<p>On a broader stage, Oliver said he aims to promote the liberal arts educational environment as one that prepares students for the future.</p>\n<p>“We sometimes push for our students to be concerned with that first job out of college. We bemoan that the liberal arts isn’t allowing people to have those $100,000 a year jobs,” Oliver said. “But what we do create in the liberal arts are people who can be engaged citizens … We’re not about the first job, we’re about the last job. We’re about what you’re going to grow into.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said while he is leaving the UC system, he is hopeful both the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown will continue to recognize the importance of investing in the UC.</p>\n<p>“The University of California, even with its problems, is still the most important mobility ladder for the state of California,” Oliver said. “The UC will continue to be the leader in doing that and I just hope that they can see the value in investing in UC. When we invest in UC, we invest in the future.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/","id":2567,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2566,2565,2564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Finance and Business Committee Fully Funds Nine Requests, Partially Grants Six, Tables Three, Denies One","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FinBo_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FinBo_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee (A.S.
