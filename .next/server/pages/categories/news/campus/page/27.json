Food Co-op, the Transfer Student Center and Associated Students Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“We love working with our campus and community partners because they all bring their unique ideas, strengths and expertise to the table,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>In Fall Quarter 2018, over 530 students attended FNBS events, Ovalle said.</p>\n<p>“Every quarter we put on approximately two workshops per week,” Ovalle said. “[These workshops] help improve food security on campus through education but more specifically through helping promote healthy food, easy access, educational content to increase food security and teaching skills.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the new hands-on cooking classes, FNBS will continue to offer a variety of nutrition and wellness-related programs, including garden and grocery tours as well as cooking demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Garden tours teach students how to plant seeds to grow their own vegetables and herbs. Similarly, FNBS hosts tours of the I.V. Food Co-op, in which students learn about unit pricing, using coupons and shopping in bulk.</p>\n<p>Approximately 48 percent of the university’s undergraduate students experience some degree of food insecurity, according to a University of California Global Food Initiative report from Dec. 2017.</p>\n<p>“Cooking doesn’t need to be expensive, and it doesn’t need to be complex,” Ovalle said. “Cooking can save you tons of money, it can be a whole lot healthier and it can be a lot of fun.”</p>\n<p>Student can sign up for workshops <a href=\"http://wellness.sa.ucsb.edu/fnbs\">here</a>. Sign-ups for Winter Quarter 2018 are not available as of Dec. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

The UCen Governance Board will hear presentations from various businesses and ultimately vote on which one to rent to.</p>\n<p>The board will put together a Request for Proposal (RFP), in which they will “choose a specific type of business that [they] want to go after” or leave options more open-ended, Lawrence said.</p>\n<p>The space is unusual in that it does not have a kitchen and instead has a classroom. Before Kaplan occupied it, the space was filled by various travel agencies.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very weird space,” Rose Ettleson, undergraduate representative on the board, said. “I can’t even think off the top of my head who to occupy that space.”</p>\n<p>Ettleson, a fourth-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major, expressed concerns about the possibility of UCPD filling the space.</p>\n<p>“As undergraduate students on this campus, police presence is something that is not always welcomed,” she said, noting that the UCPD inquiry was still in the “very beginning stages.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously I don’t want there to be just one option unless it really seems like a good option.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson said in an email that if they were to secure the space, it would primarily be used for “community policing and [a] Community Service Officer (CSO) station.”</p>\n<p>Currently, UCPD’s station is a 20-minute walk from the center of campus.</p>\n<p>“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts.”</p>\n<p>Olson said the appeal of the space is its central location on campus and its proximity to other campus organizations and entities.</p>\n<p>While UCPD has not submitted a formal proposal, Olson listed the task as a priority for 2019, along with identifying a source of funding if UCPD is chosen.</p>\n<p>The space does not have a fixed rent, Lawrence said, although Kaplan paid approximately $8.50 per square foot.</p>\n<p>For now, the campus bookstore will use the space at the beginning of Winter Quarter for the book reservation program that they typically hold in the lobby.</p>\n<p>Lawrence hopes the board can find an entity to fill the space as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“We just would like to find somebody who’s willing to pay the most rent possible,” he joked.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

now, Sorin would have an advisory role in the process, while Interim Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor would have the final say on who UCSB’s representative is.</p>\n<p>By boycotting, Sorin will refuse to take part in the selection process for a new representative.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the association as a whole will not recognize any new board members until the board “acknowledges some structural changes need to be made and begin the process of making them,” said Raphael Chinchilla, GSA vice president for academic affairs.</p>\n<p>Selvidge resigned from her position as UCSB’s graduate student representative on the Title IX student advisory board in November following <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">disagreements</a> with the UC Office of the President (UCOP).</p>\n<p>These disagreements arose after the Nexus reported on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/\">Selvidge’s interpretation</a> of the new Title IX policy changes.</p>\n<p>She resigned a few days later, drafting a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Selvidge-Title-IX-Student-Advisory-Boar...signation-Letter-11-2-18-Google-Docs.pdf\">lengthy resignation letter</a> and releasing it to the public by way of the nowUCSB Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also spoke heavily during Tuesday’s meeting, speaking to both her experience on the Title IX board as well as why she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, this is sort of a free speech issue,” Selvidge said. “If we cannot appoint our own independent representative… we can’t be certain that we’re actually going to get a representative who truly represents the graduate population, and that is concerning.”</p>\n<p>Sorin added to Selvidge’s points, claiming the board and UCOP have tried “to bully us into compliance with them, which I’m super not fucking down with.”</p>\n<p>“From our perspective and what happened with Jenny, [the Title IX Student Advisory Board] not only does not welcome dissent, but has actively tried to crush it,” Sorin said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you do not agree with what the Office of the President’s perspective is on the Title IX policy, and you are vocal about that, you will be removed.”</p>\n<p>The board, which was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">created in Nov. 2017</a>, aims to help clarify Title IX policies for students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The board’s current head is Taylor, who took over following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">resignation</a> of previous coordinator Kathleen Salvaty.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now the only UC without any representation on the board. UCSB has not had a say in board decisions for almost a month.</p>\n<p>“The university is continuing its search for UCSB representatives to serve on the Student Advisory Board,” Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Taylor forwarded the <em>Nexus</em>‘ request for comment to Doan.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 12]: The vote passed with one abstention, not zero.

SB 320 would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer medication abortion services by Jan. 1, 2022.</p>\n<p>However, Governor Jerry Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-30/governor-brown-vetoes-abortion-pill-bill/\">vetoed Senate Bill 320</a> on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>This new bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB24\">Senate Bill 24</a> – colloquially known as the “College Student Right to Access Act” – would require public universities with on-campus student health centers to provide medication abortion to students who seek to terminate their pregnancy during the first 10 weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is critically important that we reaffirm the constitutional right of college students to access abortion care without delay, and that should always include student health centers on public university campuses,” Levya said in a press release sent out on Dec. 3.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of where they may live, Californians should have access to the full range and choices of reproductive care services so that they can plan their futures and accomplish their goals.”</p>\n<p>Research shows medication abortion has a success rate of over 95 percent, according to the press release. Serious adverse events occur in only 0.3 percent of instances.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/\"><em>Nexus</em> previously reported</a> that the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 confirming the Mifeprex pill, a hormonal pill used for medical abortions, is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>SB 24 is sponsored by the Women’s Foundation of California, ACLU California and Students United for Reproductive Justice at UC Berkeley, among others, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“I am confident that the incoming Legislature will also approve SB 24 and that Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom will continue to stand strong in his support for a woman’s right to choose,” Levya said.</p>\n<p>SB 24 will be “considered in Senate policy committee(s) later this spring,” according to the press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-85195\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The subcommittee met last Tuesday at the Engineering and Science building at UCSB. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representing the subcommittee was chairman Kevin McCarty, California State Assembly member Monique Limón and California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</p>\n<p>Panelists, students and faculty members from UCSB discussed a variety of topics ranging from building maintenance to Pell Grants in an effort to spotlight current and future problems within the University of California system.</p>\n<p>Among the panelists were Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Lisa Przekop, director of the Office of Admissions at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, addressed the assembly with concerns about the current state of the school’s physics program.</p>\n<p>There has not been a “permanent increase” in facility space for the physics department since 1994, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>He cited a shortage of space for students majoring in physics despite a 300 percent increase in the number of physics students since 2006.</p>\n<p>Haines proposed UCSB construct a new physics building, which would encompass 125,000 square feet of space and cost $165 million. According to the meeting agenda, a source of funding has not been verified.</p>\n<p>Across campus, the most recent classroom building was constructed in 1967, but the school has recently received preliminary project approval from the UC Regents to construct a new building, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>In addition to core funding, campus revenue will also be used to develop the building, which will hold 2,300 new classroom seats, he said.</p>\n<p>Housing has also become a primary concern for the campus as the increase in residents exceeded the school’s intended capacity by about 1,200 students, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>The university plans to make space for 5,000 more beds by 2025 as part of their Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>Currently, 1,500 of the 5,000 beds have already been constructed through the development of the San Joaquin and Sierra Madre living spaces, Haines said.</p>\n<p>To fulfill the remainder of the LRDP plan, Haines proposed renovating existing housing sites such as Storke Apartments and the Channel Islands residence halls “to increase density and build additional housing.”</p>\n<p>For the development of faculty housing, UCSB has taken a different route.</p>\n<p>The college plans to narrow Ocean Road, leaving more room for the development of roughly 540 residential faculty units, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Not only will this bring faculty housing closer to campus, but Haines hopes that it will also bring a faculty presence to Isla Vista, attracting different businesses to the area and bringing steady activity to businesses during the summer and holiday seasons.</p>\n<p>The school plans to carry out this project through a third-party developer, which Haines believes they will begin to look for sometime in 2019.</p>\n<p>Campus buildings — many of which are “at the end of their useful life” — are requiring more money and maintenance over time, Haines said.</p>\n<p>The effects of old equipment spill over to laboratories as well, forcing faculty members to work with old equipment that does not always support their research. This is known to stifle UCSB’s faculty recruitment process, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>Haines noted that the school has used one-time state funds to fix critical building system problems in the past, but options are running out as “the backlogs are significant and the problems are growing larger.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85196\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85196\" data-attachment-id=\"85196\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-02/assembly-budget-subcommittee-discusses-current-needs-and-future-changes/sanya-kamidi_budget-meeting_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanya Kamidi_Budget Meeting_ONLINE (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C661&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85196\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C661\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85196\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As the discussion turned to funding, local assemblymember Monique Limón asked the panel how they plan to prepare for the next recession.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, executive director of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, explained that he and Haines are cautious about putting money into “permanent obligations.”</p>\n<p>Shumaker added that UCSB has been “frugal” about its staffing in an attempt to do “more with less.” UCSB’s concern with the success of its programs and which programs will receive funding in the future is an example of this practice, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Non-academic services, also known as auxiliaries, have been noted to provide the university with sizable additional revenue, he said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker also recommended the university “look at philanthropy and grow that side of the campus to create revenue,” as this can help fill the holes caused by previous recessions in 2008 and 2012.</p>\n<p>Limón explained that as a higher education facility, UC and CSU campuses do not receive funding from Proposition 98, which provides funding for California Community Colleges. This lack of annual funding poses further challenges in the way of sourcing revenue.</p>\n<p>Another concern regarding enrollment is attracting out-of-state and international students. Haines said he believes the price of tuition is not competitively priced, comparable to that of Ivy League universities.</p>\n<p>Out-of-state tuition practices, such as the school’s refusal to give financial aid to residents outside California, diminishes its demand from an out-of-state perspective, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Przekop added that many schools aiming to recruit California residents offer scholarships that UCSB cannot match.</p>\n<p>Concerns are different for in-state students, according to California Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, who serves as the chair of the committee. The average yearly rate for room and board at UC Santa Barbara is $15,273.</p>\n<p>But room and board, unlike tuition, is not covered with money from traditional Pell Grants or UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plans, forcing roughly 40 percent of the student body living in residence halls to either find applicable scholarships or take out loans.</p>\n<p>These loans incur an average of $20,000 to $30,000 of debt following graduation, according to McCarty.</p>\n<p>Recently, UCSB has ramped up efforts to support its students during economic hardships and times of distress, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>For example, UCSB has developed meal, grocery store and housing voucher programs; a financial crisis response team; a food boarding program to help students cook communally; and a CalFresh campaign, which registered roughly 3,000 students and brought $5 million worth of resources to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>With many projects and policies set for implementation in the coming years, the potential effects on the campus and its community are still unknown, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Chancellor Yang remains optimistic.</p>\n<p>“We must not compromise the qualities of education and diversity,” Yang said during the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I’ve experienced all sorts of people.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen, a third-year history major, is a part of Mock Trial at UCSB and Vice President of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity. He said he has no declared conflicts of interest, as he had joined Mock Trial after Kopel left.</p>\n<p>“When I was growing up, I talked a lot. The only thing my mom told me to do was go into law,” Nguyen said, “[during high school] I was in Mock Trial, Model UN … I love the judicial process.”</p>\n<p>“I am really good at working with people; I’d like to think that I’m a people person… I believe I have a strong work ethic.”</p>\n<p>Marron, a fourth-year political science and communications double major, said she also has no conflicts of interest. Along with Nguyen, she is part of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen what the school is, especially what the students kind of want, as well,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked closely with the student body… I’ve been on the student faculty committee for about two years now and work in the Office of Judicial Affairs, so I see the administrative side and the student side, as well.”</p>\n<p>Nilsen, a third-year computer science major, previously worked as a solicitor general for the A.S. attorney general’s office.

Are we going to burn?’”</p>\n<p>Tamara was rerouted to the long road out of Magalia toward Chico, which took her approximately three and a half hours.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85122\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1289994422\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85119\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85122\" data-attachment-id=\"85122\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/camp-fire-leaves-ucsb-students-hometown-destroyed/online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1143&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1143\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C507&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85122\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3-1024x585.jpg?resize=888%2C507\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85122\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Butson family</em></p></div>\n<p>For those three and a half hours, Mikala heard nothing.</p>\n<p>“The route that they took up through the mountains has no reception,” she said. “The last time I had gotten a text was ‘We’re evacuating, do you want me to grab you anything?’ and then I didn’t hear from them for like four hours.”</p>\n<p>With both misinformation and a general lack of information coursing through social media during the early hours, Mikala was left to wonder if her family had been lost to the flames.</p>\n<p>“I wish I was there to help my mom, get stuff out of the house and help her evacuate and be there for them,” she said. “But I was all the way here. I felt kind of hopeless.”</p>\n<p>Residents driving out of Paradise and Magalia on the main road, the Skyway, found themselves <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/10/this-is-when-i-die-unforgettable-tales-of-escape-from-the-camp-fire/?utm_content=tw-mercnews&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social\">trapped </a>as the flames licked their cars, killing a number of residents.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Magalia altered the roads in its downtown to be more reminiscent of an old town, like Truckee, Calif., Tamara said.</p>\n<p>But that meant converting two of the four lanes into parking — two lanes that were unavailable for residents as they attempted to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“Everybody was kind of freaking out, going ‘How did this happen? How did we get all these billions of dollars to change this road?’” Tamara said. “‘We need the access, because if there’s a fire, where are we going to go?’”</p>\n<p>“And so, sure enough, a fire happened and everybody was like ‘Why did they do this? It’s like they meant to kill us or something.’”</p>\n<p>The lack of official communication, coupled with the minimal evacuation routes, meant many residents died in their homes.</p>\n<p>“We’re on an emergency system. They’ve been preparing us for a couple years. Like, ‘If there’s an emergency, we’re gonna call everybody reverse 911,” Tamara said. “We all felt pretty comfortable, like they’re going to call us for any emergency. Nobody knew anything, and it was early in the morning, you know, people were still sleeping. And that’s how come a lot of people died in their homes and in their cars. It was horrifying. It was horrible.”</p>\n<p>“We felt so forgotten, so alone.”</p>\n<p>The Butsons’ house is still standing after the fire.</p>\n<p>“Our house is pretty smoke damaged inside,” Tamara said. “We have soil outside that’s toxic, and the insurance is going to give us no money. They’re only going to bring in cleaners and have them clean.”</p>\n<p>If Tamara feels that the cleaning job is not satisfactory and there are still leftover toxins, she then has to pay for tests to measure the toxicity, which cost anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000, according to Tamara.</p>\n<p>“I can’t go back to my house; there’s no way I can live in toxicity,” Tamara said. “My house should’ve burned down because if it would’ve burned down, I at least could’ve had money to then take it and then pay off the bank and then start again.”</p>\n<p>“But it didn’t, so I’m one of the unlucky ones.”</p>\n<p>Tamara, Mikala and Nick moved to Paradise when Mikala was three years old, and eventually moved to Magalia, the neighboring town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“It’s difficult to say I enjoyed growing up there,” Mikala said. “My mom had only just been able to get a job that was higher-paying. None of the people around me had a lot.”</p>\n<p>Butte County is one of the poorest counties in California, Tamara added.</p>\n<p>“People literally … the seniors, the disabled, the single moms, they absolutely have no money. I’m fortunate. I feel fortunate. I came with nothing, but I feel fortunate,” Tamara said.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 17, President Trump visited Butte County alongside Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>\n<p>“When he was giving his speech, [Trump] couldn’t even remember the name of Paradise. He called it ‘Pleasure,’” Mikala said. “His response has not been supportive.”</p>\n<p>“He has basically said it was our fault … that we should’ve raked our leaves, we should’ve done these small things,” she added. “He’s denying any bigger issue of climate change or any bigger issue of PG&amp;E being the cause of it.”</p>\n<p>Mikala spoke about the political attitudes of Butte County and Paradise more specifically. Although the area is mostly conservative, many Trump supporters questioned Trump’s response to the Camp Fire, according to Mikala.</p>\n<p>However, she doesn’t believe political opinions have substantially changed after the fire.</p>\n<p>“It’s very red, and, basically, the opinions reflect that.”</p>\n<p>There is one common sentiment on the ground: <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/09/pge-power-lines-may-have-sparked-deadly-butte-county-wildfire-according-to-radio-transmissions/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)</a> is to blame, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Months ago, Mikala and her family got a notice in the mail from PG&amp;E which indicated that when there is high fire danger, PG&amp;E would shut off the power.</p>\n<p>A couple of days before the fire, PG&amp;E reported that there would be high winds and therefore the power would be shut off, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>“They had never shut off the power, even though they told us they were going to,” she said. Then, the fire happened.</p>\n<p>“There are already people who are starting the lawsuits against them and like getting legal teams together,” Mikala added. “I’ve seen hundreds of people talk about it online. If they find out that’s what caused it, it’s going to be a huge thing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-paradise-fire-lawsuit-1542165733-htmlstory.html\"><i>The Los Angeles Times</i> reported</a> that people who lost homes in the Camp Fire have, in fact, already begun suing PG&amp;E.</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, PG&amp;E “did not maintain its infrastructure and failed to properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines,” the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reported.</p>\n<p>In the days since Tamara and Nick left Magalia, they traveled to Santa Barbara to stay with Mikala in her one-bedroom apartment, which is “paid for entirely by financial aid and loans from the school,” Mikala wrote on the family’s <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/butson-family-camp-fire-fund?fbclid=IwAR0Lkse9VxkxeRzEuh4HMqnqfMJqLXW9R9ffpXboxChCWDuZqxBiK18nmQM\">GoFundMe</a> page.</p>\n<p>After staying with Mikala for about a week and a half, the two found an apartment in Solvang, which they were able to furnish with two beds and a few household items with money from the GoFundMe.</p>\n<p>Mikala signed them up for Adopt a Family, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/paradisefireadoptafamily/?ref=group_header\">Facebook group</a> to connect those affected by the Camp Fire and those who want to help. The person who has ‘adopted’ Tamara’s family has been sending them items every day from their Amazon Wish List, including a coloring book to help Tamara de-stress.</p>\n<p>But what comes next?</p>\n<p>“Wow,” Tamara exhaled.</p>\n<p>A heavy pause followed.</p>\n<p>“You know, I’m freaking out right now. I loved my job. I finally had a job that I was doing so well financially, and I had it planned out. I was paying off things, I was going to save. I had enough for taxes. I was feeling good about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>For now, Tamara sees herself putting down roots in Solvang, close to her daughter.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a really hard time having my family apart,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mikala, who will be graduating this spring, is looking to get a full-time position at the UCSB Library, where she currently works part-time.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to go to graduate school, but I was going to take the year off. But now, maybe I should just go on for financial purposes instead of taking the year,” she said.</p>\n<p>The family doesn’t see a future for them in their hometown.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Paradise and Magalia] are going to rebuild, and if [they do], it’s going to be many, many, many years because it’s just so devastated,” Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Tamara and her son will be in Solvang for at least the next year.</p>\n<p>“[Nick] was here awhile back and loved Solvang, and he told me many many months ago that if there’s anywhere he wanted to live, it would be Solvang,” she said. “So, I said, ‘That’s where we’re going to live,’ and here we are.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The Public and Mental Health Commission was approved for $26,000 for this year, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>“Around $10,000 is specifically for the Mental Health Conference,” he said. The rest of the money would be allocated toward honoraria, marketing and projects.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Mental Health Planning Committee, an independent entity, has planned the annual Mental Health Conference. This year, the Public and Mental Health Commission plans on helping the committee.</p>\n<p>The executive board of the Public and Mental Health Commission will have a conference coordinator position dedicated to Mental Health Conference planning, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>The executive board will also include co-chairs, policy analysts, a mental health special projects coordinator, a public health special projects coordinator, a nontraditional first generation representative, an event/program director, a QTPOC representative, a financial coordinator and a marketing outreach director among others.</p>\n<p>Kaayal plans to be one of the co-chairs alongside Bongi Makatini, a fourth-year biological sciences major and Spanish minor.</p>\n<p>Makatini reached out to Kaayal after seeing the work he was doing regarding mental and public health. After the resolution passed in March 2018, Kaayal and Makatini came together during Spring Quarter 2018 and worked on the commission over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to step on the toes of the great work that’s already been done on campus, but we really wanted to see A.S. taking more of a stand to try to help tackle different issues regarding mental health here on campus,” Makatini said.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Committees already approved Kaayal and Makatini for the co-chair positions and submitted the two appointments to A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>Kopel has sent those appointments to A.S. Senate, and A.S. Senate now must vote in favor of the appointments. The Senate must also approve all other executive board appointments.</p>\n<p>Even though the executive board has yet to be approved, Kaayal and Makatini have started planning prospective projects.</p>\n<p>One of the projects involves free flu shots for UCSB students, according to Kaayal. The project would be funded by the commission.</p>\n<p>“We’re also working with student health and library administration and custodial services to start placing hand sanitizer dispensers around campus,” Kaayal said.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to target the library first and then hopefully branch that out to the UCen and lecture halls.”</p>\n<p>Makatini mentioned the toll the quarter system takes on the mental health of UCSB students, and how students who never had mental health problems prior to college “all of a sudden have anxiety or depression or any other mental health disorders.”</p>\n<p>“We really want to make sure that students have a central voice through Associated Students to be able to utilize these different resources,” Makatini said.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

resolution, authored by Senator Zion Solomon and seconded by Senator Christian Ornelas, also called for the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to reject any and all future oil drilling proposals in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“I’m bringing this issue to Senate because I believe Associated Students can be used as an important platform to use to lobby legislatures [sic] within the community,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>This project includes three separate oil drilling proposals in the Cat Canyon Oil Field, located in northern Santa Barbara county near Santa Maria.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/WestCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, from the Texas-based ERG Operating Company, would add new injection wells, drilling pads and processing facilities, as well as expand current pads.</p>\n<p>In the second <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/AERAEastCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, the Shell and ExxonMobil company AERA would drill new oil wells via “steam fracking.”</p>\n<p>The third <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/PetroRockUCCB.asp#documents\">proposal</a> by PetroRock would also add new steam injection wells.</p>\n<p>In total, the project would add more than 750 new intensive oil wells in Cat Canyon, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/fighting-fracking-and-extreme-oil\">according</a> to the Santa Barbara chapter of the Sierra Club.</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls on both Associated Students (A.S.) Senate members and Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs) with environmental mission statements — including the Environmental Affairs Board, Human Rights Board and Coastal Fund — to write letters to the Board of Supervisors declaring their opposition.</p>\n<p>The resolution also asks Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “reaffirm his previous commitments against fossil fuels” by issuing a statement against the project.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] will both pressure our elected officials on a bigger scale and give environmental lobbyists more weight when they’re talking to the Board of Directors making this decision,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, the resolution’s student sponsors — fourth-year environmental studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major Amanda Pantoja and second-year computer science major Dylan Kupsh — both emphasized the importance of students speaking out and signing petitions against the proposals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the supervisors got in because of student efforts, so we want them to hear what we have to say,” Pantoja said. “UCSB itself is one of the greenest campuses. I want to ensure we reflect our green values in the community.”</p>\n<p>Pantoja pointed out during the meeting that the Cat Canyon Proposals contradict California State Senate bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">100</a>, which puts California on the path for 100 percent fossil fuel-free electricity by 2045.</p>\n<p>“Going with these projects would go against what Santa Barbara and Goleta have voted for,” she added.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will vote on these measures in early 2019, according to Kupsh. Currently, the supervisors are editing proposed Final Environmental Impact Reports.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

response to a lot of questions that people had [regarding the union strikes],” Isabella Liu, vice director and head of publicity USAS, said.</p>\n<p>“We just wanted to educate people and give them a space to communicate and open up dialogue where dialogue hasn’t been opened.”</p>\n<p>In October, several hundred UC workers went on their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-23/afscme-begins-second-strike-of-the-year/\">second strike of the year</a>. The workers, represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), protested low wages and job outsourcing, among other issues.</p>\n<p>AFSCME is the the largest union of UC employees in California.</p>\n<p>Juan Donato, a lead groundskeeper who has worked at UCSB for 35 years, spoke during the panel about the strikes and working at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He said he found the AFSCME union to be a channel through which his voice could be heard.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, UCSB is a public school, so we get to ask questions,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, when I ask questions myself, it doesn’t work. I get muted. But together with the union, we are strong. With the union, I have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Anna Fabian, a fourth-year AFSCME intern, spoke of learning about the labor movement as she went through her four years at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Coming to UCSB, I didn’t know much about the labor movement and I didn’t know about the hypocrisy that happens here,” Fabian said. “We learn so much in our classes about the mistreatment of workers, but it’s happening right outside our classrooms.”</p>\n<p>“After you learn so much about what is happening, you can’t just turn around and not do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>One-fifth of UC workers have faced discrimination in the workplace based on their cultural background, one-third reported not being paid overtime and one-half reported being overworked, according to a survey conducted by USAS.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the majority of workers reported not being paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>AFSCME members said during the panel they will continue to push for change, despite the fact that no changes came out of the October strikes.</p>\n<p>“We may not be able to see the results in our time, but it’s the legacy that I want to leave,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>“For my children, for the children of my grandchildren — in the long term, it is going to be worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-85022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrisse Cullors spoke at UCSB on Nov. 15. <em>Katelyn Zamudio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, put on by the UCSB MultiCultural Center (MCC), has been in the making for nearly nine months, according to MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>“[Cullors’] voice and the message she gives is so powerful. We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

We make mistakes and we own up to them. We issue corrections when needed and we are open, time and time again, as to how our reporting process works.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> has a duty to the student body to keep them informed of relevant issues in their community. We also do our best as student journalists to hold elected officials accountable.</p>\n<p>We feel the need to write this editorial because the Associated Students (A.S.) 69th Senate is not doing that for themselves.</p>\n<p>The Senate has a duty to the student body to represent students’ issues, one they have not maintained since taking office.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Nexus’</em> point of view – as individuals who extensively cover Senate’s resolutions, meetings and more – the 69th Senate consistently fails to represent our student body and is, in no way, accountable to the people they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is a group of 24 students who decide how millions of dollars of our student fees are spent. The senators are paid $350 a quarter in honorarium and are required to fulfill specific duties, such as holding office hours.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Senate as a whole lacks transparency. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senate did not have a public list of their office hours until the <em>Nexus</em> requested it during Week 6. The 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code mandates this list be “scheduled and publicly posted by the end of the third (3rd) week of each quarter.”</li>\n<li>They use Facebook to communicate Senate-related announcements to their constituents, despite the fact that you need to have a Facebook account and be Facebook friends with them to see anything remotely related to their positions.</li>\n<li>They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the <em>Nexus</em> created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.</li>\n<li>They demanded The Bottom Line (TBL) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which TBL – and the <em>Nexus</em> – had every right to record.</li>\n<li>Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senators are not holding themselves accountable; instead, they consistently act unprofessionally as elected officials who control millions of dollars in student fees.</p>\n<p>We do want to acknowledge the valuable work some senators have been doing. For example, Senator Zion Solomon has worked to compile finance reports that detail the amount of money allocated to organizations during Finance and Business Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>To our knowledge, the finance reports are only posted on Facebook, but Senator Solomon’s efforts show a commitment to transparency.</p>\n<p>Senators do good things. We’re not saying they don’t. However, many of them have not been doing the jobs they have been elected to do.</p>\n<p>Even the leader of Senate – Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho, whose pay amounts to $3,000 a quarter – fails to take his job seriously.</p>\n<p>His job is to hold his senators accountable, to keep some semblance of decorum during Senate meetings and to ensure senators follow Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Ho fails to show professionalism, even during Senate meetings. Ho, as the IVP, sets the tone for how senators should conduct themselves during meetings.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46381421_335573963663022_3500040927651561472_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1279546202\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">retweeted</a> a tweet from Senate minute-taker Isabella Liu, which stated “someone get me out of this meeting please.” Ho replied to the tweet at 7:26 p.m. with “someone save us please.”</p>\n<p>Later during that same meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://46498938_2203294369732002_1446147155357073408_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1131452933\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">tweeted</a> “this meeting has been going on in circles, I wish I could get a proxy.”</p>\n<p>Both Twitter accounts are public.</p>\n<p>What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, a UCSB alumnus stood up at public forum, identifying themselves as a “concerned Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you one simple sentence, and I’m not taking any questions, but I recently realized that the <em>Daily Nexus</em> is really good for toilet paper and I want to recommend it to all of you. It’s really good to wipe your ass with,” the individual said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just trash, garbage newspaper so please use it to wipe your butthole with whenever you’re taking a shit, that’s my recommendation.”</p>\n<p>His words are what spurred this editorial, but they are not the focus of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we would like to call attention to the way the senators and proxies, as well as Ho, responded to this individual.</p>\n<p>In response to this individual’s words, senators and proxies laughed and clapped their hands over their mouths. One even bowed toward the podium as the individual walked away.</p>\n<p>Ho could be seen recording the individual and laughing. The video <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9540.TRIM_.mov\">was posted</a> on Ho’s Snapchat story with the caption “I have no words 4 dis.”</p>\n<p>The comments from “concerned Gaucho” were not said in order to provide constructive dialogue or a call to action. Rather, they were blatantly inflammatory and used to reap attention.</p>\n<p>A few members of A.S. spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> following these remarks, condemning the sentiments. Yet no one publicly addressed the individual’s comments for the rest of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are not required to defend the <em>Nexus</em>, but there are standards they must adhere to.</p>\n<p>According to their own 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code, members of A.S. must “treat each other and those in the community with behavior that fosters a safe, inclusive environment for everyone. This behavior includes but is not limited to: professionalism, compassion, courtesy, civility, and respect.”</p>\n<p>We would have hoped senators would have acted in accordance to their Legal Code, as their response to “concerned Gaucho”’s remarks was not professional, compassionate, courteous, civil or respectful.</p>\n<p>Instead, our paid, elected officials laughed at the hateful comments.</p>\n<p>They did not keep composure – they joined in on the joke.</p>\n<p>This is a student government, and we are a student newspaper. To the world outside our university, it is easy to dismiss our student government’s actions as an inconsequential side effect of decisions made by 18 to 22-year-olds.</p>\n<p>However, these people are our future “real-world” leaders. From what we have observed so far, there is a dangerous precedent in motion.</p>\n<p>Maybe we’re asking for too much. But we certainly hope that’s not the case.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-84938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikicommons</p></div>\n<p>According to CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, the Arbor is the first store on the UCSB campus at which students can use CalFresh.</p>\n<p>CalFresh, also known as the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.), gives eligible individuals electronically distributed monetary benefits every month which can be spent at specified local markets or grocery stores, according to the official website of the California Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p>The website also states that participants of the program are administered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Cards which they can use to purchase food items at stores that accept CalFresh.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB, we estimate that about 10,000 students are eligible for CalFresh, and if you’re eligible, you may get up to $192 a month,” Melissa Fontaine, the food security coordinator at UCSB, said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016-17 academic school year, the UCSB CalFresh Team enrolled roughly 600 students in CalFresh, and 3,000 students in the following year, according to Fontaine.</p>\n<p>This year the CalFresh team hopes to enroll 6,000 students in the program by the end of Spring Quarter, Fontaine said.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor happened largely because the UCSB Sustainability Program saw student need for more affordable food options.</p>\n<p>UCSB CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, a fourth-year psychology major, echoed this sentiment both as a representative of CalFresh and a participant in the program.</p>\n<p>“I actually grew up with food stamps, so I’m very familiar with the CalFresh program,” Perez said. “Without food stamps, I don’t think my family would’ve gotten through, especially since I come from a low-income household.”</p>\n<p>Now, as a UCSB student, Perez notes that CalFresh provides a new mobility and convenience to students that may not have been able to afford grabbing a quick snack in between classes at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>“Especially during midterms or maybe finals or maybe throughout the day, students sometimes don’t have time to go grocery shopping or don’t have time to go get a snack at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Christian Ortiz Gonzalez, a fifth-year sociology and german studies major, was also heavily involved in bringing CalFresh to the school.</p>\n<p>“I decided to work on getting EBT accepted at UCSB because I saw a dire need for it,” Ortiz Gonzalez said in an email to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Ortiz Gonzalez said he worked with several UCSB administrators and staff to help implement the program on campus.</p>\n<p>The new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor also follows a recent shift in the on-campus stigma surrounding the CalFresh program, which resulted from effective tabling and campaigning on the part of the CalFresh team, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“I think now, to be honest, UCSB has normalized what CalFresh is…I’ve heard a lot of people say, ‘Hey, how have do you not have CalFresh,’ like ‘You need to get on CalFresh.’”</p>\n<p>Fontaine stated she wanted to wait until the Arbor staff was fully trained on how to properly process CalFresh payments before making a public announcement about CalFresh’s availability.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for the Arbor that their systems and staff are ready to go before students come to start spending their EBT CalFresh cards here at the Arbor because we want to make sure that everyone has a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Now that CalFresh is available at the Arbor, Perez hopes the program will spread to other markets and food stores on campus.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the spread of the program will “benefit both students and stores.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s say our school year last year ended with about 3,000 students who were eligible [for CalFresh] and they were getting $120 a month [through the CalFresh program],” she said. “That becomes $360,000 that could be spent, and is likely to be spent, in the local community. And over the course of the year, that’s over four million dollars.”</p>\n<p>“That would benefit business like the Arbor, Tenaya Market, the Isla Vista Food Co-op… Their sales will increase because students now have more purchasing power, so that’s tremendous.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 15, 2018, print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 2, 2019]: This article was updated to include information about Gonzalez. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84937\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84937\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/","id":2193,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2192,2191,2190],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari Admits to Living Off Campus, In Violation of Legal Code","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/yasamins.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/yasamins.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Salari, a second-year pre-political science major, spoke Wednesday night regarding rumors about her living situation.

She confirmed she is living off campus rather than on campus.</p>\n<p>As an on-campus senator, Salari is required to “live amongst [her] constituents during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters of their year of elective service,” according to Article II Section 1(B)(4) of the Associated Students (A.S.) legal code.</p>\n<p>Salari said she intended to live on campus when she ran for the position, but cited financial burdens as the reason she was unable to.</p>\n<p>“I am an on-campus senator, and I know a lot of people are, I guess, upset about the fact that I’m living off campus,” Salari said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“When I got elected for it, and because of some financial issues, I wasn’t able to [live on campus]. As many of you know, living on campus is more expensive.”</p>\n<p>She said she would be “more than happy” to privately discuss further details about her financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari ran on a platform of reinforcing UCSB’s student health care system, citing early closing hours and the lack of an urgent care system.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi sent out an email to all senators to discuss Salari’s standing.</p>\n<p>Safadi said A.S. Elections Board initially approached Salari to ask about her living situation after they had received a complaint, to which she “did not provide a conclusive answer.”</p>\n<p>“There was no prior indication to Senate as a whole that Yasamin was in financial burden and thus Yasamin was not transparent about this situation; with that, there was an active effort to conceal,” Safadi said in the email.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore, the initial refusal to answer questions about her living situation solidifies the lack of transparency, and thus indicates her acknowledgement of violating the rule and the subsequent concealment of the violation.”</p>\n<p>Safadi added that “concealing the truth about not living among your representative constituents is a direct violation of [A.S.] Legal Code.”</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Senate voted to give Salari a one-time exception with the stipulation that her living situation would be later discussed within the A.S. Internal Committee.</p>\n<p>Several senators also discussed permanently changing legal codes to allow for future exceptions. There was no motion made regarding legal code changes.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 16]: Salari did not specify the exact location of where she is living, only stating she is living off campus. That information was obtained from the email from A.G. and has been removed from this article at Salari’s request. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
