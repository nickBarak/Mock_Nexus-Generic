Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S. Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, titled “A Resolution To Abandon the European Traditions Requirement,” was authored by Off-Campus Senators Kimia Hadidi and Adalis Rojas and passed at the Feb. 19 Senate meeting. However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

400;\">initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows students from any college or university with a summer job or internship in the Santa Barbara area to stay in UCSB-owned housing for the summer. The initiative was created in response to similar programs at other UC schools, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley, according to Whitney Morris, director of Conference and Hospitality Services at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We noticed that [the program] was very successful [at other UC schools],” Morris said, “and that it was definitely fitting a need for students in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because subletting apartments or houses over the summer in the Santa Barbara area can be expensive for students, Morris said she and her colleagues wanted to create an affordable alternative for college students interning in the area, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled at UCSB. The San Joaquin Villages were </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/freshman-summer-start-program-fssp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously used</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for summer camps and programs, such as for parents staying overnight for their child’s freshman orientation, and will continue to house students and parents for summer programs alongside the new intern housing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the summer Intern Housing program would live in the apartments for a 30-day minimum at a cost of $35 per night, or $1,050 a month, for a double room or $55 per night, or $1,650 a month, for a single room, according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the summer Intern Housing program has one applicants and has 107 bed spaces to fill, Morris said. Participants must be at least 18 years old and provide proof of enrollment in a college or university. The program is also open to UCSB students working on campus during the summer. The application for the program opened on Feb. 3 and will close at 12 p.m. on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Joaquin Villages, </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hdae-building-development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built in 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences/san-joaquin-villages\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s newest housing complex</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The San Joaquin Villages were built as a part of the university’s </span><a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Range Development Plan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an initiative to increase UCSB’s enrollment by one percent each year until 2025. The plan seeks to accommodate a total of 5,000 additional students and provide housing for all of them. The San Joaquin Villages feature 165 apartments and can house approximately 1,000 residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complex was chosen for the program because of its amenities, which include a pool and volleyball courts, and its short distance to the dining options available in Isla Vista and Goleta, Morris said. She added that the apartment style of the housing would also be “great in terms of promoting communities.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/20/2020, 7:45 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the San Joaquin Villages were previously used to house parents and their children for summer programs.

id=\"caption-attachment-92890\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the stations is to provide hungry students with a quick snack during the middle of their days. </span><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Promise Scholar Program is comprised of 500 students who are a part of underrepresented and low-income groups and who have an average family income of $25,000, according to Program Director Holly Roose. Students who qualify for the program are promised an estimated $120,000 in financial aid over four years if they remain Cal Grant or Pell Grant eligible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose said that the goal of the stations is to provide students who are hungry with a quick snack during the middle of their days, with options such as granola bars, trail mix, fig bars and fruit snacks, and to supply menstrual products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the frustrations that motivated this project was that in order to get into the dining commons and access the [A.S.] Food Bank, you need to have a student ID, and our [Promise Scholar] kids often lose their IDs so $35 is a lot of money to replace it,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stations have been placed in 10 locations on campus, including the Transfer Student Center, Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success Student Center, UCSB Student Health, the MultiCultural Center, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, El Centro, College of Letters and Sciences Advising in Cheadle Hall, the Athletics Department, the Educational Opportunity Program and the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose explained that the new project was funded by the California government, which allocated around $80,000. The grant is designated to be spent by June and will be a contender for renewal if the project succeeds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students with a heavy academic workload, sitting down for a meal during the day is not always feasible. Fifth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major and Promise Scholar Sami Kaayal said the conveniently placed snacks have helped him stay fueled during busy days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a decent chunk of those snacks throughout the week can help me whether I’m rushing to class and I don’t have time to eat breakfast … or just as supplemental snacks throughout the day between classes,” Kaayal said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Promise Scholars Program represents low-income students, Roose explained that the healthy snacks and menstrual products are available to all students on campus, regardless of income. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Promise Scholars Program deals with very low-income students, but the middle-class students fall through the cracks on this campus as well,” Roose said. “They don’t get financial aid but they can’t necessarily pay for college either so some of the middle-class students are even needier sometimes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, I just want hungry students to get food and proper sanitary products.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aniket Mehrotra</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributed reporting. </span></em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

Organizers are planning to take a vote next Monday to potentially go on strike at UCSB, if UCSC graduate students are dismissed from teaching positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an informal poll about the possibility of striking at UCSB with 595 responses, 63% of graduate students who responded said they were “willing to pursue” a full strike if UCSC dismisses graduate student strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin noted during the meeting that these numbers are greater than ones from initial strike polls at UCSC prior to the beginning of their strike, and that more than a quarter of the entire graduate student population had responded to the poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA organizers said in the meeting that they plan to send out another poll next week to graduate students to assess support of a grading strike or full teaching strike and will meet again on Monday evening for COLA General Assembly.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her discussion, titled “From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment,” challenged the audience to expand their personal definitions of gender-based violence and emphasized the structural change required to transform the culture around sexual harassment and violence across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s Feminist Futures Initiative, which brings together UC Santa Barbara faculty, students and outside speakers to collaborate on interdisciplinary research on gender justice, hosted the event alongside the UCSB Women’s Center and local businesswoman Sara Miller McCune. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the afternoon, Hill met with over 30 high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, some of whom are engaged with researching sexual harassment on campus, according to Professor Leila Rupp, associate dean of social sciences, who introduced Hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of the students this afternoon were even born when Dr. Hill gave her courageous and world-altering testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Rupp said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also spoke at UCSB in 1995, and at the beginning of her speech noted that, after 25 years, it is “hard to imagine we are still in the struggle together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that it’s been a while since 1991. Some of you are probably wondering, ‘Why didn’t you wear that green suit?’ and some of you are probably wondering, ‘Oh, when’s she gonna start dishing the dirt on the senators?’” she joked to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill did not dwell on her own experiences in the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead focused her speech on the work that still remains after the launch of the #MeToo movement, which reignited the conversation about accountability of those in powerful positions regarding sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill noted that her own experiences in the Senate parallel that of Christine Blasey Ford, who in 2017 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to understand that what happened to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should never happen again, but we also have to recognize that it is happening every day to somebody in this country,” Hill told the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that outrage over the Kavanaugh confirmation changed the course of the 2018 midterm election, but that the response from the federal government since then has been lacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No robust government response to gender-based violence has occurred and in this primary cycle, little or no attention has been given to what many call a moment of reckoning that happened back in 2017,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of conversation around sexual violence, Hill said, includes current 2020 Democratic primary candidates, who participated in a debate in Nevada on the night of Hill’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are in another debate tonight and if the history proves to be a reflection of what’s going to happen in the future, those questions are not going to be had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill challenged the audience to expand the way they view gender justice to include not only sexual harassment, but sexual assault, domestic violence, rape and incest. To fully understand the problem of gender-based violence, Hill said that society needs to examine the “bigger picture” of how survivors are treated beyond the specifics of their own experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can relate to the individual stories, but it is just as important for us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solutions have to be multi-dimensional because the impacts of gender-based violence are multi-dimensional. It impacts [people’s] ability in many cases, depending on the nature of the problem, to have housing, to be educated, to live safely in their communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that the U.S. government has “taken on huge social problems,” such as the opioid crisis, by addressing the problem as a matter of public safety, and that the same approach needs to be taken to address gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill said that this can’t be left to the government to solve alone, that individuals need to also view gender-based violence as a matter of public safety and “problem solve as a community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we really believe that abuse that affects one person affects us all? Do we really believe that we are all in this? I’m not sure we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One structural change Hill proposed to address gender-based violence is to challenge how society as a whole approaches masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This idea of manliness is curated to make us believe that to be a man you must be emotionally restrained, strong and brave, aggressive and awesome,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That] is not masculinity, it is abuse.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also elaborated on what she said is the systematic practice of silencing people who choose to come forward with stories of gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believing women to be truthful is consistent with fairness and justice,” she said. “Now all of you believe that, right?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cheers and applause from the audience, she continued, “We are now in a time where if we say we believe survivors, we are met with the claim that we are denying due process. In other words, due process has been weaponized to silence survivors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do not support a system that presumes every time a woman testifies about abuse, she is lying. But that is what many of us start with: that she cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” Hill emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill’s testimony against Thomas in 1991 raised complicated questions about the intersectionality of race and gender, she said. Opponents criticized Hill for coming forward, saying she “did a disservice to the Black community by testifying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those critics, Hill asked for the trust that she believes all survivors deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, Hill spoke with UCSB feminist studies graduate students Amoni Thompson and Megan Spencer, answering their questions about her career and life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to a question from Spencer about solidarity with student movements, Hill expressed her support for UC graduate students calling for a cost-of-living adjustment, a movement known as COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Affordable housing is an issue for everyone,” Hill said to audience applause. “Unfortunately, most families have to fight that issue on their own, but our students should not have to fight this battle on their own. Universities should be using their resources to help them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill left the audience with a challenge: No matter how difficult it may be to fully change the culture around gender-based violence, she said, it is just as important now as it was when she first spoke to the Senate in 1991 to fight for structural change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is natural to revert back to the status quo. It’s inevitable. But the problem is so severe, we cannot afford to do that.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The trip is described on the Hillel </span><a href=\"https://santabarbarahillel.wufoo.com/forms/perspectives-with-sb-hillel-application-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an almost free “life-changing trip to explore Israel and the Palestinian Authority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will bring UCSB undergraduate student leaders together to learn about inter-group and interpersonal relations. Along the way, we will explore Israeli society, Palestinian society, and the conflict in the region,” the application for the trip reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the application page, the Santa Barbara Hillel, which is located in Isla Vista, says students will, among other things, “[hear] multiple narratives from a wide variety of speakers and guests, including religious, secular, Druze, Christian, Jewish-Israeli, Palestinian, and Muslim voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition lays out several reasons why Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is opposed to the trip, building upon a statement it released </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBSJP/photos/a.531496596893112/2383080478401372/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that called upon student leadership to “refrain from attending the Perspectives Israel Trip.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this trip on the basis of morally deficient funding sources, normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom,” the organization wrote in this year’s petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP argues in the petition that any Associated Students (A.S.) senators who attended a Perspectives trip would have a conflict of interest if a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“divestment resolution”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were to be reintroduced this year. Over the past several years, A.S. senators have introduced various resolutions calling for A.S. and UCSB, among other UC entities, to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last spring was the sixth time in seven years that a version of the resolution was introduced to the A.S. Senate. The resolution failed last year, making UCSB the only undergraduate campus in the UC system that has not passed a divestment resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth, who is responsible for </span><a href=\"https://coc.as.ucsb.edu/position/office-of-the-attorney-general-attorney-general/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investigating and prosecuting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “any potential violations of ASUCSB Legal Code,” said in an email that conflicts of interest are defined in A.S. Legal Code as “situations of personal financial gain (A1), situations wherein votes are cast to benefit friends and family (A2), and situations where the interests of AS senators’ outside organizational involvements conflict with the interests of ASUCSB (A3).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said in a follow-up interview that while the Perspectives trips were mostly covered by the Santa Barbara Hillel, they did not count, in his interpretation of Legal Code, as a “financial gain,” since attendees did not actually receive any financial compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barth, in addition to a number of current and former elected members of A.S., went on the Perspectives trip this past summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I decided to go on this educational trip, I was seeking to enhance my knowledge of international issues through first-hand experience. If I thought it was a conflict of interest and would inhibit my ability to judge fairly and impartially as Attorney General the following year, I would not have gone,” Barth said in a message when asked if he believed his own attendance on the trip created a conflict of interest in determining if attending the trip created a conflict of interest for senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I maintain that, using the definition of conflict of interest in AS Legal Code that governs my position, Perspectives is not a conflict of interest for elected officials who have gone or intend to go on it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also argues that the application for the trip “implicitly states” that the trip will be unbiased but does not actually provide students with “a diversity of perspectives” because the trip is funded by Maccabee Task Force (MTF); MTF advertises itself on its website as an organization created “to combat the disturbing spread of anti-Semitism on America’s college campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the BDS movement is at the forefront of this troubling trend. We maintain that BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that crosses the line from legitimate criticism of Israel into the dangerous demonization of Israel and its supporters,” MTF continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is “a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and “aims to end international support for Israeli violations of international law by forcing companies, institutions and governments to change their policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition argues that MTF’s stance “demonstrate[s] [MTF’s] closed mindedness regarding the occupation, given its obvious and vehement opposition to the Palestinian call for</span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Israel (BDS).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP also condemns the fact that Sheldon Adelson — one of the </span><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/sheldon-adelson-casino-magnate-trump-macau-and-japan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biggest funders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and a “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2018/10/22/sheldon-adelson-breaks-spending-record-on-midterm-elections-surpassing-100m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conservative megadonor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” — serves as president of MTF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Furthermore, the reign of terror that Donald Trump and Republican Congresspeople have exacted on marginalized communities within the United States and across the globe, combined with the continued occupation of Palestine galvanized by far-right political figures in Israel, has been extensively funded by Adelson much like MTF’s Perspectives Trips,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also notes that the Santa Barbara Hillel received $238,739 from MTF in 2016 for “Campus Education and Trip to Israel” — the largest donation to a college campus listed on the </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201702979349300200/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maccabee Task Force’s 2016 tax returns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — and an additional $119,807 in </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201842699349301204/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There was no donation purpose listed on the 2017 returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This demonstrates the immense commitment from outside billionaires to engage in “pro-Israel” lobbying on students, specifically at the UCSB campus,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman, the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the organization receives funding from people with a wide variety of political views, but that a funder’s political leanings do not affect the kind of programming the center puts on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It happens, that in this case, we have a funder who we’re transparent about. If students ask, we will tell them where the particular funding from portions of this comes from,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our organization has a budget that is close to a million dollars; there’s no student who would be happy with the politics of every single one of those donors,” he added. “We have conservative students as well, who might not be happy with some of our progressive donors’ political leanings. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t use those funds to help put on Shabbat dinners on Friday night.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman also said he is personally responsible for putting together the itinerary for the Perspectives trip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That doesn’t mean that my own personal politics need to align with a lead donor on this project to make it a successful project,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Goodman said Hillel does not claim that the trip will be unbiased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I make it very clear, it’s not unbiased. We’re gonna show them lots of biases, we’re gonna show them a wide variety of different perspectives, and they’re not gonna agree with all of them,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that college students would come to college in order to advocate boycotts, and then advocate boycotts of things that could help you to learn more about the situation at hand or meet other people is patently absurd,” Goodman added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to opposing the trip due to its funding sources, SJP wrote in the petition that they are calling for a boycott of the trip because they believed the trip contributes to the “normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives Dylan Kupsh and Ivana Cruz said in an interview that they felt the need to circulate this petition because they believed “outside lobbyists” should not be influencing campus politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope people understand the real gravity at stake at UCSB and how much people are lobbying,” Kupsh said. “I would be outraged as a student to know that an outside person is influencing student politics more than students themselves or student orgs.”  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

What would you like to shrink down?’ Eventually everything started to stabilize out,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this process, Soc 152A evolved to more heavily emphasize the subject of sexual health and the sociology of healthy relationships, while putting less time into anthropology and general biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] aren’t that interested in sexual variations across different cultures,” Janice explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally thought the stuff was fascinating. We read so many studies in anthropology, and thought, ‘Oh my God! They do it so differently!’ I mean, every culture is filled with amazing examples of how different people treat sex and gender across the planet. We just got excited — but the students weren’t that interested,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time in the early ‘70s, Soc 152A also grew into a much larger class, from 100 students to 150, before the Baldwins moved to Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, teaching 300 students. Then finally, they made the leap to Campbell Hall — with its capability to shine enormous projections of the labia, the vas deferens, ejaculation and the female orgasm — all while lecturing to 600 to 650 students at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the decades of teaching the course, some subjects would vary from year to year, finding time in the limelight before dropping completely off the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are fads, you know. There was a fad of changing the minor lips [of the labia], going through surgery to get them cosmetically changed. Now the big thing is they get implants in your butt. That’s bigger than breast implants,” Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Baldwins’ perspective, having two people onstage in Campbell Hall improves students’ understanding of concepts taught while also preventing students from misinterpreting what any one person says. After all, sexuality is a topic which can spur strong reactions and brings with it some baggage, Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many people in the room that are sensitive to this. And I think if John said some of the things he says, and I wasn’t there, people could take it incorrectly,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Soc 152A] does cover some delicate topics. We think it’s important to have tools so that people don’t think that John’s teaching this from a male perspective —”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“— or wonder whether Janice is a radical feminist,” John added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those issues don’t come up much when we’re doing it together,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in an era more liberal and open than when the class was initially taught, and even with the advent of the internet and online resources for sex education — which the Baldwins themselves have contributed to — the Baldwins still say there is still a place for Soc 152A.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of people like international students … people from homes in which sex is not talked about, from very conservative backgrounds,” Janice said, adding that “it’s amazing how many people still benefit by taking Soc 152A.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Baldwins also found that in teaching a class like Soc 152A, their own relationship benefits. It has given them the ability to put a name onto all of the different feelings and elements which make up a loving relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you can verbalize things, you can plan things out a little bit better and make sure that you’ve got it really as good as you can make it,” John said. “In the old days, 50 years ago, there would have been Freudian speculation about love and relationships because it really wasn’t the science of love.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now there really is a science of love and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"><em>Updated 2/14/2020 2:02 p.m. </em></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrived </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the area</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a little over a year ago in early September, after partnering with UCSB for a three-year contract. However, the contract allowed HOPR to cancel at any time, as long as it gives the university 60-day notice, according to Chelsea Davidoff, a HOPR representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main challenge was economic, ridership revenue is not enough to pay the bills. This is true for most transit modes,” Davidoff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR’s ridership was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient enough to cover operating costs, according to James Wagner, program manager for the Transportation Alternatives Program (T.A.P.) at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most bicycle-share programs on college campuses need subsidies to survive and keep their rates affordable to customers, due to the expensive cost of buying and maintaining shared bicycles, Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The HOPR contract contemplated securing a sponsor but since they didn’t get one, the program was not economically feasible. As such they requested to cancel the contract,” Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB T.A.P. plans to replace HOPR’s service with another bicycle rental company, </span><a href=\"https://www.bcycle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCycle</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the future, Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &amp; Parking Services currently does not have room in its budget to front the cost for a bicycle-share program, Wagner said. HOPR did not initially ask for a subsidy because it expected to secure a sponsor, which is why it was contracted, Davidoff added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“HOPR provided an option to the University to sponsor or subsidize the program as part of the transportation budget, but this budget was not available,” Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We may open another request for proposals (RFP) to see if other bicycle share vendors are willing to provide bicycle share at no cost to the university besides user fees,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognized as a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Part of this recognition is due to the large number of bicycles available to share on campus through HOPR, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR remains in other cities and universities throughout the country where it has found more economic success, such as UC Los Angeles, the University of South Florida and the cities of Santa Monica, Atlanta and Orlando, according to Davidoff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidoff said that despite the early contract termination, HOPR leaves UCSB thankful for the opportunity from the university and support from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope they find a budget for bike share, students love it, it is affordable, healthy, fun and environmentally friendly. If there is a will, there’s always a way,” Davidoff said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

On Dec. 9, hundreds of graduate students went on a wildcat strike, meaning the strike is not authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students, as part of their strike, refused to release over 12,000 undergraduate grades by the submission deadline of Dec. 18 until the university agreed to a COLA of $1,412 a month to supplement their current TA salaries. The university refused, and this past Monday, UCSC graduate students began an indefinite full wildcat strike, meaning a strike without the authorization of their union, UC Student-Workers Union (UAW Local 2865). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of the UC COLA movements is the concept of rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of one’s wages on rent, according to the UCSC COLA website. Students’ rent burdens vary from campus to campus, but across the UC, organizers have been using rent burden to calculate COLAs specific to their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While only the UCSC COLA movement has officially gone on strike, several other UCs, such as UCSB and UCSD, have now drafted and presented demands to leadership at their respective universities. At other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, COLA movements are in their infancy, but are growing fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with organizers at various UC campuses to document their COLA movements and the stages each movement is in. </span></p>\n<p>Further coverage of UCSB’s COLA movement can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>UC Santa Cruz:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students finished their third day on strike on Wednesday; throughout the day, hundreds of graduate students linked arms and blocked the intersection at the base of UCSC’s campus, facing off against a blockade of police officers and disrupting bus services. At least 16 people were arrested and given citations, City on a Hill Press reported, but as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, only one remained in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a press release sent out by the UCSC COLA movement, at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> least one student allegedly “had her finger broken by police, another was bleeding profusely from his head after being hit by batons, and others received bruised ribs and bones.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association, explained that at UCSC, the demand for a COLA officially began in November, when graduate students presented their demands to the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Cruz students pay 50, 60, 70% of their wages of rent per month, which makes it next to impossible to afford most other things, especially if you have medical copays or childcare or any kind of emergency,” Komori said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSC graduate students are on an indefinite strike; those who are a part of the COLA movement are not holding office hours and sections and will not release undergraduate students’ fall quarter and upcoming winter quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said that last week, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive offered new programs for graduate students that would help offset the cost of living, such as one that offers five years of funding at their current pay rate, and another than would provide a $2,500 a year housing supplement or fellowship for those in need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Komori called the offers “insufficient,” and said that showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the last she heard, administration would be starting “disciplinary action against the strike.” Several graduate students posted to social media about receiving disciplinary hearing summons and formal warning letters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Monday, upwards of 1,500 UCSC undergraduate students have also signed a petition in support of their graduate students, Komori said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said the university is now refusing to meet with the striking graduate students now that they are “carrying out an unsanctioned strike.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been updating through the Twitter account </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@payusmoreucsc and on the website payusmoreucsc.com. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon said the strike at UCSC is “illegal” and that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC San Diego: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego’s COLA movement began last year, when the university’s Housing, Dining and Hospitality Unit — the equivalent of UCSB’s Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises — planned to increase graduate students’ rents for on-campus apartments, according to Celine Khoury, a doctoral student in literature and recording secretary within the San Diego chapter of United Automobile Workers (UAW) Local 2865, the UC-wide union representing graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students held a housing march to protest the plan, but the unit raised the price of rent regardless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was out of this momentum that the UCSD COLA movement formed, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our [graduate students] make up 15% of our workforce,” Khoury said. “UCSD has the largest number of academic employees out of all of the UCs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a UCSD COLA fact sheet posted to the movement’s Twitter account, graduate teaching assistants made $2,434 a month, and a majority of them paid over 42% of their monthly wages in rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khoury described the UCSD COLA moment as very “grassroots” and “collaborative,” explaining that there are a number of members of the UCSD COLA movement that are also involved with the UCSD Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the campus union, UAW 2865. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, the UCSD GSA unanimously passed a resolution that supported both the striking UCSC workers as well as any future action taken by graduate students at UC San Diego, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, approximately 80 members of the UCSD COLA movement, alongside a few campus groups and undergraduates, held a “peaceful march” across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group made its way to UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s office, where they planned on delivering their demands, which include providing all student workers with housing stipends that translate to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month; lowering rent on all existing on-campus housing; and building affordable on-campus housing for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Khosla didn’t open the door, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, organizers “chanted the letter” and, before they left, “taped all of our signs to the chancellor’s door and the [outside] walls of his office.” Now, they are waiting for the chancellor to respond to their demands. The UCSD COLA movement also held a public forum Wednesday night, open to all students and faculty, to provide updates on the UC-wide COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ColaUcsd. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Rich, a doctoral student in English at UC Davis, said the UCD COLA movement began in December, in solidarity with the UCSC COLA movement. Several other UC COLA movements also held rallies in solidarity with UCSC on the same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our initial purpose was to just try and support them, but we pretty quickly, like a lot of other campuses, were realizing that we have a lot of similar problems that Santa Cruz is having … so we used that first event as a jumping off point.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich said the movement is currently composed of a smaller group of graduate students rather than an entire organization. They plan to attend their UCD GSA meeting and talk to the local union members about how to broaden the movement, Rich said, and they’re also starting to reach out to undergraduates as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Rich is hoping they can draft a list of demands that also would help with equity between departments or guaranteed summer funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few members of the UCD COLA movement also travelled to UC Santa Cruz to support the strikers; according to the @ucd4cola Twitter account, one of the UCD COLA organizers was among those arrested during the Wednesday UCSC COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ucd4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Berkeley: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tara Phillips, UAW 2865 and UC Berkeley COLA organizer, said the COLA movement at UC Berkeley is “still in its infancy,” noting that it was difficult to get a COLA movement off the ground because the campus union wasn’t supportive of the movement “until recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement’s first action was in December, she said, when around 70 people held a solidarity rally for UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] talked about how difficult it is to get by here, how precarious the lives of grad students are because pay is so low and rent is so high,” Phillips said. “Folks were talking about landlord abuse and the inability to pay for medical treatment, loans that folks need to take out just to supplement their income … [but] also how much we love teaching, and that we wish the university valued it more.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillips said that while most graduate students pay 50% or more of their wages on rent, that payment only lasts for 10 months of the year — nine months for the UC campuses on the quarter system — and most students “have to scramble over the summer to get rent money together, because teaching is not guaranteed in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re living very stressful, financially precarious lives for a long time,” she said, adding that she believes the university has done a “very poor job” in terms of equity across the various UC Berkeley departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly – the equivalent of UCSB’s GSA – and UAW 2863 passed a resolution in support of the UCSC strike last week, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Phillips said the movement is “just starting to map out what the future looks like for us, and how to keep building that movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re sort of in this educational phase … but ideally we’d like to be able to turn out a lot of graduate students to a general assembly, and discuss collectively what we want, what our demands look like, and how to pressure the administration to give us a COLA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that UAW 2865 came up with a projected COLA for UC Berkeley to bring students out of rent burden — $2,103, the highest number so far across the UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting on the Facebook page “Cal COLA: Pay Us More UCB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Los Angeles: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA GSA President Zak Fisher, who attends UCLA School of Law, explained that after UCSC students went on strike, the conversation of a UCLA COLA became a “hot topic of conversation.” He noted, however, that there is “no official club” for a UCLA COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen this campus today engaging this important question of, ‘How do we fight for a cost-of-living adjustment or for cost-of-living issues more generally?’ I haven’t met a graduate student yet who said, ‘No way, we get paid enough, what are you doing?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that he ran for GSA president on a platform of creating a cost-of-living adjustment for graduate students, among other issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, graduate students are spreading a survey around in hopes of getting a better idea of how rent-burdened students are, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GSA president, Fisher said he has spoken to administrators about the issues that he ran on, but “they’ll give you lip service all day, saying ‘Hey, these are important issues,’ but then you’ll meet with them three months later and say, ‘Oh, what have you done? Absolutely nothing.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he’s seen support from UCLA undergraduate students as well, noting that the undergraduate student government and the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support for UCSC strikers, demanding that there be no retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone is starting to realize, this is our collective fight and our collective struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting under the Twitter handle @ucla4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB COLA Outreach Committee member Adam Parison confirmed that a “pretty small” COLA movement was beginning at UC Riverside, but that the movement has no social media platforms yet, and Parison could not provide contact information for any COLA organizers at UCR.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

social media, students expressed frustration at the termination of the long-standing tool. But the data it used to function has since become outdated, explained Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that most of the map’s original operators have also since left the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the age of the infrastructure and some complex configuration issues, staff members with skills sets that we previously had, who understood the nuances of the configuration, are no longer here at UCSB,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s grown to a point where we need to staff and license it appropriately.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map began as a joint academic project between the geography department and other data providers on campus to locate lecture halls, classrooms, food establishments and hydration stations as well as parking structures and meters, according to Hall. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the map was opened to the UCSB community in February 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, early stages of its development began in 2008 under the leadership of Dylan Parenti, the information technology manager of the geography department at the time. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Nexus article published in 2013,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the map relies on multiple layers of software which combine to make the map a multifaceted geographical tool.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the map featured interactive tools, including self-guided tours through natural spaces like the Campus Lagoon and lists of the energy consumptions of various buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Estrada, university spokesperson, said that discussions are now ongoing about “the best way to create and maintain tools and resources for navigating the university and real time and helping to ensure the best campus experience for students, faculty, staff and visitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hall and his team await the approval and funding they need to relaunch the map, they are working to improve certain elements of it, such as its access to the Environmental Systems Research Institute and Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System, information databases that provide geographic data, Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the funding comes through, “we’ll be right back at it,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 18, 2020]: This article was

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years. <em>Channing Mink / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million upgrade from 10 to 100 gigabit links is set to be completed in April, but buildings such as the University Library could see immediate improvements in data transmission speed, according to Kevin Schmidt, UCSB’s director of Enterprise Technology Services, who is in charge of the router replacement project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Schmidt said that there will not be a very noticeable immediate impact on internet speeds in most other parts of campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the previous router installation was in 2010, the rapid progression of technology in the past decade has increased demand for larger data usage, according to Schmidt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The center part of our network … is operating at speeds that were fine for its day, but the aggregate demand that we have is large enough that in order to support the future of this campus’ teaching research and community service mission, we must upgrade this,” Schmidt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years, according to Schmidt, at which point they will have to be upgraded again.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million used for the project includes the cost of the routers, labor for installation and maintenance for over the next seven years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB data network will be down during the router installation from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following Wednesdays: Feb. 26, March 4, April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By increasing the capacity of the data network, Schmidt said the data transmission speed at individual buildings can then be improved. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If data speeds in specific buildings were increased without building more data capacity, it would be like making “really big roads that lead right into a two-lane highway,” Schmidt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do first is make the highway bigger, and then we’ll make the streets out to the residential neighborhoods larger,” Schmidt added, referring to various other buildings on campus as the “residential neighborhoods.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the time span for replacing the new routers is listed as three hours, the actual installations could be as short at 15 minutes, decreasing the amount of time the network is down, according to Schmidt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upgraded network could also facilitate easier use of multimedia teaching materials, such as video, according to Rich Wolski, a professor in the computer science department at UCSB. Video uses such a large amount of data relative to other internet uses that the campus will “overwhelmingly” notice the upgrade in the form of faster video loading speeds, he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were to go to another research school, you would expect 10 gigabit networking to be present, you might not expect 100 [gigabits],” Wolski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond internet usage, data transmissions on campus can typically be from researchers downloading information from NASA satellites, according to Schmidt. Information downloaded can include weather patterns and ocean temperatures over periods of time.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step in the project is to evaluate the data connections between the central network and the service in individual buildings, according to Schmidt. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fixed the highway that brings us into the city, and then we need to look at those roads that lead off the highway into the neighborhoods,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:

community.</span> <em>Nadia Lee Abushanab / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like a black sheep,” he said. “The surfing community can be very tight-knit and territorial. I didn’t feel seen there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he wanted to find a way for all students to have access to the outdoors regardless of economic, social and structural barriers, so he created Making Adventure Possible for All Students, known around campus as MAPAS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS, established in November 2017, is a club dedicated to diversifying the outdoors and fostering stewardship for the environment, Gonzalez said. He founded the organization with the intention of creating a welcoming community and increasing opportunities for marginalized groups to experience outdoor adventures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor activities tend to be homogenous and exclude underrepresented groups, Gonzalez said. Outdoor gear is expensive and purchasing the equipment required to participate in adventures is not feasible for some students, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he does not believe that the outdoor community intentionally excludes marginalized groups, but that there are structural factors that can limit access to these spaces, and it is important to recognize and address those factors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People’s parents have to work, they don’t have access to the outdoors, maybe they live in cities,” Gonzalez pointed out. He also noted the lack of public transit to natural spaces, such as national parks, as a further limitation on who is able to visit those spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged groups who aim to make adventuring more affordable for students, like UCSB Adventure Programs and Excursion Club, Gonzalez said MAPAS was created to address a deeper problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has really robust opportunities for adventure,” MAPAS Outdoors Chair and fifth-year psychology major Phoebe Rogers said. “At first glance, it’s easy to see the barrier just being a paywall, but it’s more than that for us. MAPAS is trying to carve a space where people of color and people from diverse backgrounds feel like the space was made for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for an all-inclusive outdoor community club first came to Gonzalez from a surfing trip. While out on the water one morning, Gonzalez said an exchange student from Mexico paddled up to him and they immediately connected with one another through sharing tips and stories about surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He looked like me,” Gonzalez said. “I remember thinking, ‘Is this how everyone else feels? Is this how it always feels to have a community out here?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hold onto that feeling and to encourage more diversity in the surfing community, Gonzalez had the idea to create a Latinx surfing team. But after a while, he decided he wanted the club to include all outdoor activities, not just surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to breaking the opportunity gap and diversifying the outdoors, Gonzalez said he wanted to bring people into the outdoors to foster greater environmental stewardship, further the conversation of environmental justice and raise awareness of the inequitable environmental burdens people of color and low-income communities experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I care about environmental issues. I’m in love with the outdoors; why wouldn’t I want to take care of it?” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After recruiting others who were passionate about this issue, Gonzalez said MAPAS secured funding from faculty and community members through a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/mapas-20192020-fund?fbclid=IwAR3c5AlAFNXvwvO8n7IwuDGtpf9b3vsmwa5N073AtJ1BrWQ8q0V2mg0_nqY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and applied for grants through the UCSB Healthy Campus Network. MAPAS uses these funds to purchase and rent outdoor gear, purchase food, campsites and permits, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, MAPAS has organized several hikes, kayaking trips, climbing events and volunteer restoration projects as well as a backpacking trip to Big Sur. MAPAS also hosts potlucks for its members to foster a sense of community and create opportunities for connection, which Rogers said is the ultimate goal of the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear to see what kind of community we are building, and how different that feels compared to other spaces on campus,” Rogers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of our events feel really familial, and it’s different when you have an intention and a purpose coming together. There’s more of an energy to it,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Rogers said MAPAS has plans to continue with its “Demystifying Backpacking” workshop series to share information about backpacking. In the workshop, more experienced MAPAS members get together with first-time backpackers to break down and explain everything one needs to know about backpacking, from what gear to bring to how to purify water to what to do about going to the bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS also has plans to include professors in its trips to break down the “student-faculty ivory tower barrier,” Rogers said. By going on a hike with a professor, Gonzalez hopes that students can make connections with faculty outside of the classroom and learn about different research and academic opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez hopes MAPAS will be an inspiration for other UCs to create their own version of the club and eventually have a widespread community that encourages diversity in the outdoors across different campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MAPAS aims to address the lack of diversity in outdoor spaces and bring more people into the conversation,” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our intention is to be a launchpad,” Rogers said. “Our goal is for our members to build the skills so that they feel comfortable putting themselves into outdoor spaces and breaking down the barriers together so that those spaces don’t feel so intimidating and closed off.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Graduate students have been organizing the demands since Jan. 21, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“sick-out”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of UCSC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily, a first-year sociology graduate student who declined to give her last name, spoke to the crowd at the University Library on Monday about how the list of demands was created, noting that it was important that as many graduate student voices as possible were included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We read all the comments on the 994 surveys we got, we took it into consideration, we wrote these and this is what we came up with,” Emily told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All campuses across UC are organizing in some way for this COLA, and that’s how we’re going to get strength and prove to the administration that something’s got to change if we stand together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lex Taylor, a third-year political science and economics major, also spoke to the crowd in front of the library, representing a handful of undergraduate students who marched in solidarity with graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are mostly taught by grad students. These are the people making sure this university is working … that we are going into our classes getting the education we deserve,” Taylor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor also referenced the three-year long </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union as a sign that COLA efforts can be successful too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME, for the last three years, striked on and off, and they won. Right now at Santa Cruz, grad students are starting to strike, we are about to give our demands all across the UCs and grad students are showing what they can do,” Taylor added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Emily read the demands aloud and several graduate students spoke regarding the need for COLA, the group marched from the University Library to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where students presented the list of demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond asking for a COLA, the students’ demands included several stipulations: that the COLA amount will be recalculated annually to account for increases in housing costs, that a COLA will not come from an increase in graduate or undergraduate tuition, that the university will not retaliate in any form against those supporting or participating in the demand for a COLA and that the university will accommodate the higher financial needs of graduate students with children or dependent adults.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand letter also highlighted the COLA’s necessity and explained that the amount comes from calculating average graduate student income and housing costs in the local area, to determine what amount is necessary per month to keep graduate students from rent burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter explained that the baseline for a rent burden is 31%, meaning that 31% or more of an individual’s income goes towards housing. However, the average rent burden for graduate students at UCSB is 51%, as calculated by UAW 2865.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stipend necessary to alleviate rent burden at UCSB is the fourth-highest stipend estimate in the UC system, behind Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, according to the UAW report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students earn their income from a variety of different funding sources, such as fellowships, grants, teaching assistant positions and research. Because sources of income vary from student to student and may change on a quarterly basis, UCSB graduate students emphasized in the demands letter that they are asking for a cost-of-living adjustment that is dispersed each month through the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB graduate students, “regardless of their graduate program, department, year in program, residence, visa category, documentation, funding source, and employment status,” will receive the same COLA amount, according to demands.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon stated that the strike at UCSC is “illegal,” adding that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon explained that the university reached a four-year contract with UAW in August 2018 and that the contract is in place through June 2020. He said that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while the University does not plan to reopen the signed and ratified contract with UAW, we did recently hold a meeting to discuss legitimate student concerns regarding housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC appreciates the information provided by the UAW and the ongoing dialogue regarding affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the demands have been released to the university, UCSB graduate students will move forward with increasing awareness around the push for a COLA and negotiating with the university, with no plans in the works for a strike, according to multiple graduate students at previous COLA meetings.</span></p>\n<p>Additional photos and coverage of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1226971585468358657\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/in-photos-ucsb-graduate-students-present-cola-demands-amidst-uc-wide-rallies/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

There, he helped to facilitate the Central Coast’s first-ever cannabis community and grew a passion for connecting with growers, testifying in court for cannabis regulations and fostering the local cannabis community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spring Quarter 2019, he was approached by the president of UC Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Cannaclub, who reached out to encourage him to start his own chapter at UC Santa Barbara.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The president] said, ‘Zain, you go to UCSB, why don’t you empower the student voice, why don’t you give the students a voice in the [cannabis] community?’” Qureshi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know whether there’s going to be a big interest in [the club]. I didn’t know because I was working with professionals in the field for so long. Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is.
