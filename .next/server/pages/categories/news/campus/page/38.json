Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

the Nov. 17 meeting. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Several students and faculty members attended Thursday’s meeting in the Graduate Student Lounge in the MultiCultural Center to learn more about the future of the center and share their own goals and concerns.</p>\n<p>“The town hall is an opportunity to share with students what has been going on at the RCSGD as well as to ask for input on what our plans for the future might be,” said Justice Dumlao, the RCSGD diversity education facilitator during an interactive group discussion.</p>\n<p>During a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-17/resource-center-for-sexual-and-gender-diversity-receives-approval-for-new-building-doubled-budget-after-university-signs-demands/\">previous meeting</a> on Nov. 17, RCSGD staff presented a list of demands to the administration and claimed that the WGSE did not treat them fairly. The staff referenced a Nov. 14 incident when the center’s associate director was fired and removed from the Student Resource Building without warning.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD was immediately removed from underneath its umbrella organization and the university administration agreed to a freestanding building that would house the new RCSGD, as well as several other demands that included a doubling of the program’s budget.</p>\n<p>The organization’s current name will be changed later this year.</p>\n<p>“The RCSGD title had previously fit the student body but may no longer accommodate the communities’ needs,” said Hikaru Ezra Mernin, the Transforce task coordinator.</p>\n<p>Mernin explained that it may be difficult for students to tell their friends or family members “I work at the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity,” which is why a slightly more ambiguous or “non-outing” title should be established.</p>\n<p>They also said that the lack of adequate assistance has made tasks “more complex” and has been “hindering the RCGSD’s progress.”</p>\n<p>Students also expressed concern about the graduate student hiring process. Many felt that undergraduates should be able to work with the administration to determine which candidates may be a good fit.</p>\n<p>RCSGD office manager Ogui Gonzalez said the “student voices are currently not centered and students should be able to put in their input and be involved in the interview process.”</p>\n<p>In addition to increased participation in the hiring process, students requested upperclassmen housing for queer and transgender students.</p>\n<p>Diversity Programs Director Carlos Nash said that this may be implemented in the future because the housing faculty members are already planning to incorporate Living Learning Communities into upperclassmen housing.</p>\n<p>“The Newman Housing Queer and Trans Cooperative in Isla Vista is currently taking applications, and interested students should apply as soon as they can,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Newman House provides LGBTQ students with the chance to live in an inclusive environment and to meet other people from the community.</p>\n<p>RCGD staff member Johari Hunt also introduced the RCGSD’s new mentorship program. Any interested student can apply to be a mentee, and faculty members are encouraged to volunteer as mentors.

Some lost friends and others were stranded south of the freeway closure, forced to rely on alternate forms of transportation to reach campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRAPPED</strong></p>\n<p>While many students fled the fires by going back to their hometowns, most faculty and staff did not have that option.</p>\n<p>“I went stir crazy,” said Janet Mizrahi, a professor in the writing department, in an email. “I continued to meet my goal of 10,000 steps daily by listening to an audiobook while I walked in circles in my small house! My dog thought I was nuts!”</p>\n<p>For Nomi Morris, another professor in the writing department who lives in Upper Ojai, the fire originated near Ojai and blazed through her neighborhood, giving her only a half an hour to gather her belongings. While her own street was spared, many houses in her neighborhood were destroyed.</p>\n<p>She first evacuated her home and came to Goleta with her family, until the unhealthy air quality pushed them to move further north and stay with a family friend.</p>\n<p>Some professors living in voluntary evacuation zones also had to leave their homes just before finals week. Many made their exams optional or changed them to take-home finals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>\n<p>The mudslides in January also made it difficult for many faculty and staff to get to campus.</p>\n<p>Writing professor Ilene Miele was forced to drive through Ventura during the Thomas Fire until she ultimately decided to cancel class for a day because of the fire’s proximity to Route 101. For the past week, she has been taking the ferry to Santa Barbara, initially relying on a colleague to drive her to campus before learning about a UCSB shuttle service at the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>\n<p>“What caused the most anxiety for me, at first, was not knowing how I would get there and make it to the first day of class,” Miele said in an email. “The first day they warned us to expect a rocky ride, but it was a fairly gentle roll … Overall, I was fortunate that we had good weather and the rides were fairly quick (an hour and a half each way).”</p>\n<p>Morris stayed in Santa Barbara for the first week of the quarter due to closed roads and classes that end too late for her to take a train back.</p>\n<p>According to Mary Ferris, executive director of Student Health Service, staff at Student Health also faced exceptional difficulty ensuring coverage with blocked roads and the recent flu outbreaks. Understaffing, combined with increased demand stretched the staff thin, resulting in longer hours.</p>\n<p>She said that because of the staff’s commitment to health, they went to extreme lengths to reach campus, with some staff staying overnight in Santa Barbara for the week. One pharmacist even flew to Santa Barbara from Oxnard in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a new challenge,” Ferris said. “When you’re in healthcare you can’t just close.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond physical losses, the constant evacuations and impacted schedules have taken an emotional toll on staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>“I managed to stay calm from day to day, but never quite sure when and if I would freak out,” Paul Sonnino, a professor in the history department, said in an email. “Haven’t yet, but the sense of uncertainty is taking its toll.”</p>\n<p>Mizrahi lost a close personal friend who was swept away by the mudslide.</p>\n<p>“Losing a contemporary is a devastating kind of loss — after all, it so easily could have been me,” she said in an email. “It’s emotionally devastating.”</p>\n<p>For Miele, her experiences being blocked from campus and driving through the fire have left her uncertain.</p>\n<p>“These days when I get on the 101, I think of it as the highway of doubt. Depending on the conditions, you’re never quite sure whether you’ll get there or if you’ll get home,” she said. “Much as I know we need the rain in Southern California, I’ll be glad when winter is over this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>RETURNING TO CAMPUS</strong></p>\n<p>Some professors also faced backlash from students over the cancellation of classes and office hours.</p>\n<p>“Some insensitive students — just a couple — got very upset because I did not give them automatic ‘A’s as compensation for my having had to cancel some office hours since the fire was approaching my house,” Sonnino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Other professors greatly enjoyed returning to campus, with students expressing concern for their well-being.</p>\n<p>“It was a relief to see young people, you know, hear the regular questions, and I’m enjoying my students immensely,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UNIVERSITY RESPONSE</strong></p>\n<p>Under the difficult circumstances, many praised the university for offering financial assistance through a special fund for faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Some, however, have raised concerns about the speed at which UCSB made decisions.</p>\n<p>“As a faculty member I had the flexibility to cancel classes when I thought it was unsafe, but I know that staff members did not necessarily have that same flexibility,” Miele said. “So, while I understand that there are many complexities involved, I have concerns about the university’s ability to respond more quickly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the financial assistance, the experience has been challenging for those who were blocked by the roads.</p>\n<p>“The university has been terrific, but it is draining, it is stressful [and] it is harder to work. We’re all doing our best,” Morris said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>LOOKING BACK</strong></p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, faculty and staff echoed the same sentiment — things could have been worse.</p>\n<p>“I just continually have this feeling that I got off easy,” said Morris, grateful that she still has her home, despite the lingering smell of smoke. “I just really want to make this clear that compared to what the people in Montecito are going through, I went through nothing.”</p>\n<p>Sonnino echoed similar sentiments, saying that compared to tragedies around the world, losing utilities at his house or a nearby bridge shattering are insignificant.</p>\n<p>“It only made me aware of how much worse off are people in Aleppo, Israel, Palestine, Puerto Rico, Seoul and other places who live under imminent threat day in and day out,” he said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone copes with tragedy in different ways.</p>\n<p>Assistant professor Leah Stokes was pushed into action after a frustrated tweet about climate change garnered positive responses.</p>\n<p>Her op-ed in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, titled “Climate Change in my Backyard,” addresses the impact of climate change on recent climate disruptions, and acts as a “call to action,” urging people to focus more on environmental policy.</p>\n<p>“You just need one degree of separation to meet someone affected by this,” Stokes said. “My op-ed is about changing people’s minds, about how we talk about these events.”</p>\n<p>She hopes that people will speak out and influence others to understand that blaming Montecito residents for not evacuating is simple. Instead, she said, people need to understand the greater causes behind the devastation.</p>\n<p>Others focused on philanthropy and helping their community. Morris personally raised over $3,000 for two people who she knew were in need.</p>\n<p>For Mizrahi, the loss of her friend has pushed her to embrace the present.</p>\n<p>“For me, it just made me focus on right now and living,” she said. “It’s like I got a fire built under my butt … I’m not waiting, I’m not waiting, I’m just doing it now — because who knows what tomorrow will bring?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket. He explained that a student who needed to travel south to Los Angeles or San Diego was given approximately $40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who needed to travel north to San Francisco or Sacramento were given approximately $100 for the fare, Miller said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 students received funding, according to Brooke Kopel, a college of letters and sciences senator and third-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire has burned 252,500 acres and is 35 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory evacuations have occurred across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and 972 structures have been destroyed.

Jimenez, a second-year undeclared major at UC Santa Barbara, settled on the idea for her interactive sculpture due to the recent impact of the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said in an email that the #MeToo Twitter hashtag recognizes how many people, mostly women, are sexually assaulted and “exposes the alarming numbers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said the project has a great deal of personal significance to her because she is a survivor of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she found it very difficult to acknowledge and speak of her experience, but that she regained a sense of hope and power after seeing the #MeToo movement trending on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the project, Jimenez was initially worried that simply posting a large sign with the hashtag would be too obvious, but quickly noticed that many students were still unaware of the meaning behind the viral campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t want people to think that I was trying to turn a subject that’s so important and disgusting into just a pretty photo opp or something ‘aesthetic,’” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she believed it would be powerful to see how many flowers stacked up on her art piece, representing how many people have been affected by sexual assault directly or indirectly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students choose to complete their projects off campus in Isla Vista, but Jimenez said for her that was not an option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I insisted on my piece being on campus because that’s the main audience I wanted to view my piece: my own peers,” Jimenez wrote in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said art students are often deterred from displaying their final projects on campus due to the time constraints of the project and the difficulty of getting permission from the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez decided not to submit a request to display her piece on the Storke Tower lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured in the context of my own project, it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jimenez could be creative with the idea and creation of the project, she said she is grateful for the input and help she received along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the project would not have been possible without the support of three people: her professor, her aunt who owns a Carpinteria flower shop and UCSB woodshop technician Michael Matheson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she has mostly received positive responses to her piece, yet some people are still unaware of the topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that students have also responded positively on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All positive responses so far where people realize the importance of the topic and continue to make this a supportive platform for victims to feel heard, accepted, and loved,” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the days following the installment of her piece, students and faculty could be seen on Storke Tower lawn, placing flowers and silently observing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez’s piece was left on Storke Tower lawn as students rushed home from UCSB due to the Thomas Fire. It remains there today, where Jimenez believes it will remain until maintenance staff returns to work.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The project to repair El Centro began in January after the university notified students that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>The project cost approximately $900,000, according to UC Santa Barbara spokesperson Andrea Estrada. Student Affairs contributed $100,000, and the university allocated the remaining $800,000 through the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>University officials originally told students to evacuate El Centro within 45 days, saying the building would either be demolished or improved within that time period. The alarming notice provoked outcry from student groups that use the historical space.</p>\n<p>The university intended to complete the project over the summer, but plumbing complications and changes with university officials overseeing the project slowed the project’s process, said Lorena Alvarez, a fourth-year English major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>“I guess they didn’t realize how many structural issues the building had,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>El Centro serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The building is located in two combined industrial trailers and was initially designed to last 10 years, according to campus architects. The building has long outlasted its lifespan, and cultural groups that have occupied the space since the 1970s demand a permanent foundation for its walls.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the building repairs were slow at the start of the summer due to plumbing complications and when a project manager went on vacation, but progress sped up when Alvarez returned to UCSB in August.</p>\n<p>“Over the summer, you would have seen nothing being done to El Centro, and when I came back in August, you started seeing weekly changes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Former campus architect Marc Fisher, who was one of the lead contributors to the project, left UCSB over the summer to take a job at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the El Centro Committee worked with Fisher until he left and has since communicated with Renee Bahl, associate vice chancellor for Design, Facilities and Safety Services, about the repairs.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee was designed to monitor the building repairs and keep an open line of communication between students and administrators. The group meets weekly to discuss the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t architects,” Alvarez said. “We want to make sure we understand what’s happening as students.”</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began in February, the university added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building.</p>\n<p>These structures made the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes, campus architect Ed Schmittgen told the <em>Nexus</em> in April, and the university opted to repair the building instead of demolish it.</p>\n<p>Some student organizations have been able to use various parts of the building throughout the reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In October, El Congreso was permitted to use the second floor of the building once again, after being unable to use it for the first few weeks of Fall Quarter, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Two rooms were also available for students to use as study spaces, and two full time Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) counselors and cultural mentors began using the space to hold office hours.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee also received $9,000 from the Associated Students Senate in October to purchase a security system for the building.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the system will have card readers and make it easier for students to access the building more frequently, even when other student groups are not holding office hours or using the building.</p>\n<p>“We had an issue with students being not being able to get into El Centro because it was locked,” Alvarez said. “Getting the card reader … would be a safer way for them to navigate through the building and get access to the building.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the university has been transparent about its work on the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m really thankful that they’re allowing us to be a part of these conversations and ask for things when we need clarifications,” Alvarez said. “They’ve been really helpful in that sense.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead confirmed there was an officer in the building, but said they did not escort Muro out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to apologize and say that I’m really sorry for the trauma that was caused with the police being present,” Dolan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abigail Salazar Rodriguez, RCSGD program coordinator, submitted an intent to resign in solidarity with Muro, according to Hikaru Ezra Mernin, RCSGD’s trans taskforce advocacy coordinator and third-year feminist studies major and LGBTQ studies minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB administration agreed to welcome her back if she is willing to return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, signed the commitment with Minal Habash, RCSGD internal coordinator and fourth-year UCSB student, and Mernin present after a brief recess during Friday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really hoping that this is going to be effective permanent change to the way that things run in student affairs,” Mernin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WGSE was first opened in Fall of 1975 and moved to its current location in the SRB in 2002.

The statement said the incident put the safety of the space, the student’s trust and students and staff members of color in harm’s way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They called for the university to reinstate Muro and Salazar and begin to put these changes in effective immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD also demanded the resignations of Equinoa and Dolan for perpetuating violence against queer, transgender people and marginalized communities and their complicity in “perpetuating the systems of white supremacy at this institution.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mernin’s reading of the statement was followed by RCSGD’s list of demands, which focused on creating of a permanent LGBTQIA Resource Center, separate from the WGSE.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mernin is the primary author of the current demands.

Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Not enough [people] participate in the resistance against the continuation of the perpetuation of rape culture,” said Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student and a lead speaker at May’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in</a>, as she opened the meeting with a statement expressing her continued frustration.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara administrators led Tuesday’s panel in Harold Frank Hall, speaking on behalf of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, also presented updates on each of the demands.</p>\n<p>The panel included Katya Armistead, dean of student life; Kim Equinoa, assistant dean of students; Briana Conway, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.); Jeanne Stanford, director of Counseling and Psychological Services; Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Yang<strong>; </strong>and Cathy Farley, assistant chief for the UC Police Department.</p>\n<p>Earvin expressed her frustration at the university’s handling of the demands, saying Armistead failed to solicit students to join committees to comply with the demands through a university announcement.</p>\n<p>“Ro Earvin, in unity with the A.N.W.O branch of UCSB and the Student Activist Network are looking for students interested in working on committees created for the demands signed May 4th 2017 in response to the University’s response to Sexual Assault. And for more information to contact me at <em>r.smivsb@gmail.com</em> with the demand(s) interested in working on and a schedule,” Earvin said in her email to UC administration.</p>\n<p>Armistead said she misunderstood Earvin’s request and sent out an email advertising Tuesday’s town hall to all students.</p>\n<p>Following Earvin’s opening statement, attendees received updates on each of the 12 demands made by nowUCsb, an organization which strives to “expose and reform broken campus policies on sexual violence” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The administration marked each demand as “incomplete,” “complete” or “in progress.” The panel then provided specific information on the progress of each demand.</p>\n<p>The first demand was to create and fund a survivor resource center in Isla Vista. According to Klawunn, the university provides legal and counseling services for survivors, despite there being no “one-stop shop” for these resources. The demand was marked as incomplete, but the panel said it was interested in looking further into the matter.</p>\n<p>The second demand, which said C.A.P.S. must provide adequate and timely mental health services to survivors and their families, was marked as in progress.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. Director Conway said the organization now has eight staff members, which she described as its largest staff ever. She said C.A.P.S. has also diversified the days and times for group counseling and activities.</p>\n<p>The third demand sought mandatory sensitivity trainings for UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol that address race, gender, class and sexuality in connection to sexual assault and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Assistant UCPD Chief Farley said UCPD and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office attended a three-day training this August. Additionally, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/detective-joins-ivfp-following-student-protests-demands/\">IVFP hired a new detective</a>, Julio Gutierrez, to handle sexual assault and interpersonal violence in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said demand four, asking Santa Barbara City College to be more transparent about students who have been disciplined for Title IX violations, is complete.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX director Ariana Alvarez will be collaborating with the Title IX director at SBCC.</p>\n<p>The seventh demand, for survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence to be able to transfer to a different university, is already in practice, Klawunn said. The UC facilitates UC-to-UC transfers for survivors.</p>\n<p>Demand 10, which required integrating Queer Connect, an educational workshop that focuses on sexual assault, dating violence and stalking within LGBTQ communities, to reporting and trainings, was also implemented and officially began at the beginning of Fall Quarter, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven demands were marked incomplete, but members of the panel assured those in attendance they are working to meet them.</p>\n<p>Demand six ordered administration to work with the I.V. CSD to create a report card for government institutions and law enforcement agencies for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in I.V. Earvin marked that demand six has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p>The university is unable to meet demand eight for increased lighting on Slough Road because the Coastal Commission will not approve the change in infrastructure, according to Klawunn.</p>\n<p>Demand nine, to organize a meeting with all UC Chancellors on our UC Santa Barbara campus to develop system-wide level change, was not met “the way the demand is written,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>A UC-level sexual assault policy training review was held in September.</p>\n<p>Demand 11 asked the UC president to conduct yearly campus tours, where they should hold a public sexual violence town hall at every UC campus once per year.</p>\n<p>Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, will instead hold a town hall at UCSB on Jan. 8.</p>\n<p>Demand 12 requested Chancellor Yang and his office regularly update students about the progress being made on these demands. Klawunn said the demand was incomplete and said Tuesday’s town hall was one way to update the public.</p>\n<p>After the panel discussed their progress on each of the 12 demands, the floor became open for the approximately 30 students present to ask questions. The panel also answered anonymously submitted questions.</p>\n<p>Attendees asked why the UC administration has the funds for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/\">Halloween ads</a> but not to meet the 12 demands. Others asked whether programs like Gaucho FYI and Haven are enough to combat rape culture.</p>\n<p>The public made suggestions to the panel regarding addressing rape culture at places like the Student Leadership Retreat, where many leaders of organizations gather for training each year.</p>\n<p>They also mentioned the newly-introduced UC Title IX Student Advisory Board and asked if the students chosen to serve on this board would be compensated for the time commitment required to be on the board.</p>\n<p>Armistead agreed that students who serve on the board should be compensated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>The board will consist of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve.

(S.A.N.) at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2016. At the time, he was prepared to organize social justice movements under a Clinton presidency.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump won the election, Villalobos had to change his plans.</p>\n<p>“I threw myself more into S.A.N. It’s like a full time job for me,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is a student-run social justice organization that organizes demonstrations and protests for racial justice, gender equality, immigration, workers’ rights and other issues</p>\n<p>Since Election Day 2016, the network has organized and participated in several on-campus and local demonstrations, including protests after election day, a May Day rally for laborer rights, a rally against rape culture and a sit-in at Cheadle Hall with Fossil Free UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mayela Morales, a fourth-year Chican@ studies and global studies double major, is the head organizer of S.A.N. She became involved in student activism when she started taking Chican@ studies courses at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The biggest change Morales has witnessed in the U.S. since Trump became president is an increase in outward racism throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s policies, like the administration’s travel ban in March and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, have spurred racist rhetoric and sentiments.</p>\n<p>“It always comes back to targeting a community in particular,” she said. “Racism has become more blunt — it’s just straight up in your face.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a more organized racism and misogyny,” Villalobos said, agreeing with Morales. “It’s here, it’s present and we’ll organize against it.”</p>\n<p>Racial justice is one of the Student Activist Network’s seven key issues, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The group has an organized a caucus for each of the seven issues: racial justice, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, the environment, workers’ rights and student movements.</p>\n<p>Morales said many of the caucuses have organized projects in direct relation to the Trump administration’s policies, including Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s repeal of Obama-era Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>The feminist caucus, for example, is collaborating with Ro Earvin, a UCSB student who presented a list of demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang in May to reform how the university handles sexual violence.</p>\n<p>S.A.N. is also working to create anti-war and anti-police caucuses, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Student Activist Network printed 500 copies of its “Disorientation Guide,” a booklet that contains historical information about student movements and activism at UCSB, as well as information on labor unions and housing cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“When you come to the university, you get an orientation packet,” Villalobos said. “This is the same thing except it’s from a radical perspective. This shows students [UCSB] is not just a place where you go to class, get your degree and leave.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said the “Disorientation Guide” will helps students understand the impact students have made on UCSB’s history and know how to better organize against oppression today.</p>\n<p>“When I started S.A.N., it was a piece of beat-up notebook paper,” Villalobos said, reflecting on how much the organization and its structure have changed in the past year.</p>\n<p>Today, the group has a head organizer, an internal organizer, treasurer, a meeting facilitator and a central organizing committee.</p>\n<p>The network also holds core organizing meetings, during which the board discusses long term plans, and general body meetings, in which all caucuses meet together to work on their projects.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is open to anyone interested in joining<strong>, </strong>Villalobos said, which is an aspect of the organization he believes makes it unique on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re a radical student group, but we accept everyone,” he said, adding that without limits based on political affiliation or identity, the network is able to address a variety of social issues that affect different groups.</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said the Student Activist Network wants to educate more incoming students about the history of movement-based activism and getting involved.</p>\n<p>“The university is a site of struggle, and historically there’s been a lot of action,” he said.</p>\n<p>Villalobos, who will graduate at the end of Fall Quarter, said he wants to keep students engaged with movement-based politics even after the Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>While the Trump administration has inspired more people to become activists, Villalobos said, movements against racism, transphobia, misogyny and gender inequality have always existed.</p>\n<p>“There’s the resistance to all these things that have existed before [Trump] and will exist afterwards,” he added. “They have to be resisted either way.”</p>\n<p>As the Student Activist Network looks toward the future, Villalobos said it is important for students to remain resilient and dedicated to social justice even after Trump leaves office.</p>\n<p>“The message has been like the Democrats aren’t going to save you, the elections aren’t going to save you necessarily,” he said. “We have to save ourselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
