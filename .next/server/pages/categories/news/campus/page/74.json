Finance and Business Committee convened in the State St. room in the UCen on Monday. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room in the UCen on Monday evening to listen to and grant funding requests to various student organizations.</p>\n<p>Three groups received full funding before the Board lost forum due to an inadequate number of members and continued in discussion over what they would decide to fund when the Board met again. Groups that received full funding included El Congreso, receiving $10,000 for their Raza College Rally, the Japanese Language Café receiving $250 and finally Chicano/Chicana Grads, which received $14,077 to hold an alternative graduation for Latino/Latina students. Cotillion Dance’s request for $150 for a non-dance social at the Student Resources Building was tabled after representatives for the club failed to show up to the meeting. The other groups will now wait to hear back from the Board and will receive responses to their funding requests when the A.S. Senate meets this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Student comedy group Laughology requested $6,510 for their six upcoming shows after explaining that they had an impressive lineup including Dana Gould, a writer for the Simpsons, and Grammy Award winning comic Tig Notaro.</p>\n<p>“Winter quarter is historically slow for just about everything. It’s really hard to get people to come in — not true for us,” a spokesperson for the club said. “It seems like we are on a bit of a snowball effect here and we’ve got a really crazy order of comedians lined up. It is probably the best quarter we have ever booked.”</p>\n<p>The American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE), a student association of chemical engineering students, asked for $842 for funding for an annual Southern California regional mixer that will be open to all students on campus at all year levels.</p>\n<p>The event will feature AIChE representatives from six universities and 80 chapters, according to AIChE Internal Vice President and third-year chemical engineering major Dilpreet Kaur.</p>\n<p>“Specifically right now, it is a very important for us to go because our current president is resigning due to personal issues and we have two other people stepping up in leadership,” Kaur said. “This conference will give a great opportunity for them to talk to other leaders and the other organizations and see how we can complete our events for this year and get advice on running our chapter.”</p>\n<p>The Lindy Circle, a Goleta-based dance organization, came to request $2,632 for a dancing event with a band they have every quarter. Representatives for the club said this year’s event will feature a premier swing dance act led by jazz guitarist Jonathan Stout.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Ensemble Troupe, a women’s student theatre organization on campus, requested $3,000 to put on the Vagina Monologues, an ensemble performance play featuring women’s personal perspectives on love, sex, rape, gender and other issues, held each Winter quarter. In addition, the Muslim Student Association requested an additional $284 for transportation to an upcoming MSA conference at UCLA. The Chinese Students and Scholars Association also requested to re-allocate $324, the Women’s Ensemble requested $3,000, literary arts magazine the Catalyst requested $4,759, Laughology requested $6510, the Lindy Circle requested $2,632 and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers requested $842.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59683\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59683\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/","id":2946,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2945,2944,2943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

A.S. Executive Director Maricela Marquez also spoke briefly about concerns surrounding last November’s Mac DeMarco concert, during which police apprehended the artist after he climbed the rafters of The Hub.</p>\n<p>Marquez announced efforts to establish better communication between UC Police Department and the A.S. Program Board, which put on the concert, in order to prevent future mistakes on the part of security personnel including the chief of police for UCPD and Program Board officials.</p>\n<p>“We sent a general memo to all those personnel to see if we could do some cross-training about how things work and what impact one of our decisions make on others and so on and so forth,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy was present at the meeting to inform the Senate about a possible I.V. rebranding project and potential university-sponsored events to be held during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Guthy questioned whether a rebranding campaign is necessary and if money raised for such a campaign could be better spent on investing in certain I.V. programs.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, I.V.S.A.F.E., a committee on I.V. safety led Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley, is currently working on a rebranding initiative for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Today they proposed that this campaign would cost somewhere in the realm of $90,000 so they’re looking into where they would get those sources of funding,” Guthy said, “I expressed concern over whether students would rather see that money going toward actually creating programs to benefit I.V. rather than tell the world that it is better. So we’re not really sure where we will be going with that.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said university administration is examining potential alternative entertainment programming, similar to what was held during Halloween, for this year’s Deltopia, an event typically held the first weekend of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The university has reserved a lot of campus venues like Harder Stadium and Campbell Hall for alternative programming that weekend and I think A.S. Program Board is looking into hosting some sort of concert or alternative event similar to Halloween,” Guthy said. “Nothing’s been set yet but plans have been developed.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said he encouraged off-campus senators to attend town hall meetings organized by California State Assemblyman for Santa Barbara Das Williams, to discuss efforts toward I.V. self-governance. Schunk also said the first of these meetings for Winter Quarter is scheduled to take place Feb. 5, followed by subsequent meetings on the Feb. 15 and March 5.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said he would like to see expanded service offering by the A.S. Pardall Center, including the purchase of its current building, which A.S. leases, to create a more permanent A.S. presence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to look into the idea of the Associated Students being able to increase and expand the services provided in the Pardall Center, specifically through an increase in fee initiative,” Schunk said. “One of the main things we would be looking to do is provide the opportunity for the Associated Students to also use that funding in the long term to perhaps purchase that building so that we no longer have to worry about renting that space.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed its only action item of the week, “A Resolution to Support Wage Equality Among UC Employees” without objection, which voices the Senate’s support for equal salaries for staff regardless of gender.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appears on page 4 of the Thursday, January 8, 2015 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/","id":2527,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2526,2525,2524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate and meets weekly on Mondays to allocate funding to various student groups and other university affiliated projects. At the meeting, the board addressed finance requests and funded GIVE to Isla Vista, the Muslim Student Association, Model United Nations (MUN) and Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU) among others. </p>\n<p>South Asian student group UCSB Indus requested $2,280 to fund a cultural dance and a cappella concert in mid-February as part of campus-wide cultural awareness week and was granted $1,880 of the request. </p>\n<p>The International Student Association also requested $1,564 to fund their “Welcome Back” concert in the Hub this Friday evening and was granted the full amount.</p>\n<p>GIVE to Isla Vista is an event held at the end of each academic year where donated student items from students moving out of I.V. in June are sold to the general public in a fundraising event for which the organization gives volunteers to staff the event. The event last year drew over 50 tons of merchandise and provided money to over a dozen student organizations. Of the requested $11,085, the board agreed to fund the group $8,766 to cover costs for a site coordinator, a volunteer coordinator, site clothing and a truck driver.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association requested $1,062 for tickets and transportation to attend the 2015 MSA West Conference in mid-January, where MSA chapters from California, Arizona and Nevada will meet for three days to discuss relevant issues related to Muslim identity and collective history. The board passed a motion to fully fund the requested amount and to withdraw $230 in money previously allocated to the group last November.</p>\n<p>MUN requested a total of $25,294 for their upcoming events in spring quarter. The board decided to move $517 from the Office of Student Life spring account into an account for Academic teams, and to allocate $5,000 towards hotel fees for MUN. </p>\n<p>Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU), an organization representing the Salvadoran student community, is holding a two-day annual summit that will include workshops and team building activities for groups from chapters at other campuses. The group requested a total of $1,022 of which $946 was allocated to be spent on muffins, orange juice, coffee, water and other assorted foods and utensils. </p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, 50 percent of the foods purchased can be from Costco, but the other 50 percent need to be purchased from local or organic sources. </p>\n<p>“That’s what you all are supposed to tell them during the finance and business workshops,” Lau said. “You say, ‘You still have to use organic foods,’ and they’ll say, ‘Oh, we’re getting our food from Costco, what about them?’ You still have to have 50 percent of it be USDA organic, local.” </p>\n<p>Lau said that although the Isla Vista Food Co-op is an option for students to buy organic food, it is not necessary to purchase food there. </p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be from the Co-op,” Lau said. “The Co-op is automatically local and organic, but you can get it from Costco and have it be organic.” </p>\n<p>The Board also passed a motion to fully fund USEU as a one-time exception for the food costs and plan to emphasize spending restrictions in future finance and business workshops. </p>\n<p>Other fully funded groups include the professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi; the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department for their 11th-annual Graduate Student Symposium; the Indus organization for their cultural show; and the International Student Association for their welcome back concert this Friday. Recreational computer hacking group SB Hacks also requested $2,000 to help fund an upcoming “hackathon” that promises to draw some 500-600 participants, the motion to fund was tabled indefinitely.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/","id":2590,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2589,2588,2587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Professor Dies Over Winter Break","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"74-year-old materials professor Edward Kramer (far right) died in his sleep at his home in Santa Barbara on the morning of Dec 27.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59415\" style=\"width: 336px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"463889733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59415\" data-attachment-id=\"59415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\\u00a9UCSB Photographic Services\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image-683x1024.jpg?resize=326%2C490\" alt=\"Materials professor Edward Kramer died on the morning of Dec 27.

He had been a professor at UCSB with the department of materials and jointly with the chemical engineering department since 1997. <em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Public Affairs &amp; Communications</em></p></div>\n<p>75-year-old materials professor Edward Kramer died in his sleep at his home in Santa Barbara on the morning of Dec 27.</p>\n<p>Kramer had been a professor at the university with the department of materials and jointly with the chemical engineering department since 1997, when he was recruited out of a 30-year career in materials science at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Kramer is survived by his wife, Gail, their children Jeanne and Eric his grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Kramer graduated from Cornell University in 1962 with a Bachelors in chemical engineering and earned a Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1966. He joined the faculty of Cornell University in 1967 and in 1973 authored a paper that greatly expanded current knowledge on a phenomenon called flux pinning, where exceptionally conductive materials are suspended in space above a magnet. While at UCSB, Kramer worked collaboratively with various professors, post-doctoral scholars and Ph.D. candidates, particularly in the area of polymer science, in which he was considered an expert.</p>\n<p>Rod C. Alferness, Dean of the College of Engineering, said the death of Kramer was unexpected despite a recent heart surgery.</p>\n<p>“Its a huge loss,” Alferness said. “It came as a shock; I was not expecting it to happen at this time. There’s a sense of loss both for the college and the university.”</p>\n<p>Kramer’s longtime colleague, chemical engineering professor Glenn Fredrickson, said while Kramer’s heart surgery had taken place several months ago and he was in recovery, Kramer had been active in the research lab and had attended the dissertation defense of two of his Ph.D. students just a week prior to his death.</p>\n<p>“He had been very active and animated during the discussion and questioning period, so we had a sense that he was on the mend and was his old self,” Fredrickson said. “Everybody who had interacted with him just a week ago had a sense that it was all uphill from there, we were really taken aback by this.”</p>\n<p>According to Materials Dept. chair Tresa Pollock, Kramer was a devoted faculty member who took pride in the achievements of the students he mentored.</p>\n<p>“He was a very dedicated teacher and mentor,” Pollock said.“He put a tremendous amount of effort into developing his courses and teaching them carefully.”</p>\n<p>Kramer was set to teach an undergraduate course this quarter in the chemical engineering department, Introduction to Polymer Science, which Pollock said would be filled by Rachel Segalman, a former student and colleague of Kramer at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>According to Alferness, Kramer was planning to retire from his faculty position at the end of the year and would not have taken on any new graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, but would have remained with the university as a researcher.</p>\n<p>Alferness also said Kramer was a role model for younger faculty and mentioned that Kramer and his wife donated enough money to the university to establish an endowed chair position that has yet to be filled within the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“He was a great citizen on campus as well and a strong advocate for UCSB. A very wise person. Everyone will tell you who knows him, he was truly a gentleman and served as a wonderful mentor,” Alferness said. “[Establishing an endowed chair] is not a typical thing for faculty to do; it speaks to his view of the importance of education.”</p>\n<p>Kramer also led the Kramer/Fredrickson research group within the Materials Research Laboratory. The group’s research primarily focused on studying certain properties of block copolymers, materials made up of block-like structures of multiple molecules. Specifically, the group’s recent research has centered on understanding the processes by which certain materials melt, as well as the process of directed self-assembly. According to the Institute for Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, directed self-assembly is a process by which molecules of certain materials spontaneously come together, or “self-assemble”.</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, a longtime collaborator of Kramer’s, Kramer was among the first to develop the field of examining directed self-assembly and did some of the early experimentation on the process and that Fredrickson used his work in a theoretical research group in materials research.</p>\n<p>“He did a lot the early pioneering work on directed self assembly … and looking at how polymers assemble themselves in confined ‘wells’ within a thin film,” Fredrickson said. “My group has subsequently developed theoretical tools for simulating polymers under confinement and much of that was simulated by experimental work [from] his group.”</p>\n<p>Fredrickson also said Kramer’s work on the directed self-assembly processes represents an advancement in the way certain products are manufactured.</p>\n<p>“Now its become [a] technology that companies like Intel and Sony viewing it as a strategy for next generation patterning of semi-conductor devices,” Fredrickson said. “Being able to make smaller features on devices than they currently can now, the strategy for making microprocessors faster is to shrink the devices and that requires patterning on smaller and smaller length scales.”</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, Kramer was one of the first people to work on the process in a “methodical, systematic experimental way” that has set the stage for it to become a “developing technology.”</p>\n<p>According to Nate Lynd, an assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at University of Texas, Austin, and formerly a post-doctoral researcher under Kramer at UCSB, the late professor’s work with the group was unique given his level of involvement in the group’s work.</p>\n<p>“Ed very much liked to be involved,” Lynd said. “You would sometimes see the light on in his office in the evening he would be working on data himself which I think is somewhat rare for a professor this late in his career.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Kramer’s contributions to materials science are “legendary”.</p>\n<p>“He helped to elevate the stature of our university and our top-ranked Materials and Chemical Engineering departments, and provided exemplary leadership and service to our campus community in so many other ways as well, including co-chairing the search advisory committees for our previous and current Dean of Engineering,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Lynd also said Kramer fostered an atmosphere of collaboration in the various research efforts he took part in and various faculty members and departments would be involved in the polymer research Kramer carried out.</p>\n<p>“What was really great about Ed’s group was just how well integrated it was with the research efforts others, with the research of other faculty at UCSB,” Lynd said. “It was this incorporation of the contributions of the expertise of many people that had made a lot of this research great and Ed. This was his modus operandi, and he was a big cheerleader of carrying out collaborative research.”</p>\n<p>Lynd said Kramer aided him greatly in his postdoctoral studies and taught him to work collaboratively with others in the group.</p>\n<p>“Recognizing what kind of peg you are and finding the right hole on the team, that’s something Ed definitely helped me with,” Lynd said, “and since that time things went just great … I really owe a lot to Ed.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Kramer’s age as 74, he was actually 75. The article also incorrectly described the directed self-assembly process as spontaneous, it actually occurs in controlled environments under the influence of researchers. The article also incorrectly stated Fredrickson used Kramer’s scholarship in his own work, this is also incorrect, Fredrickson used his work in a collaborative theoretical research group composed of graduate students and other researchers. This article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Materials professor and recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics Shuji Nakamura was named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) on Dec 16.</p>\n<p>Nakamura will be inducted into NAI on March 20, along with 170 other newly named NAI fellows, as part of the 4th Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where fellows will be awarded trophies, medals and rosette pins. The NAI is a non-profit organization with 414 fellows, collectively holding nearly 14,000 U.S. patents and representing over 150 institutions, and it serves to recognize inventors who hold U.S. Patents. Nominees must be named inventors on at least one patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are chosen by their peers and then later approved by a selection committee.</p>\n<p>Nakamura said in an email that he credits the NAI honor to his invention of the energy efficient blue light emitting diode (LED) and blue laser diodes, for which he was recently also awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Nakmura also said his inspiration for his work comes from a deep examination of the world around him.</p>\n<p>“I like to think about anything deeply to understand the mechanism behind the scene,” Nakamura said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI President, founder and AAAS-Lemelson Invention Ambassador Paul R. Sanberg said designation as a fellow is the only high-level national honor specifically available to academic inventors.</p>\n<p>“The NAI fellows are prolific innovators whose discoveries and inventions have fostered new ideas, products and companies that benefit their institutions and communities and are making an impact on society,” Sanberg said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI Vice President George Newkome, who himself holds 45 patents and has published 450 scientific papers, said Nakamura’s fellowship will lead the way for more faculty at the university to become NAI fellows in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that professor Nakamura was chosen to be a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors it is a true honor to be part of NAI and I am sure that many others from UCSB will be following in his footsteps,” Newkome said in an email.</p>\n<p>Two other faculty are also NAI fellows — Materials Professor and Co-Director of UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) Steven DenBaars and Chemical Engineering professor and Founding Director of the Center for Bioengineering Samir Mitragotri.</p>\n<p>According to DenBaars, Nakamura’s fellowship further reinforces his position as a world renown innovator and highlights the widely impactful effect he has made globally with his innvention of the LED.</p>\n<p>“As a colleague and co-director of SSLEEC I am delighted that Shuji Nakamura is a new NAI Fellow,” DenBaars said in an email. “This is a strong endorsement of Shuji inventions and patents he has filed since coming to UCSB 14 years ago. This is indicative of Shuji’s innovative research and world-leading status of UCSB’s materials department.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitragotri, Nakamura’s election to the NIA is a significant recognition of his accomplishments in physics and materials science.</p>\n<p>“In addition to celebrating innovation, NAI enables the fellow to collectively think about some of the important aspects of promoting and sustaining academic innovation,” Mitragotri said in an email. “Shuji has made some of the most significant inventions of our generation. His election to NAI recognizes his accomplishments.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

<em>Photo courtesy of news.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>Professor of Physics and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics member Joe Polchinksi gave the annual Faculty Research Lecture Thursday night after being selected as the Faculty Research Lecturer in May, an honor that recognizes extraordinary scholarly distinction and contribution to the campus and community.</p>\n<p>Polchinski has received a number of awards for his contributions to fundamental physics, including the Physics Frontiers Prize from the Milner Foundation, which was given for his work involving quantum field theory and string theory, as well as the discovery of D-branes, structures that have been shown to provide the atomic structure of black holes. Polchinski’s lecture explored black holes and spoke of the search for a unified theory of the laws of physics along with the difficulty of connecting two main theories — quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s research focuses especially on quantum field theory, which is the basic mathematical language of particle physics. It also focuses on string theory, a proposed unified theory of all the laws of physics in which all particles are tiny vibrating strings.</p>\n<p>“In quantum field theory, I have clarified some of the important ideas, by explaining how they follow from simple principles,” Polchinski said in an email. “In string theory, I am best known for showing that the theory could not be complete, that besides strings it requires other objects that we call branes. I also have proposed an explanation of the dark energy discovered by astronomers.”</p>\n<p>According to Polchinski, his research has been aided by his ability to comprehend both the concepts of physics and the mathematics that accompany his form of research.</p>\n<p>“Probably most of my discoveries have come by taking some interesting mathematical result in physics, and understanding what is the physical principle that explains it,” Polchinski said in an email. “I think my best tool is the ability to translate back and forth between equations and physics.”</p>\n<p>Polchinski said thought experiments with black holes have led to some surprising discoveries: black hole bits, the holographic principle and Maldacena’s duality. He also said he hopes his new thought experiments will result in greater theoretical understanding of quantum gravity.</p>\n<p>“The latest thought experiment presents new challenges, and we can hope that it will lead us to a more complete theory of quantum gravity,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s contributions to theoretical physics include a modern formulation of renormalization theory and original work on the string landscape. Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Polchinski is exceptional both for his scientific achievements and for his ability to simplify concepts for a broader audience.</p>\n<p>“As one of the pioneers of string theory, he has demonstrated tremendous creativity and insight, not only in discovering new scientific truths, but also in communicating these complex ideas in a highly accessible and inspiring way,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Washington State University alumnae Wanda Johnsen attended Polchinski’s lecture and said she was inspired by how Polchinski reinstated the idea that there are still many things to discover and that there are no limitations to the universe.</p>\n<p>“The lecture gave some answers about the infinity of the universe,” said Johnsen. “Who knows what is the beginning, where is the end, and how all universes are expanding. It brings a new idea about the lack of limitations.”</p>\n<p>Polchinkski said that while new discoveries have been made in the field of physics, there is still much more to learn.</p>\n<p>“I hope they got the idea that there are some big questions about the nature of space and other things, that we have some new and exciting ideas about,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>According to Professor emeritus of mathematics Eugene Johnsen, the lecture provided any member of the audience who is interested in science a basic understanding of Polchinski’s complex research.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things I took away from tonight was some of the connections between quantum mechanics, general relativity, special relativity and all of the issues that came up within that topic: the paradoxes, the questions and the present state of affairs,” Johnsen said. “[His lecture] will motivate future scientists and future physicists to pursue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/","id":2501,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[2500,2499,2498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Womyn’s Commission appealed to reallocate over $5,000 in funds previously set aside for travel. Several funding measures were also passed, including Off-Campus Senators’ request to receive $100 for fliers and food for a forum this Friday as well as the Black Student Union’s request for $250 for the Black Coalition Conference’s registration fees and $1,035 for hotel costs for a group of 60 people.</p>\n<p>A member of the Excursion Club asked for a reallocation of funds, as the club wanted to put the $950 received last week to instead pay $100 each for the bands Sun Daes and Yancellor Chang as well as $750 for their equipment.</p>\n<p>“Once we realized what funding we would be getting from the Board we talked to the bands and they all need equipment, but we didn’t get any funding for equipment,” the Excursion Club member said. “It is pretty vital to our event because we really need the lighting to make it a safe event and the generators power the lights.”</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Cafe asked for $420 for three events which are open to the public: a $100 karaoke potluck on Dec. 4 in the Multicultural Center Lounge, a $160 Winter BBQ at Goleta Beach on Jan 16 and a $160 Spring BBQ at Goleta Beach on April 11.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe President Eric Lee said the karaoke potluck would be a great final event for students graduating or returning home.</p>\n<p>“We think that it’s a great chance for everyone to get together and exchange cultures and many times at the end of the quarter some people are graduating or going back to Japan,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance and Business Committee Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said the committee was unable to fund the event, as the club has already been funded for an off-campus event for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We can’t fund you at all for your Goleta Beach events because you have used your one time exception for an off-campus event,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>Lee said the club would then only request $100 for the potluck this Thursday, but the committee said they would not fund the club’s potluck and suggested the club try to find place on campus for their other two events.</p>\n<p>Theus said the students should relocate the event in order to receive funding.</p>\n<p>“If you had it here on campus we could fund you for those two events,” Theus said, “so you can come back again because we can’t fund you for the rest of this quarter. Change from Goleta Beach to on campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the A.S. Womyn’s Commission Danielle Maldonado requested successfully that the committee approve the transfer of their $5,740 travel budget to special projects.</p>\n<p>“It has always been there, but we haven’t ever used any of it yet and I’m still leaving money in there in case it ever is needed,” Maldonado said. “The only conference that we’ve considered going to is UC Berkeley’s Empowering Women of Color, and it is during our finals week, so that’s really the only conference we wanted to go to. We have been looking this year but we haven’t found any.”</p>\n<p>Co-Presidents of the Art Club Janice Agustin and Lucy Maybank asked for $700 for the Honors’ Art Show this upcoming Spring and $1,050 for the Undergraduate Art Show in June 2015, stating they had not received funding from the university Art Department.</p>\n<p>Senator Esteni Dominguez explained the budget breakdown for the Art Club’s request to other Senators.</p>\n<p>“They are just asking for food, music and materials to put up and put down artwork,” Dominguez said, “The only reason why the second event is more is because they’re expecting double the amount of people coming for the second show.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Committee met yesterday evening at the State Street Room in the UCen to hear requests from 18 student organizations for funding.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, the committee decided to fully fund 12 organizations, did not fund one request, tabled two requests and partially funded three requests. Discussion items included the introduction and approval of a new process for distributing honoraria, or monetary compensation, for Program Board officers. Other discussion items included honoraria bill for the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE) that was tabled indefinitely for consideration by the honoraria committee, and a bill to further availability and access of information in A.S. elections code, which was passed.</p>\n<p>Requests granted by the committee included $450 to the University Affairs Committee for honoraria for three student members, $250 for the External Affairs Committee, $75 for the On Campus Senator’s event focused on healthy, productive study foods from the Isla Vista Co-op, $10,550 for the Black Graduates group, $3,840 for La Famille de Colores for tickets and flights for an upcoming conference, $4,000 for the Impact Movement’s national conference in Chicago, $147 for Vocal Motion a cappella group’s fall concert, $80 for Delta Sigma Zeta’s scantrons and bluebooks for a group study session, $400 for the Catalyst Literary Art Magazine third issue launch party, specifically for publicity purposes, to provide propane to keep their upcoming event area warm as well as to provide sculpture transportation.</p>\n<p>The Asian American Christian group EPIC requested and was approved to receive $3,000 for an annual conference held in Orange County at the Doubletree Hotel.<br>\nOfficer for EPIC and fourth-year student Esther Euseon said they needed funding because of their particularly large group this year.</p>\n<p>“We are actually, this year, the largest Christian Asian-American organization on campus,” Euseon said. “We love it when anybody comes to our events.”</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee member and second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said EPIC is very inclusive as a Christian organization, unlike other religious groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“”I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian, in that sense I am Catholic, and honestly they’re pretty chill,” Garcia said. “When organizations say ‘Oh yeah we’re very inclusive,’ it’s hard for people to think they can get into those spaces, but I think with specifically religious organizations they try to make it so they’re as inclusiveness possible.”</p>\n<p>The Art Club requested money for two different events, totaling $1,750, but both were tabled. Representatives from the club will attempt to get money from the Art Department before re-requesting from the Finance Board.</p>\n<p>The Cheer Team also received funding for registration as well as lodging for the USA Nationals competition in Anaheim and a separate competition in Atlanta. The delegated amount was $2,750 out of the $16,780 the team had requested for transportation for future cheer competitions.</p>\n<p>One of Cheer Team’s captains and third-year film and media studies major Nick Gorton-Bufano said this is the first time since 2003 that the team has had both females and males.</p>\n<p>“This is the first year that we’ve been coed since 2003, so that’s cool,” Gorton-Bufano said. “And we gained a lot of support at basketball games from people because we’re co-ed. So we are trying to grow the co-ed aspect as well.”</p>\n<p>Model United Nations also requested $7,332 for extra transportation and housing for their annual Berkeley conference, and received $1,426 to pay for registration fees.</p>\n<p>UCen UStudy, a service that keeps the UCen open for longer than average hours during finals week, received $700 of the $1,085 they asked for to pay for building management to keep Corwin Pavilion open from 1 a.m. – 6 a.m. and to pay for a massage therapist.

Student a-cappella group InterVals opened the rally with a performance, followed by speeches by CARE staff members Hannah Brown and Emily Potter on the social complexities of sexual violence and how the university can take action to prevent sexual abuse. They were joined by co-chair of Take Back the Night Gema Hernandez, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and California Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson staff member Liora Goodman.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Hannah Brown, a CARE staff member and one of the main organizers of the event, said she wants the campaign to inform students about what CARE can do for those who have been sexually assaulted or for those who know someone who has been a victim of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Our main message for survivors is that we want to create an environment that’s accepting and not shameful,” Brown said. “We want survivors to know that they aren’t alone and we are here to support them. As for people who aren’t survivors – if you see something we hope you will step in and protect your friends and people you see on the street.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year sociology major and event organizer Emily Potter, the university officially registered with the It’s On Us campaign last month and said while the CARE program has been addressing college sexual assault for years, the issue itself is getting more substantial attention nationally.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been trying to raise awareness of the issues surrounding sexual assault for years and I think it’s finally, nationally, getting the attention it deserves,” Potter said. “Nothing groundbreaking, but it’s picking up.”</p>\n<p>Potter said people have a difficult time believing victims of sexual assault, which leaves victims feeling insecure and unsupported.</p>\n<p>“I was raped when I was 15,” Potter said. “The first person I told said to me ‘Don’t even pull that shit on me when you admit that you had sex.’ That was when the seed of doubt was planted in me.”</p>\n<p>Brown said she believes the event was a success considering the large participation CARE saw throughout the week.</p>\n<p>“I think people are standing up and saying ‘Hey, this is something I really want to support,’” Brown said. “Especially because we’ve been doing our pledge drive this week and tons of people – hundreds of people – have come in and signed our pledge. It’s really great to see the support from all the students once they’ve seen what the issue is.”</p>\n<p>According to Potter, who opened her speech with the It’s On Us pledge, the campaign is important in light of the lack of support society gives survivors.</p>\n<p>“I pledge to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported,” Potter said. “Currently we do not have that environment. For some reason, we seem to find it easier to believe the perpetrator over the survivor.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film major Timmy Linetsky attended the It’s On Us rally and said he was proud of the speakers and campaign organizers for sharing their stories and advice.</p>\n<p>“I thought some of the stories people shared were really brave,” Linetsky said. “My best friend gave a speech today and I thought that was incredible.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>CORRECTION</strong>: A previous version of this article switched Emily Potter and Hannah Brown’s quotes, attributing Brown’s quotes to Potter’s and Potter’s quotes to Brown.

The talk was sponsored by the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at UCSB, and was free to the public. Barnes has written various books on the economy, including <em>Who Owns the Sky, Capitalism 3.0</em> and <em>With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough.</em></p>\n<p>Barnes said he believes in fixing capitalism rather than destroying it and that solutions to reforming capitalism boil involve addressing capitalism’s two “tragic” flaws.  </p>\n<p>“The relentless destruction of nature and the equally relentless widening of inequality,” Barnes said. “These flaws are coded into the system. If we want to change them we have to change the system itself, and it’s not enough to fiddle at the edges.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnes, reforming capitalism is an urgent affair that must be addressed on a systematic level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have any time left to fiddle at the edges,” Barnes said. “We have to get to the fundamental systematic roots of these flaws and fix them.”</p>\n<p>Barnes also said capitalism’s flaws can be addressed by arguing against the idea that “the commons,” or community owned resources, are inherently self-destructive. This idea was originally proposed by late UCSB human ecology professor Garrett Hardin, according to Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The commons is not the perpetrator of tragedy but rather the victim and capitalism’s tragic flaws are the actual perpetrators, and that the commons, or what I now prefer to call common wealth, is actually a key part of the solution to the flaws of capitalism,” Barnes said.  </p>\n<p>According to Barnes, in order to fix the “deepest flaws of capitalism,” individuals need to “reclaim the commons,” or common wealth, by organizing and managing the commons on the basis of common ownership, common trustee ship and common benefit. Barnes also said he encouraged audience members to prepare for “the next crisis” by sharing his ideas regarding the commonwealth in writing and online. </p>\n<p>“Start saying things like, ‘The air belongs to all of us,’ or ‘Our money belongs to all of us. Our monetary system belongs to all of us. And they are taking it from us and we have a right to take it back.’” Barnes said. “Start naming common wealth and claiming it. If we do that I do believe that after the next crisis, we can fix the tragic flaws of capitalism.”<br>\n <br>\nEvent organizer and philosophy professor Gregory Jarrett said Barnes’ talk relates to one of his classes on environmental ethics. </p>\n<p>“This is relevant to my class on environmental ethics, but also as you will hear it is part of our mission to bring in other classes,” Jarrett said.  “They are also very excited, they are also talking about the same kind of things in different compartments, and this is our opportunity to get things together.”</p>\n<p>Students in Jarrett’s Environmental Ethics class, professor Robert Wilkinson’s Sustainable Communities, professor Philip McCarty’s Global Economic Development and his Global Studies 1 class were attendance at the lecture.    </p>\n<p>Jarrett said the event aims to bring together students with different majors to listen and talk with Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The goal is to get the students from different disciplines together in the same room not only hear him talk,” Jarrett said.  “But there will be a 30 minute Q and A so they get an opportunity to interact with a speaker like this.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year religious studies and physical geography double major Harlowe Wang said she enjoyed listening to Barnes’ ideas, but also does not see how they could be applied to the real world.</p>\n<p> “I think he was extending human stakeholders that are alive now too far to future generations and to non-human stakeholders,” Wang said.  “I thought his idea was amazing and I think it was very interesting and thought provoking [but] I wished he had spoken more to the actual feasibility and politics of it, because what I’ve taken away from is that its a really great idea … but I still don’t see how it would been implemented.”</p>\n<p>Following the lecture and question and answer segment, there was a book signing of Barnes’ With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough, which was available for purchase at the talk. </p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/","id":2959,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2958,2957,2956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The Student Affairs Committee also listened to reports from the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) about a bill to create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students.</p>\n<p>The SFAC chair and fourth-year economics and accounting major Sean McKenzie said their group is separate from A.S. and is composed of 12 voting members, including two sophomores, two juniors, two seniors, two grad reps, two faculty and two staff representatives.</p>\n<p>“We are a committee under the Student Affairs Department, so we have nothing to do with Associated Students at all, even though we have Associated Students as our Ex-Officio Advisory members,” McKenzie said.</p>\n<p>According to McKenzie, the SFAC hears out public requests for departments for one-time projects such as maintenance requests, student health requests and more.</p>\n<p>“In Fall we open up public requests for those departments like the MultiCultural Center, the Rec Center, CAPS — there’s a whole list on our website actually,” McKenzie said. “So they come in [and] in the Fall they request money from us. We have a pot every year of money — it’s $285,000 each year, that’s based on a percentage of the student services fee. So based on that money, the Committee will allocate to these departments based on if they see fit whether they are going to improve the student life basically.”</p>\n<p>McKenzie also said all UC’s have a SFAC, and they meet up at various locations every quarter to work on campaigns.</p>\n<p>The Chair of the Senate Affairs Committee and second-year political science major Cassandra Mancini said SHAC had a meeting last Tuesday discussing the new meningitis vaccine, which would require three shots.</p>\n<p>“Last year, 50 percent of the student body got both shots, so that’s pretty cool. We’re very protected against Meningitis,” Mancini said. “But this new vaccine is not recommended — or you don’t have to get it if you got last year’s one — but, it would be good for new students and transfer students to get. So we will be offering that.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the new vaccine will cost money, but the amount is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>“It’ll just be in the Student Health Office, so anyone can get it at any time — it’s also not free like it was last year,” Mancini said. “They didn’t mention how much it costs. But also, I don’t know if insurance will cover it until next year, so that’s something that we might have to start talking about pretty soon.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the cost of getting the flu shot is rising, and there will be an official meeting on Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The costs of flu shots is being increased from $20-$30 for non-Gaucho Health Insurance people, and we talked about whether that was prohibitive or not,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the distance criteria will be extended to approximately 50 miles next year in order to include students who have Kaiser health insurance, which is currently not a sufficient alternative health care providers according to current GHI stantards, though MediCal students would still be denied.</p>\n<p>“Kaiser students can easily get waived,” Mancini said. “So that will be great for students because that was a big issue this year. Us and Santa Cruz are the only UC’s that didn’t have a Kaiser within a close distance.”</p>\n<p>FEC student representative and fourth year student Nikka Kurland said the Faculty Committee’s responsibilities include collecting information from end-of-the-quarter course assessments.</p>\n<p>“They review self-assessments from different departments and kind of like approve name changes [of] the department names like changes of majors and things like that,” Kurland said. “All the little surveys that you guys fill out at the end of each quarter,  like ranking the classes and stuff, basically that information does get compiled and people actually do look at it, and people actually take it very, very seriously.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Matthew Santos presented an amendment to add a second policy called “A Bill to Create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students” on to policy one in the A.S. Senate Bill.</p>\n<p>“Policy one would be created as the actual code of conduct with the A.S., all elected officials and the five bullets underneath,” Santos said. “The amendment that I would propose creates policy two under that.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the Code of Conduct had previously been voted on and approved by the Senate, but that the second policy in need of approval included the travel agreement under the five points for elected officials, appointed officials, general members and employees of A.S.</p>\n<p>According to Santos, the agreement would promote “professionalism, civility, respect and courtesy.”</p>\n<p>“We would just call that the A.S. Code of Conduct Travel Agreement… voted upon by the Senate, specific for traveling to events,” Santos said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58703\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58703\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/","id":2885,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2884,2883,2882],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dept. of Theater and Dance Named 2014 50/50 Applause Award Recipient","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Department of Theater and Dance received the 2014 50/50 Applause Award from International Centre for Women Playwrights (ICWP) for having more than 50 percent of its produced plays written by femal...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p></p><div id=\"attachment_58711\" style=\"width: 252px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58711\" data-attachment-id=\"58711\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/icwp-2014-yellow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICWP-2014-yellow.jpg?fit=1171%2C2479&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1171,2479\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"ICWP 2014 yellow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICWP-2014-yellow.jpg?fit=118%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICWP-2014-yellow.jpg?fit=484%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICWP-2014-yellow-483x1024.jpg?resize=242%2C512\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of theaterdance.ucsb.edu\" width=\"242\" height=\"512\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58711\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-58711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of theaterdance.ucsb.edu</em></p></div><br>\nThe Department of Theater and Dance received the 2014 50/50 Applause Award from International Centre for Women Playwrights (ICWP) for having more than 50 percent of its produced plays written by females.\n<p>UCSB is one of 67 recipients in nine countries to have won the Applause Award. Out of the six plays produced at UCSB in the 2013-2014 school year, four of the plays were written by female playwrights.</p>\n<p>Department of Theater and Dance Chair Risa Brainin said she is honored that the university is a recipient of the ICWP award.</p>\n<p>“We are very proud to be part of this international movement to create a gender parity across the world,” Brainin said.</p>\n<p>According to Brainin, the Season Selection Committee is an organization that goes over and chooses plays to be produced at UCSB. In 2014, the Season Selection Committee made a conscious effort to produce plays written by women, Brainin said. </p>\n<p>Third-year theater major Charles Grant said the 50/50 Applause Award is a demonstration of the Theater and Dance’s program to provide a wide array of perspectives, particularly from “the female voice” which, according to Grant, “isn’t often heard.”</p>\n<p>“It is also great that our department decided to choose many productions that were written by females because it gives power and voice to the female perspective,” Grant said. “It also gives the opportunity for females cast in those productions to be able to tell those stories that need to be told.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her involvement with the Department of Theater and Dance, Brainin was also named presidet of the National Theater Conference this year, a national non-profit dedicated to support for and advocacy of American theater. According to Brainin, there is a Women Playwright Initiative within the National Theater Conference, which she hopes will influence the department on campus. </p>\n<p>Kris Bauske, Applause Award co-chair and ICWP board member, said the award marks a progressive change in theater, placing the Theater and Dance program at “the vanguard of social change.”</p>\n<p>“The organizations that received the award step out of that comfort zones and say that they are going to challenge the audience to become in tune with the voices of female playwrights and help them to progress along so that they are as interested in plays written by women as they are written by men,” Bauske said. </p>\n<p>However, Bauske also said there is still room for improvement, even within organizations that have received the award.</p>\n<p>“We are pretty much evenly sliced. We are about 50 percent men and 50 percent women. And yet the majority of plays being produced are written by men,” Bauske said. “That tells us that society is putting a lot more importance on stories about men by men for men, or that women are just not having the opportunity to have their voices heard.”</p>\n<p>According to Bauske, consumers of art should be more cognizant to producing stories that women will be likely to value.</p>\n<p>“Typically, the storytellers that I have heard are women,” Bauske said. “It’s not that women are incapable of creating the same art that men are. It’s just that people need to become more attuned with the stories that women find important.”</p>\n<p>Brainin said the Department of Theater and Dance will continue to progress and to produce plays that are written by a diverse groups of people. </p>\n<p>“This year we focused more on writers of color. We want to have a diversity of voices,” Brainin said. “We are focusing on playwrights from different countries, from different ethnic backgrounds. We are trying to reach out to all kinds of communities.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/","id":2902,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[2901,2900,2899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Mock Trial To Compete in 2014 Yale Invitational","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Mock Trial will fly to New Haven, CT, to compete at the 2014 Yale Invitational, which takes place on Dec. 6 and 7.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p></p><div id=\"attachment_58695\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58695\" data-attachment-id=\"58695\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/m-m-d-bench/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-M-D-bench.jpg?fit=700%2C468&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"700,468\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"M-M-D-bench\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-M-D-bench.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-M-D-bench.jpg?fit=700%2C468&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-M-D-bench.jpg?resize=500%2C334\" alt=\"Member of UCSB Mock Trial at a competition.

Of the 40 teams participating, UCSB will directly compete against four randomly selected teams in two civil trials per day, in which the teams will alternate as plaintiff and defendant. </p>\n<p>According to Mock Trial Vice President and second-year history major Cheryl Wilson, the invitation to Yale is a sign of Mock Trial’s strong reputation as a competitive team.</p>\n<p>“The way that invitationals usually work is that teams from the area are invited. But for the larger tournaments, they try to recruit teams from the larger areas in the U.S., because at nationals, you go against teams from all over the country,” Wilson said. “So if you’re a well known up-and-coming team from another geographic area, you have a much better chance of being invited.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Brett Russell said the tournament will expose UCSB’s team to different competition styles.</p>\n<p>“It’s also a good learning opportunity, because we’ve never seen the styles and the specific attorneys from the East Coast. We definitely could learn a lot from them,” Russell said.  “We see the same teams at every West Coast invitational, and we know almost everyone by name. It becomes kind of a small club.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said the East Coast teams have a large presence in the national competition, which will take place next year.</p>\n<p>“California is a very competitive state for Mock Trial, and we definitely have a pocket of good teams here, but just because there’s so many colleges on the East Coast, a lot of the major teams that win the national competition are from there,” Wilson said. “I would say two or three out of the top 10 teams are usually from California, and the rest are from the East Coast. So for us, it’s an experience to go against upper-level competitors.” </p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy and history double major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Andrew Cavarno said the Yale Invitational is important to the university because it emphasizes the Mock Trial team’s renown national reputation.</p>\n<p>“This is really our first step on the east coast, so how well we do here will definitely influence our national reputation,” Cavarno said.</p>\n<p>According to Cavarno, the six student participants to the Yale invitational have been holding extra practice sessions, but the competition is similar enough to past tournaments in that it will not require a change in the team’s practice style.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been preparing really hard for all of our invitationals, and because they all follow a similar format, we don’t need to prepare specifically for Yale,” Cavarno said, “but I would say that we’ve been preparing a little bit harder.”</p>\n<p>According to Russell, presentation is an important aspect of securing a trial victory.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making an oral argument, like an opening statement, it’s obviously important to have good content,” Russell said, “but what’s often more important is good presentation.”<br>\nWilson said the mock trial team members are confident in their ability to succeed in the competition.</p>\n<p>“We’re going out there to bring the UCSB name out to the East Coast,” Wilson said.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/","id":2955,"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina"},"related":[2954,2953,2952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Protest Mexican Government’s Connection to Missing Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students gathered in the Arbor yesterday to participate in a protest against the government of Mexico for their alleged participation in the kidnapping of 43 Mexican college students, all of whom are ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students gathered in the Arbor yesterday to participate in a protest against the government of Mexico for their alleged participation in the kidnapping of 43 Mexican college students, all of whom are presumed dead.</p>\n<p>In September, 43 students from a school in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, were allegedly taken by police and handed off to members of a criminal group, Guerreros Unidos. Last week, after authorities disclosed the discovery of potential remains, protests sparked across Mexico and many parts of the United States, with students joining in the movement through organized protest in front of a row of 43 photos that represent each of the missing students.</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said the protest consisted of all day activities aimed at engaging and educating students about the incident in Mexico. </p>\n<p>“Today was a collective; we’re standing in solidarity with other UC campuses, and the entire world,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year anthropology major Stephany Rubio, who was one of many organizers of the demonstration, the issue concerning the student deaths has been worsened by the Mexican government’s control of traditional media in the country. </p>\n<p>“In Mexico, the president owns Televisa, which is the main source of getting any news and they’re quieting the situation down as much as they can,” Rubio said. “For us, <em>ya nos cansamos</em> — we’re tired, we want the state to take action.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said social media in Mexico is not regulated and that on the social media site Twitter the tag #YaMeCanse, which is trending worldwide and means, “Enough, I’m tired,” in Spanish, is directed at the Mexican government.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Spanish and sociology double major Jaime Serrano said he felt the need to participate in the protest because he feels there is not enough attention to the issue on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m out here because I think more needed to be done, here especially,” Serrano said. “With such large Spanish-speaking community, I feel more needed to be done about the injustices that are happening in Mexico.”</p>\n<p>According to fifth-year Latin American and Iberian studies and Spanish double major Gabriela Mora, the demonstration was meant to get more students to ask questions, take interest and possibly speak out against injustices in Mexico.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people haven’t even heard about the event,” Mora said. “We had a really good reaction here.

I need to be able to bring to the legislature and to the governor an overwhelming force from students, from UC and CSU unions, and make them realize how angry you are and how you are demanding a specific course of action, which is $100 million a year for the UC and $100 million a year for the CSU.”</p>\n<p>According to Daraka Larimore-Hall, secretary of the California Democratic Party, who has lobbied for years in Sacramento for higher education funding and opposed all UC tuition increases, all members of the UC system must communicate to the Regents that students cannot be treated as “customers.”</p>\n<p>“Now more than ever we have to provide that noise,” Larimore-Hall said. “Students, faculty members, staff, everyone in the University community, has to make their voice loud and clear to Sacramento, that not this time! This time, you don’t get to treat students as customers and cash cows. This time we need to tell the Regents no, absolutely not!”</p>\n<p>According to Robert Samuels, lecturer at UCLA and president of the University Council-American Federation of Teachers, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty in the UC system, tuition could actually increase up to nine percent per year, depending on how much funding the UC system receives from the state.</p>\n<p>“If you actually look at the plan that the office of the president presented, it says that there will be a maximum of 5 percent increases if the state gives 4 percent,” Samuels said. “Well, the governor, in his last budget, it clearly says if UC raises tuition, they lose four percent. So, it is possible that tuition will go up nine percent every year for five years. The plan that was presented is not predictable; it’s not sustainable.”</p>\n<p>However, according to the UC Office of the President, the tuition increase plan actually stipulates a maximum possible increase of five percent annually for five years, depending on the level of state contributions to UC.</p>\n<p>“The new long-term stability plan for tuition and financial aid would guarantee that tuition would not increase by more than 5 percent annually for five years, provided the state maintains its current investment commitment,” the UCOP Long-Term Funding Plan press release states. “The state could also choose to provide additional funds to cover tuition revenue, allowing UC to reduce or lower the tuition and fee increases proposed in this plan.”</p>\n<p>But Samuels said many students are not paying tuition due to Pell Grants, Cal Grants and institutional aid, and thus it is within reason for tuition to be free, as long as the rest of the funding the school receives is used appropriately.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure that the money that comes from the state, and the money that comes from your tuition, actually ends up in the classroom,” Samuels said. “What we’ve seen in the last 10 years is tuition keeps on going up and classes get bigger. There’s fewer graduate student instructors, there’s less personal attention for the students, there’s more multiple choice exams. The quality of education has gone down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58706\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58706\" data-attachment-id=\"58706\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7438/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=1600%2C1017&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1017\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416451771\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7438\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58706\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438-1024x650.jpg?resize=500%2C312\" alt=\"Protesters chant outside of Cheadle Hall after a rally against UC tuition increase that took place Thursday in Storke Plaza.

External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh said students can do more than just rally to protest the tuition increase and that lobbying directly to legislators can be an effective form of action.</p>\n<p>“Student activism not only entails protesting as most people think, but also getting spot at the table with decision-making,” Singh said in an email. “Students need to work together on efforts, like lobbying legislators, because they need to see us people they were elected to serve. This happens with human interaction. Fortunately, Associated Students has a Lobby Corps, and I’m sure with my office collaborating, we will all be busy this year.”</p>\n<p>Singh, who attended the UC Regents meeting on Wednesday, said he learned that working with professors can increase the chances of lowering tuition costs, because students and professors are part of the same system.</p>\n<p>“They too are affected by the quality of their work based on tuition increase and class enrollment,” Singh said in an email. “The human interaction from a professor is lost in a large classroom, and instead it feels more like professor spewing information at us instead of active and engaging learning. And they know this.”</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, a third-year sociology major and rally organizer, said the tuition increases represent a failure of the state to support higher education. Mirza said he blames UC President Janet Napolitano for not exploring options other than raising tuition and said Brown has not prioritized higher education funding.</p>\n<p>“We are tired of public higher education coming at a private price,” Mirza said. “We are here because UC funding is too low a priority. We are not here to play political games of Jan Napolitano and Jerry Brown.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58709\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58709\" data-attachment-id=\"58709\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7475/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=1600%2C950&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,950\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416452272\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7475\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=888%2C527&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58709\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475-1024x608.jpg?resize=500%2C292\" alt=\"Protesters crowd the sixth floor of Cheadle Hall  as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael D.
