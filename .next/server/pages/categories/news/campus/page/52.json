Speaking at the UC Regents meeting, Munger said he envisions the dormitories as “the best undergraduate housing in the world.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“What fascinated me was 28 acres on the ocean, combined with massive stupidity. I like to fix massive stupidity.” — Charles Munger</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Vice-Chairman for Berkshire Hathaway, Munger is currently partner to one of the world’s richest people, Warren Buffet.</p>\n<p>The construction is designed to reduce undergraduate housing costs by as much as 60 percent, and plans for two six-story buildings built on a base of pre-cast concrete. The buildings will have kitchens to reduce meal plan costs, and the top floor of each design will be dedicated to six acres of common room space.</p>\n<p>“Every campus I know of in the world abuses its undergraduates … it finally gets pretty gross,” Munger said, emphasizing the importance of healthy living areas.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69147\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"93804457\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69145\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69147\" data-attachment-id=\"69147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/billionaire-donates-200m-to-fix-gross-dorms/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-3-21-53-pm-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"501,370\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 3.21.53 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=350%2C258\" width=\"350\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?w=501&amp;ssl=1 501w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Munger’s dorms will replace Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicolas Hall.</p></div>\n<p>To accommodate for high student density, Munger plans to replace real windows in several rooms with artificial windows, inspired by artificial portholes on Disney cruise lines which feature “a starfish that comes by and winks at your kid,” said Munger.</p>\n<p>Matilda Mead, third-year psychology major and Residence Hall Association President, said although “overwhelmed by his generosity,” she was disappointed by the conditions of Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“By replacing the those views with his artificial windows, it seems to me as though we would be neglecting our residents from experiencing a large aspect of what they came to UCSB to see: the picturesque scenery,” Mead said. “Besides, I highly doubt any artificial windows would be able to replicate [or] replace our spectacular sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Mead, mental health and academic resources are “severely lacking” on campus, and the best use for Munger’s donation would be to build additional support spaces for students.</p>\n<p>“I just hope he can look at the whole picture and focus on the needs of our residents rather than the aesthetics of our university when determining where his donation will go,” Mead said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T.

If the UC does not continue to support him, Munger will go elsewhere with his plan, but he is enthusiastic about developing at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The UC System has the power of eminent domain,” Munger said. “If it really makes sense to revolutionize housing for the better on one campus, it can be done on other campuses.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article did not include San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms in the list of residences that will be replaced.

id=\"caption-attachment-68960\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em> Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>David Williams arrived on the south lawn of Buchanan Hall Wednesday afternoon to ceremoniously light UCSB’s Eternal Flame — meant to be a symbol of peace between nations — but found the flame could not be lit.</p>\n<p>Williams, the initiator for the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign, said he had asked Chancellor Henry T. Yang several weeks ago if he would fix the flame to remain lit through rain or wind, but arrived to find the flame already burning.</p>\n<p>“We came a little disappointed that we didn’t get to do the ceremony as we’d asked, but we were happy that it was lit,” Williams said. “I was confident it would stay lit.”</p>\n<p>However, as Williams honored the memorial on Wednesday, the flame continued to go out.</p>\n<p>Williams hopes students encourage the university to make “a mental shift” to prioritize the Eternal Flame.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the University of California, whose scientists have made all our nuclear weapons, and now the chancellor is even an electrical engineer, and I’m sure they can figure out how to keep a flame burning without the wind or the rain blowing it out,” Williams said. “But it’s just not important enough, and it won’t be important enough, I believe, until the students make it important enough.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Estrada, a spokesperson for UCSB, explained that in order for the flame to burn regularly, a new underground gas line and starter would need to be installed.</p>\n<p>“A number of fixes have been attempted in the past, but they haven’t addressed the main problems,” Estrada said, adding that it was important that the university find a “more permanent fix” before taking additional action.</p>\n<p>“It is being discussed and certainly we don’t want to have an eternal flame that’s not functioning,” Estrada said.</p>\n<p>Williams said although fixing the flame may be expensive, it is significant to community members and leaders who have worked to preserve the historic flame.</p>\n<p>If the flame is not fixed, “it’s going to be disappointing for a lot of people,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>If the flame is eventually lit, it will be carried in the Annual Global Peace Walk from Taos, N.M. to Santa Fe. It will then be carried in the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Peace March in summer where it will travel from New York City to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to The White House.</p>\n<p>Williams, who called himself a “peace movement activist and a spiritual practitioner” began the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign in 1990 and has been passionate about keeping the Eternal Flame lit since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The Eternal Flame monument was given as a gift to the university from the UCSB class of 1968.</p>\n<p>Williams stressed the importance of UCSB’s Eternal Flame and its extensive history, including its being lit in 1990 with the Hiroshima Peace Flame, a peace symbol after the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>“[That flame] was lit in the [1990s] as a prayer for peace that Hiroshima should never happen again anywhere in the world,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“And then, they’ve kept that burning as an eternal flame ever since in Hiroshima,” he continued. “As far as I know, [UCSB] is the only place in the United States where a Hiroshima peace flame was installed on an outdoor public monument. That’s why it’s so important: it’s a symbol.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Photojournalist and author Steve Winter presented <em>On the Trail of Big Cats: Tigers, Cougars, and Snow Leopards,</em> a chronicle of his work photographing wildlife throughout the world, during a lecture Sunday at UCSB’s Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>During his lecture, Winter presented videos and audio recordings varying from jungles and mountains in Asia to mountain lions living in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“I did not choose big cats, big cats chose me,” Winter said, adding that he tries to tell the animals’ stories through his photographs.</p>\n<p>“If we save big cats, we can help save ourselves,” Winter said. “By saving the large plots of land that wide-ranging predators need to survive, we give them a home, a place to hunt, to mate and a place for the young to disperse. Conservation on such a grand scale radiates outward with global implications.”</p>\n<p>James Livingston, second-year communication major at Santa Barbara Community College, said Winter’s lecture taught him about the dangers of human involvement in natural environments, such as poachers.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know the effect that poachers really had on the environment and how they are tearing everything apart,” Livingston said. “I’m going to do more research on the places that Winter talked about because I’m interested in looking at these foreign places that don’t get much coverage.”</p>\n<p>Winter’s expedition into the wild world of cats highlighted his message that there is a global responsibility to conserve wildlife.</p>\n<p>“The forests are the lungs of the world,” Winter said. “These are the homes of the big cats, providing the air we breathe, pulling carbon from the atmosphere and slowing climate change.”</p>\n<p>“Forests protect the towns and cities around them from flooding, prevent erosion … and provide drinking water for billions of people because forests and grasslands act like sponges,” he continued. “Seventy-five percent of all water in the world comes from forests; 50 percent of the oxygen comes from forests.”</p>\n<p>First-year music and biology double major Maya Gorgas applauded Winter for linking humans and animals.</p>\n<p>“I loved Winter’s spiel on connecting animals and nature with humans and how we are both part of this network where we can both help each other,” Gorgas said.</p>\n<p>Chelsea Brandwein, third-year communication major, said Winter’s presentation of a mountain lion in front of the Hollywood sign projected an interesting contrast between urban and natural environments.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part of the lecture was when Winter presented the picture of the mountain lion with the Hollywood sign in the background because it was an incredibly moving picture that showed the juxtaposition of wildlife and the city,” Brandwein said. “It showed how close we live to wild animals and don’t realize it.”</p>\n<p>Winter urged attendees to understand the ways in which their environment is connected to those of the big cats.</p>\n<p>“I hope these stories and images help to inspire you because where there’s life, there’s hope that the time to act is now,” Winter said.</p><div

Awards Dinner on Wednesday in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>UCSB First was able to award grants to seven more campus organizations than last year. The five winners of $250 grants were Kappa Kappa Gamma, Greeks 4 Kids, Gamma Zeta Alpha, Dance Marathon and Swipe Out Hunger. The six winners of $500 grants were Queer Art Collective, Global Medical Brigades, Zeta Beta Tau, Street Health Outreach, Phi Delta Epsilon and Love Your Melon.</p>\n<p>Chris Pizzinat, deputy director of UCSB’s Office of Development, said those who participate in charity work should be honored for the example they set.</p>\n<p>“Philanthropy is not inherently ingrained in everyone, giving back is a largely learned value,” Pizzinat said. “It is emulated by those who feel an ownership of either an organization, a community or a cause. [These groups] are ones who teach these concepts to others through example. We are proud of what they are accomplishing and the impact of their work and we wish them much success.”</p>\n<p>According to Madison Frame, UCSB First co-chair and third-year psychology major, the campus organizations turned in applications describing their philanthropic work to be considered for the grant. Frame said UCSB First closely scrutinized applicant groups.</p>\n<p>“We chose the winners with the help of our committee, looking through all the applications and had a sort of rubric to help guide the committee members in evaluating how worthy the applicants were of receiving a grant,” Frame said. “The applications go through several checks with our advisors, with the committee and we even involved the Office of Student Life to ensure every component is accounted for.”</p>\n<p>Megan Jones, UCSB First co-chair and third-year communication and global studies double major, said UCSB First chose grant winners in part based on how they have expressed gratitude to donors in the past.</p>\n<p>“An interesting part of our rubric is based on the involvement the organization will have with the donors who gave these grants and are sponsoring in honor of their work,” Jones said. “It was something we really took into consideration because philanthropy gratitude is something we really emphasize.”</p>\n<p>Kelli Kaesberg, philanthropy chairperson of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said the sorority will most likely use the grant to plan a springtime philanthropy event for a charity that provides books for children in need.</p>\n<p>“We just had our fall and winter philanthropy events and since they were so successful, I think we’d be able to pull off a springtime philanthropy event where most of the proceeds would go to Reading is Fundamental,” Kaesberg said.</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, executive director of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biology major, said the grant will go toward next year’s Dance Marathon event.</p>\n<p>“The money we were given tonight will go to helping us start the planning for next year’s Dance Marathon event, where it will be bigger and better than this year’s,” Padlipsky said. “And all the money we raise then will go to Cottage Children’s Hospital.”</p>\n<p>Aimee Michelle, co-chair of Queer Art Collective and third-year CCS art and sociology double major, said she believes the organization was chosen for the grant due to its quickly growing presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think they chose us because we just started this organization this year,” Michelle said. “We already put on a $19,000 event and we’re already working with a lot of other groups even if we just started.”</p>\n<p>According to Xara Lopez, co-chair of Queer Art Collective, the money will be used to support queer students’ artistic expressions.</p>\n<p>“The money is going to go to supporting a lot of our new ventures,” Lopez said. “We specifically want to have spaces for queer students who express themselves artistically, so one of the main blocks we had was art supplies and those things cost a lot of money.”</p>\n<p>Caitie Mathias, president of Global Medical Brigades, said the organization will use its grant for medicine needed for its summer trip to Honduras.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this money to pay for medications to go to Honduras in the summer,” Mathias said.  “Medications cost a lot of money and we see about 1,200 patients while we’re there and it’s kind of scary when we’re close to running out of medications, so every bit counts.”</p>\n<p>Mathias said her organization “promotes self-sustainability” in the communities in which it works, which she believes is why it was chosen for a grant.</p>\n<p>“At the end of our clinic we have a public health lesson for all the people in the community,” Mathias said. “Adults have their own public lesson about nutrition, family-planning, STDs and then we have a health lesson for the children and we teach them about brushing their teeth and other health things. We’re there to make lasting changes.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Linares, public relations manager for Love Your Melon, said the organization was surprised to receive a grant, being such a young organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re just starting off on campus and not a lot of people know about us,” Linares said. “We just started here in November but we’re not an official organization on campus until Spring Quarter, so getting the award feels really great that they acknowledged out work.”</p>\n<p>According to Fanzana Chapman, secretary for Love Your Melon, she believes the organization was selected because of the unique nature of its work providing hats for children with cancer.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the reasons why is we don’t hear very often [of] clubs that are supporting child cancer awareness,” Chapman said. “We do hear things like breast cancer or cancer awareness but for Love Your Melon, this will be the first club establishment here at UCSB. I think it’s something where you hear it’s unique and something that is here for the first time.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/","id":2518,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2517,2516,2515],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A Room of the UCen to discuss resolutions supporting free speech, divestment from Turkey, honoraria reform and implementation of the Single Transferable Vote (STV).</p>\n<p>During public forum, fourth-year political science major Brandon Morse presented “A Resolution in Support of Free Speech.” Morse showed the senate a seven-foot “free speech ball” covered in students’ ideas written in black marker.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of people, we had several hundred people, sign this ball,” Morse said. “There’s some really offensive things that are written on here.”</p>\n<p>Morse said students have the right to express themselves in any area on campus, not only in ‘free speech zones.’</p>\n<p>“We have ‘Fuck Trump’ written on here about nine times, because people just really don’t like Trump. We have people that say ‘Fuck Bernie,’ we have people that drew a picture of Mohammed on here,” Morse said. “I mean there’s a lot of really offensive things that are on this ball right now, but it is right of the students to make all of these statements and all of these drawings on this ball, not only in the free speech zones, but anywhere here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Senate also passed “A Resolution in Support of Free Speech” unanimously.</p>\n<p>Sose Abraamyan, vice president of the Armenian Student Association, presented “Resolution To Divest from the Republic of Turkey.” Abraamyan said the resolution aims to hold the UC Board of Regents responsible for investing in country that perpetuates the denial of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“Along with continued violations of human rights to this day…we want to hold UCSB and the UC Regents accountable for ethical investments of student tuition,” Abraamyan said.</p>\n<p>Abraamyan said the resolution is not a “smear campaign” against Turkey.</p>\n<p>“What we don’t want to do is target any specific groups of people, culture, religion, language or any student group on campus,” Abraamyan said.</p>\n<p>Senate passed the resolution in a ‘roll call’ 21-0-1 vote.</p>\n<p>After Public Forum, Senators passed honoraria for the Winter Quarter, which is similar to the system of wage stipends. All senators requested full honoraria of $430, but half did not receive the full amount. Senators may be denied full honoraria due to an absence, speaking out of order or missing Senate retreat.</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed “A Bill To Reform Honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Louis Mariano, off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said Senate should not support capping honoraria for the specialized side-committees of A.S, which are called Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs). Mariano argued that certain BCUs currently have the budget for full honoraria and should not be unfairly restricted.</p>\n<p>However, Sara Maroofi, engineering collegiate senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said the bill would not go in effect until the next school year, giving BCUs time to adjust their budget.</p>\n<p>“This bill doesn’t get put into place until next school year so it doesn’t affect the budget that current BCUs have for honoraria this year,” Maroofi said.</p>\n<p>The bill was passed by senate in a 16-3-2 hand vote.</p>\n<p>Mathew Burciaga, executive managing editor of <em>The Bottom Line </em>and fourth-year history major, said he was upset by the passing of the honoraria cap.</p>\n<p>“I’m disappointed in you as an organization. In my own opinion, you have created an atmosphere of toxicity, pettiness and hyper-partisanship,” Burciaga said. “The fact that none of you have done more than bat an eye at the fact that five of your colleagues are no longer on the table is astonishing.”</p>\n<p>Burciaga said Senate did not represent his interests as a student.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to remind you of your duties — you are here neither to quarrel among yourselves nor engage in politicking; you are here to represent the interests of the student body and the greater UCSB community,” Burciaga said. “As a student, I cannot say you represent my interests. As a student, I’m saddened to say I’ve lost faith in you as an entity.”</p>\n<p>Senate then began a discussion of STV, a ranked voting system aimed at creating more proportional representation. When casting a vote as an STV, the vote transfers candidates as the options are narrowed down. Each voter selects their preferences and the vote abides by these choices as candidates are narrowed down. A.S. will use STV for senate elections starting in spring 2016.</p>\n<p>According to Stevan Abdalmalik, third-year political science major, STV has increased voter turnout in places where it has been implemented.</p>\n<p>“Every other instance where STV has gone up as the election system, voter turnout has increased,” Abdamalik said. “Voter turnout increases with Single Transferable Vote.

Senate met Wednesday to discuss the new Single Transferable Vote (STV) system that will be used in this spring’s senate elections in an effort to create more proportionate representation of the student body.</p>\n<p>In the STV system, students will vote for their on or off-campus and collegiate senate representatives through a ranking system designed to better reflect the desires of each constituency.  A YouTube video used to explain Single Transferable Voting to the Senators in the first quarter can be found <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman spoke of the benefits of switching to the STV system.</p>\n<p>“In previous elections, it was possible that 60 percent of the vote goes to one party, 40 percent goes to the other when there are two major parties,” Lieberman said. “The issue with that is that the 60 percent would get 95 percent of the seats. In STV, in theory, it’s a more proportional representation at the same time, without having the minority 40 percent become the supermajority.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question about how the vote will be distributed, Lieberman said, “If you vote for someone and they get cut, and your second choice gets cut as well, then it [the vote] goes to your third choice, and so on.”</p>\n<p>“Once you get to the point where there are no ‘nexts’ available, then they’re gone,” Lieberman said, explaining that people who vote for candidates that are no longer eligible will not be counted.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum, proxy for off-campus senator Natalie Jordan, asked what would happen if a candidate was many voters’ second choice.</p>\n<p>“When we move up the list, should I not get all the votes that put me as their second?” Tannenbaum asked.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nemeh, second-year economics and political science double major, said a candidate who garnered many second-place votes “would get eliminated immediately.”</p>\n<p>“The only reason behind that would be that first choice votes are the most valuable,” Nemeh said. “When we’re looking at first choice votes, we’re looking at the most accurate representation of what students want to see on campus. That is a decision that we [Elections Committee] did not make and left for you to decide.”</p>\n<p>“A Resolution in Support of the Implementation of a Good Samaritan Policy within the Campus Regulations,” “A Bill to Reform Honoraria,” “A Bill to Add a Mental Health Coordinator in COSWB’s Legal Code” and “A Resolution to Create a Group Project to Establish a Political Economy Major at UCSB” were all sent to Campus Affairs.</p>\n<p>“A Resolution to Divest from the Republic of Turkey to End the Perpetuation of the Armenian Genocide” was sent to External Affairs.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated incorrectly that Nawar Nemeh is an on-campus senator.

Womyn’s Commission</p></div>\n<p>According to the conference mission statement, the event recognizes that womxn of color are members of marginalized communities whose shared experiences come to shape their identity in society. The purpose of the conference, then, is to create a means of supporting ethnic minority womxn — to “exist unapologetically.”</p>\n<p>“We work towards empowerment for ourselves in a world that tries to shame or erase our existence,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Organizers have laid out several questions they hope to discuss throughout the weekend, such as “How do we navigate and come to comprehend our trauma in relation to our very existence?” and “Why is it important to center our movements on love and re-incorporate joy into every aspect of our lives in order to counteract this dominant narrative of struggle?”</p>\n<p>“We hope to generate answers to these questions through a combination of individual reflection and the sharing of collective knowledge,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Karen Hanna, graduate student in feminist studies and event volunteer, said she and Lola Mondragon, graduate student in Chican@ studies, will be hosting a workshop titled “Sacred Bodies, Safe Spaces: Healing in Community Through Drumming, Meditation, and Coloring.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a place that we can build and say it’s for us, and we don’t have to feel guilty about that,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>As an Asian American womxn, Hanna said she often feels devalued by stereotypes that define Asian womxn as quiet and submissive. Hanna said the conference offers a place of healing for womxn of color who are often subject to stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Michaela Austin, first-year environmental studies major and feminist studies minor, said WOCC acts as an opportunity for ethnic minority womxn to discuss issues that society does not otherwise address.</p>\n<p>“Living in a racialized patriarchal society, womxn, and especially womxn of color — our needs aren’t met. We’re not talked about in issues,” Austin said. “Having a space where we can talk will build solidarity and space.”</p>\n<p>According to Mondragon, the conference is a “sacred” space for womxn of color to support one another.</p>\n<p>“It’s not only sacred but it’s a safe space where we have a shared experience in multiple ways as we can come together to help lift each other up, lean on each other and see each other,” Mondragon said. “We aren’t usually seen by others in a world where we’re often invisible.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>*<em>This article has been updated from its original form to reflect an omitted quote that was not necessary to the story.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/","id":2624,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2623,2622,2621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Peace Corps Rank Rises","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara’s rank among universities producing Peace Corps Volunteers rose from 18th to eighth place in 2015.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>In 2015, UCSB had the eighth highest number of Peace Corps volunteers among universities, increasing from a ranking of 18th in the previous year</h3>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s rank among universities producing Peace Corps Volunteers rose from 18th to eighth place in 2015.</p>\n<p>Since U.S. President John F.

Corps representative come and talk to us about Peace Corps, what it is and how you apply,” Flint said. “That kept my interest [in Peace Corps] going.”<br>\nFlint said she believes joining the Peace Corps is a valuable experience, and she encourages UCSB students to volunteer with the organization.</p>\n<p>“I encourage any and all UCSB students to look into the Peace Corps and see what it is,” Flint said. “I think it is extremely rewarding; you just have to make sure that it is the right thing for you to do at that point in your life.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of UCSB Career Services Emily White said Peace Corps is establishing relationships with many different departments and has presence at career fairs, application workshops and career panels.</p>\n<p>“Over the last two years, Career Services has been working with Ty Manning … who really understands UCSB and has been able to increase the numbers in Peace Corps volunteers,” White said. “He is promoting the Peace Corps in all different types of places, all throughout campus and its different communities.”</p>\n<p>This year, the Peace Corps will be “heavily involved” in UCSB’s LGBTQ events, according to White.</p>\n<p>“You can really see the success in building those relationships and getting the word and opportunities of the Peace Corps out there,” White said.</p>\n<p>Darlene Moreno, UCSB alumna and current Peace Corps volunteer in Armenia, said she attended Peace Corps information sessions at UCSB to learn more about the organization and even kept in touch with UCSB’s Peace Corps recruiters up until leaving for her service.</p>\n<p>“Through these sessions, I learned more about the application process and what the Peace Corps was looking for in a volunteer,” Moreno said in an email. “Because of the suggestions I received during these sessions, I became a volunteer at my old high school and at a local library near my home in Los Angeles in order to gain more experience with students before applying to the Peace Corps.”</p>\n<p>Carl Haislett, UCSB alumnus and current Peace Corps volunteer in Lesotho, said Peace Corps’s campus recruitment events taught him about the organization.</p>\n<p>“I contacted our school’s recruiter, Tyman, and met with him a few times to discuss the application process,” Haislett said in an email. “I also attended an event put on by the Santa Barbara Peace Corps Association which was a great way to meet returned volunteers and pick their brains.”</p>\n<p>Haislett said UCSB’s recent ranking does not come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>“I’m super proud,” Haislett said in an email.

focused on the speakers’ ideas for a movement from a two-state solution to a focus on smaller-scale initiatives for peace. The discussion centered on the notion that for the two countries to reach a definite resolution, they must first create trustworthy relations through the reconciliation and realistic negotiations.</p>\n<p>Makovsky is an adjunct professor at John Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He is the co-author of Myths, Illusions, and Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East and frequently contributes to the New York Times, the Jerusalem Post and Foreign Policy. Makovsky served as a Senior Advisor to U.S Secretary of State John Kerry during the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations of 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari formerly served as the executive director at the American Task Force on Palestine. Al-Omari has worked extensively within the Palestinian Authority, with roles including director of the International Relations Department in the Office of the Palestinian President and advisor to former Palestine Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. He also played a key role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process as an advisor to the Palestinian negotiation team throughout 1991-2001. He participated in negotiations leading to the Camp David Accords and the Taba Summit.</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, both countries must wholeheartedly try to negotiate toward peace.</p>\n<p>“[An] all or nothing approach tends to be nothing,” Makovsky said.<br>\nMakovsky said current leaders are facing challenges as they try to work with a generation that “wasn’t even born when the handshake happened,” referring to the Camp David Accords.</p>\n<p>“Objectively difficult leaders that are risk averse are left with the toughest work ahead,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68606\" style=\"width: 786px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68606\" data-attachment-id=\"68606\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/international-experts-join-to-discuss-palestine/paradigm2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=2285%2C3015&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2285,3015\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"paradigm2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68606\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2-776x1024.jpg?resize=776%2C1024\" alt=\"Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus\" width=\"776\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1 189w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=768%2C1013&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Makovsky said a critical part of the issue is the lack of compromise.<br>\n“Instead of sharing opinions, they reflect them,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said in order to believe progress is possible, Palestinians must see progress in their daily lives.</p>\n<p>“From a security point of view, Israel can take more measures in the West Bank that will give the Palestinians breathing room,” al-Omari said.</p>\n<p>He also said he believes a “rehabilitation of the P.A. [Palestinian Authority]” would support a new paradigm that shifts toward progress.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said he hopes it is possible to shift away from the current five negotiation points of water, settlement, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and security because he believes the “five for five” deal is too absolute.</p>\n<p>“I think what you would do is — this new paradigm, when you want to flesh it out — is to say ‘okay, we’re not going to do the five for five. We’re not going to get the grand deal on all five issues,’” Makovsky said. “‘But we’re going to single a direction towards the two states, maintain a viability.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, Israelis need to see less of a military presence in order to feel safe.</p>\n<p>“The army would stay exactly where they are. Of course they’d have less of a footprint because they’d have to protect less people, but I think for the Israelis living in Jaffa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities — all they want is to be safe,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said Israeli citizens want their government to be honest in explaining the country’s situation.</p>\n<p>“All they want is their leaders to tell them, ‘If I make gestures to the Palestinians, am I more secure or am I more vulnerable?’ That’s all they care about,” Makovsky said. “I think they’d care less if some small settlements outside of Nablus stay exactly where they are.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, there needs to be a distinction between ideology of safety and individual safety.</p>\n<p>“So, what you’d be doing is decoupling these two issues and signal a new direction — tell the Palestinians you want them to have their own space, but because the region is a meltdown, you’re not going to pull the army out,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Julie Alexander, fourth-year psychology major who attended the talk, said she heard about the event through Facebook and was interested to hear from individuals who have played key roles in international policy.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time, all we get is media coverage,” Alexander said. “To hear the reasons why from a source closer to the issue is a really special opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Kimberly Ruiz, fourth-year global studies major, said she believes discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict from a new perspective could lead to a solution.</p>\n<p>“The discussion has the possibility to bring out new ideas,” Ruiz said. “Shifting the way a problem is approached can make some change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily

appropriation in today’s society. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center hosted a faculty-led panel discussion Tuesday evening to discuss cultural appropriation in today’s society.</p>\n<p>The panelists addressed critical issues and nuances between cultural appropriation, appreciation and assimilation. The event was followed by a fashion show highlighting culturally honored representations of self.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor and panel moderator Kum-Kum Bhavnani said culture does not reside within a person or group, but is defined by relationships.</p>\n<p>“The culture is created through our relationships with people … it isn’t a commodity that sits inside of us,” Bhavnani said. “Once you accept that, then you have to say, ‘Well what do we do about culture?’”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies professor Micaela Diaz-Sanchez said intersectionality should propel this conversation.</p>\n<p>“When we are talking about the appropriation of race with regard to fashion, we should also always be thinking about gender and sexuality and class,” Diaz-Sanchez said. “Who is wearing what, in what context, and by whom is what we are wearing made?”</p>\n<p>English professor Felice Blake said Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a colorblind world where people could exist in harmony and their “racial differences, appearances, etc. would not be a basis for discrimination.”</p>\n<p>According to Blake, Martin Luther King Jr.’s idea of colorblindness differs from the modern versions widely adopted today.</p>\n<p>“So more often than not, the argument for color blindness usually used to say, ‘Things are fair, everyone take the test and the scores will tell us who is the smart ones, who is deserving, who is worthy — and forget about the past,’” Blake said. “‘It is the people who keep bringing up race that causes the race problem. Aren’t we all supposed to be color blind?’”</p>\n<p>Blake said an important aspect of privilege is ensuring that someone does not feel they have encouraged a system of dominance.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to keep in mind the ways that someone can have privilege without feeling as if they have taken personally a part in producing a system of dominance,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>According to Blake, people oftentimes associate privilege with unearned advantage.</p>\n<p>“Advantages that one has, unearned, simply by virtue of the fact of how one was born — but those advantages come because someone else is receiving some unearned disadvantages at the same time,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said the reality of inequality is that one does not have to commit a heinous brutality against someone of color to participate in a system that is racist.</p>\n<p>“If you didn’t know before you got here: Sorry, the United States is a racist country,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said while not every use of appropriation is a violent and cruel practice, one must be open to see when cultural appropriation can be offensive.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t to say that every single instance is an appropriation and is menacing and is a racist practice,” Blake said. “When is it a question of borrowing and exchange, and when is it a question of theft?”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, the fashion show began, featuring outfits from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Columbia, Palestine, Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam and Kazakhstan.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68552\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68552\" data-attachment-id=\"68552\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/faculty-panel-discusses-cultural-appropriation/cultural-appropriation-panel-_by-effie-sklavenitis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cultural Appropriation Panel _by Effie Sklavenitis-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68552\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68552\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said she was grateful individuals could use this event to showcase their individual cultures and heritage.</p>\n<p>“We are so grateful for our incredible models … who are representing their own cultures, heritages, ethnicities and identities,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Amanda Becerra and participant in the fashion show said she was proud of her Columbian culture but finds it hard to find other students at UCSB who share the same culture.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with Columbian culture.

UCSB Girl Up, an organization that aims to provide a better future and more opportunities for women and girls worldwide, will accept donations during the event going towards aiding girls in Malawi, Liberia, Guatemala, Ethiopia and India.</p>\n<p>Effie Sklavenitis, third-year global studies major and External Vice President of Girl Up UCSB, said the event is an opportunity to support women’s education.</p>\n<p>“Girl Up is shedding light on the need to support girls’ education and inform others about the challenges girls still face today, not only abroad, but in our own country as well,” Sklavenitis said.</p>\n<p>According to Sklavenitis, Girl Up donations go to disadvantaged young girls in other countries who experience inequality and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“According to the Girl Up website, the second most common cause of death for girls between the ages of 15 to 19 is complications from pregnancy and childbirth,” Sklavenitis said. “50 percent of all sexual assaults worldwide are against girls 15 or younger, and one in seven girls in developing countries is married before the age of 15.”</p>\n<p>Emily Farrell, third-year anthropology major and Social Media Chair for Girl Up UCSB, said the organization raised money to provide bikes for girls in Malawi two years ago.</p>\n<p>“In a month they had raised more than $100,000 to provide bikes, bike parts and maintenance training to 550 adolescent girls,” Farrell said.</p>\n<p>Farrell said the organization is hopeful there will be a good turnout for the screening.</p>\n<p>“Two weeks ago, we hosted a screening of ‘Girl Rising,’ which had a good turnout, but we expect ‘He Named Me Malala’ to be even bigger and better,” Farrell said. “People love Malala and this film is a fantastic documentary, an inspiring account of what she has achieved so far at only 18 years old.”</p>\n<p>Diana Torres Luevanos, fourth-year biological anthropology and history of art and architecture double major and President of UCSB Girl Up, said all girls should have the same rights to education.</p>\n<p>“We are being helped to get an education,” Luevanos said. “Why should girls in developing countries not have the same rights? Why are their dreams worth less than ours?”</p>\n<p>Torres Luevanos said the screening is a great opportunity for the students to understand how fortunate they are to be able to contribute to the advancement of young women and girls who don’t enjoy the same privileges.</p>\n<p>“By showing this movie, we want to show that just as Malala is getting her education, every girl, no matter where they are, they deserve the same rights as we do, they deserve their dreams to be supported and those dreams can be chased with a pen, paper and a school,” Luevanos said.</p>\n<p>Shreya Shailendra, third-year psychology major and Outreach Chair of Girl Up UCSB, said it is “every human being’s right” to receive an education.</p>\n<p>“Hence, it is important to recognize the people who, like Malala Yousafzai, fight for these girls’ rights despite having terrifying amounts of opposition,” Shailendra said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-68541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Gauchos United for Israel and Santa Barbara Hillel hosted an open discussion with Israeli soldiers on Tuesday as part of a nationwide tour put on by the organization StandWithUs.</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldiers Tour program enables reserve duty Israeli college students to share their experiences as ordinary Israeli citizens, their views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and their personal stories to reveal the individuals behind the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The tour has travelled throughout the U.S., visiting colleges, high schools, synagogues and churches.</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, third-year film and media studies and sociology double major, said the discussion provided a first person account of the experiences of the Israeli soldiers.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to get first hand experience from the Israeli soldiers’ perspective, especially because we spend so much time learning about Israeli policies in conflict. It’s really insightful to hear from them,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Eidan Shalom said he was interested to hear from IDF soldiers firsthand about their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a cool opportunity to speak to the people that are actually there. Primary sources, rather than what we hear on the media,” Shalom said. “Hear from the people that see it — that live it.”</p>\n<p>Both guest speakers chose to share only their first names with the audience, as there had been angry comments posted on social media concerning members of IDF coming to speak.</p>\n<p>Gilad, 27, spent six years in the IDF as a paratrooper and later as part of the Intelligence Corps. He said the media does not effectively portray the experiences of soldiers in Israel.</p>\n<p>“We say in Israel we don’t always have a choice on if we want to fight or not, but we do have a choice on how we fight,” Gilad said. “This is one of those things you won’t hear about in the news because you really don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Edan, 28, was with the ground combat division. He is pursuing a PhD in a program involved in researching heart regeneration to help fight against heart attacks. According to Edan, the purpose of the tour is to inform the public about the plights of Israeli soldiers in order to counter media sources that misrepresent them.</p>\n<p>“[I] could go on and on about my research, but that’s not why I’m here. My heart, and Gilad’s as well, is under a different kind of attack. In saying that I mean we hear and we follow what goes on around the world,” Edan said. “Sources change all kind of acts and makes all of these accusations about us towards Palestinians. And this is very tough for us and very frustrating. And that’s why we’re here, going around and sharing our personal stories and giving people the opportunity to listen to real stories without anyone changing it in the process.”</p>\n<p>Gilad said he became involved in the Israeli army because he felt it was the best thing he could do for himself.</p>\n<p>“I know we come and we talk and parts of the army might sound cool. But it sucks. But you really do it because you understand that this is the most important thing you could be doing with yourself right now and it is for me,” Gilad said. “And you ask what you get from the army? And for me, it’s a sense of proportion.”</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldier tour is in its first session, traveling around the Southern United States. A second tour will begin in mid-April touring the Northern states.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/israeli-soldiers-share-experiences-during-open-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/israeli-soldiers-share-experiences-during-open-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/israeli-soldiers-share-experiences-during-open-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/israeli-soldiers-share-experiences-during-open-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/israeli-soldiers-share-experiences-during-open-discussion/","id":2623,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[2622,2621,2620],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
