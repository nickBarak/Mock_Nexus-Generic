Lee, a second-year political science major, was detained in connection with a theft that occurred on April 19 at Santa Catalina residence hall and faces charges of felony burglary, unauthorized altering of computer data system, receiving stolen property and grand theft.</p>\n<p>The decision to plea not guilty was largely a strategic measure, Lee said.</p>\n<p>“It was recommended by my attorney,” Lee said. “It was basically to postpone the preliminary hearing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, Lee said he will continue to serve as a student body representative — starting at today’s 5 p.m. A.S. Legislative Council meeting.</p>\n<p>“I will be performing my job for the rest of this quarter,” Lee said. “For this year at least, I will continue to represent the students as best as possible.”</p>\n<p>According to Lee, there is no connection between his elected office and the criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a personal matter,” Lee said. “I believe there’s a boundary between this and my Legislative Council position.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, Legislative council members must “remember that they are elected to the ASUCSB Legislative Council for the sole purpose of serving students and  shall  during  Legislative  Council  meetings,  show  the  highest  degree  of respect, regard and decency to their fellow students.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, who oversees A.S. Legislative Council, said the allegations will not affect Lee’s position in the association for the time being.</p>\n<p>“At this point, he’s still innocent until he’s convicted of any crime,” Elwood said. “In all likelihood, I won’t personally take any action.”</p>\n<p>Elwood, a fourth-year political science major, said Lee’s situation does not reflect upon the integrity of the council as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Based on what I’ve heard — which is just speculation — it sounds like he’s one guy who made a mistake,” Elwood said. “As far as my memory proves, the council hasn’t had any legal problems this year.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37728\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/accused-member-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37728\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/accused-member-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/accused-member-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/accused-member-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/accused-member-office/","id":3133,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3132,3131,3130],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Voice Concerns at A.S.

A.S. hopes the meeting encouraged communication between the students and A.S. </p></div>Associated Students held a transitional forum yesterday in the MultiCultural Center to encourage student feedback about the association’s plans for the upcoming year.\n<p>A panel of both incoming and outgoing executive officers led a roundtable discussion among roughly 50 student participants on issues such as the student government’s spending priorities and ongoing projects. The forum aimed to promote transparency within A.S. through an open discussion of topics ranging from increased recycling efforts to student involvement in budgetary issues.</p>\n<p>A.S. President-elect Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major, said the event sought to promote better communication among the association’s various entities and with the student body.</p>\n<p>“A.S. should work on how they can work together,” Weber said. “The forum was a place to listen and talk about what the priorities for next year should be.”</p>\n<p>The forum also served as a medium for students to discuss solutions to next year’s significantly impacted budget. According to current Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, a fourth-year political science major, the association will receive the same amount of funding for 2011-12 as they did for this Spring Quarter alone.</p>\n<p>“We have this mind of expansion but really we’re shrinking,” Elwood said. “We need to change our focus of where we spend our money.”</p>\n<p>Elwood said next year’s executives will need to concentrate on refocusing the management of student fees.</p>\n<p>“A.S. can still grow; we just have to change our mindset,” Elwood said. “Food and T-shirts at every meeting is a luxury. We can do more, but in different ways.”</p>\n<p>Current A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, a fourth-year sociology and global studies major, said student leaders are responsible for incorporating students’ interests into the association’s goals.</p>\n<p>“As elected officials, it is their job to help the grassroots movements,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Associated Students needs to be associated to the students. If not, then you’re irrelevant.”</p>\n<p>Persian Student Group Co-President Armand Armin, a second-year economics and global studies major, said next year’s officials should develop focused outreach efforts to reach the greater campus community.</p>\n<p>“There are different communities of students that are working really hard on all the issues A.S. is working on,” Armin said. “I think A.S. is ignoring these grassroots movements. You have to look at communities that are actually doing work. It’s not just the students, it’s the families — families that have been here for decades and are being ignored by students.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee, a second-year political science major, said it is vital to provide information about student governmental matters to students who are living off campus.</p>\n<p>“We need to put A.S. in new students’ heads, but we also want to get the off-campus population involved as well,” Lee said. “We should also think about transferring the good momentum that was built this year to next year.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/","id":3140,"author":{"id":213,"name":"Daniela Montes"},"related":[3139,3138,3137],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Office of the President, is intended to inform students about the expected campus-level consequences of California Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed $500 million cut to the UC. A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, Presidential Leadership Fellow Hadar Dor and Commissioner for Budget Resources Armando Guerrero will serve as the event’s coordinators.</p>\n<p>Monge-Rodriguez said the forum aims to clear up confusion about the University’s finances and allow opportunities for student participation.</p>\n<p>“Many students see and feel the effects of budget cuts but often don’t understand the source of these cuts or who the key decision-makers are in administering them,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Beyond providing information, we hope to create a space for dialogue where students have the opportunity to counsel UCSB administrators on how to make budgetary decisions in a way that is sensitive to our wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>Campus administrators and faculty members including Executive Vice Chancellor Gene Lucas, Assistant Chancellor Todd Lee, Dean of Undergraduate Education Mary Nisbet and economics professor Henning Bohn will also be present.</p>\n<p>According to Guerrero, the forum will facilitate discussion between campus decision-makers and the student body.</p>\n<p>“A goal that we have is to make the administrators more accessible to the students,” Guerrero said. “We want to try to get the information that circulates among administrators to students.”</p>\n<p>The event will consist of five-minute presentations on budget updates by administrators followed by a Q&amp;A session. According to Dor, the A.S. Office of the President plans to use student input from the forum to develop future budget policies.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to decide ourselves what is important for the student body,” Dor said. “Our role is to find out what the student body wants and then advocate for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/","id":3132,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3131,3130,3129],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legislative Council Discusses Next Year’s Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing the specifics of their impacted 2011-2012 budget.

Representatives deliberated over the most effective areas to make cuts, focusing on honoraria and ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Most of the debate centered on whether finances for the proposed A.S. Isla Vista Annex would come from unallocated funds or the budgets of various A.S. subcommittees that have already donated about $40,000 collectively. Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said requiring further funding from committees would limit their ability to function.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I don’t like taking most of it from committees,” Mayorga said. “They’ve already invested so much in the space and cutting their budget is going to hurt the work they will be doing in the space. The money should come out of unallocated [funds].”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz said funding from committees is a necessary means of determining whether or not the project is viable.</p>\n<p>“This is really a trial run — a chance for us to see if this is something beneficial so if it doesn’t work we can pull out,” Lantz said. “The committees want this to happen and will do everything in their power to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>However, Lantz said students should ultimately determine the project’s fate via a lock-in fee on next year’s Spring Election ballot.</p>\n<p>To absorb requisite cutbacks, Representative-at-Large Chloe Stryker said committee member’s honoraria should constitute a smaller portion of the association’s budget.</p>\n<p>“If you look at our budget, most of our fees are going towards honoraria,” Stryker said. “I don’t think that’s right. Members should be working out of good heart and because they want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>According to Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht, honoraria currently comprises an excessive portion of A.S. finances.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is the most expensive thing we pay for,” Lieberknecht said. “People give to this association to get something back and not just pay for our salaries.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated Finance Board’s request for $23,075 from next year’s unallocated budget, $19,000 of which would go toward the group’s honoraria.

Protesters carried signs imploring British Petroleum and the U.S. government to take responsibility for the crisis and address ongoing environmental concerns about the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>EAB co-chair Teal Riege, a fourth-year ecology and evolution major, said the April 2010 disaster — which killed 11, injured 17 and released an estimated five million barrels of oil into the Gulf — rocked the nation both culturally and ecologically.</p>\n<p>“We were socially, politically and environmentally destroyed after the spill,” Riege said. “We are still recovering, but this protest is to remind us that the government and BP still have not done enough to restore stability in the Gulf.”</p>\n<p>Riege said the protest was organized to highlight our national dependence on the companies that failed to take responsibility for causing the spill.</p>\n<p>“The oil spill devastated … the ocean and the Gulf still hasn’t recovered,” Riege said. “The spill ruined the lives of animals [and] made people have contempt toward BP and oil companies in general even though we’re dependent on them.”</p>\n<p>Protest organizer and EAB member Ally Gialketsis, a third-year history and environmental studies major, said advocating for a change in energy policy at Washington D.C.’s Power Shift protest earlier this month encouraged her to plan Wednesday’ protest.</p>\n<p>“After attending Power Shift, many of the students were talking about having protests on each of our campuses in commemoration of the BP oil spill,” Gialketsis said. “Most of the schools planned their protests at BP gas stations, but we thought we would reach more students through our walk.”</p>\n<p>While protesters carried posters claiming that over 6,000 animals were killed as a result of the spill, EAB member Sierra Moreno, a third-year environmental studies major, said the estimates may not represent the full extent of the destruction.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of cover-up done after the spill,” Moreno said. “Scientists have been speaking up and revealing that there was much more death and damage done than the numbers originally suggested.”</p>\n<p>Riege said they chose to keep the walk silent to express their mourning — rather than anger — about the incident.</p>\n<p>“We are not protesting out of hatred,” Riege said. “This is a peaceful protest.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While ASPB plans to release this year’s lineup in about two weeks, hip hop artist Cee Lo Green announced earlier this month on his website he would be performing at the festival.</p>\n<p>Special Events Coordinator Ali Abbas, a third-year political science major, said the theme of this year’s concert is “your fees, your festival.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that we are not allowing out-of-towners will mean a better experience for the students,” Abbas said. “They are really our priority.”</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto, a fourth-year black studies and art history major, said this year’s changes directly address student complaints.</p>\n<p>“After last year’s Extravaganza, Program Board received many complaints about the lines, the crowd and overall safety of the event,” Yamamoto said in an e-mail. “To remedy the students’ issues, we changed our policies.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College second-year Anne Gumina said the event’s exclusivity spares her from suffering through a potentially disappointing lineup.</p>\n<p>“I chose not to see [Cee Lo Green] at Coachella and I would choose not to see him at Extravaganza,” Gumina said. “Cee Lo Green … more like go ‘Cee’ Al Green, ‘cause he’s better, and you really can’t make sincere love to ‘Fuck You.’”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_36991\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit name=”Daily Nexus File Photo” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1512718368\" data-slb-group=\"36989\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36991\" data-attachment-id=\"36991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/extravaganza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=1808%2C971&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,971\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"extravaganza\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-36991\" title=\"extravaganza\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza-250x134.jpg?resize=250%2C134\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-36991\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previous Extravaganza artists include Ludacris, Rebelution, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros and Girl Talk.

Yamamoto said ASPB hopes this year’s modifications will make the day more enjoyable for UCSB students.\n<p>“Many students complained about the lines, having to wait hours just to get into the festival,” Yamamoto said. “By limiting the festival to UCSB only, we hope to create a more efficient system of entry.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Yamamoto said last year’s crowds caused several safety hazards for attendees and put dangerous stress on the area’s emergency services.</p>\n<p>“Last year, there were no ambulances available in the county for two hours because they were all at Extravaganza to aid the concert-goers,” Yamamoto said. “Most who were in need of paramedic assistance were out-of-towners.”</p>\n<p>Despite the exclusivity of this year’s festival, Abbas said he encourages the public to attend ASPB’s many other open performances.</p>\n<p>“We’re sorry that community members can’t participate in this event, but we have many other concerts and events that are open to the public,” Abbas said.</p>\n<p>ASPB helped coordinate the upcoming Chilla Vista festival, a showcase of local music and art which will be held in Ansiq’ Oyo’ Park on May 1 at noon.</p>\n<p>Yamamoto said the future of Extravaganza is yet to be determined pending students’ reaction to this year’s festival.</p>\n<p>“I think any changes made will be determined after we see how this year goes,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p>Students, faculty and staff members will be required to present an ACCESS card to enter the festival.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/","id":3135,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3134,3133,3132],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Reject Bulk of Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The results of the Spring Elections’ Campus Elections Commission ballot were released Friday, establishing one new fee and upholding five reaffirmations.

Finance Board on Monday, Hillel sought $1,700 from the council to organize its weekly Shabbat dinners and Kosher cookouts. However, the organization intended to spend $1,100 on cleaning fees and supplies for these events and only $600 for food.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Dina Varshavsky said 14 percent of the campus community is composed of Jewish students. She said these dinners are an important part of their heritage and should receive full funding.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez, on the other hand, said Hillel’s financial request was excessive.</p>\n<p>“I understand that they want a lot of people to come to their dinners,” Lopez said. “Personally I’d like to cut it down a lot because it is very spread out and we can only fund it so many times.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately allotted $50 to each event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, council members discussed investing $2,000 into the Chinese Internet company Qihoo 360 Tech. This investment was recommended by A.S. Investment Advisory Committee Representative Jordan Nuni and swiftly approved with no opposition.</p>\n<p>“This company is the number two browser and number one in mobile security,” Nuni said. “Their sales are up 82 percent right now and most of their money comes from advertising.”</p>\n<p>The council also recognized the resignation of Queer Commission Co-Chair Edgar Vargas.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said Vargas was initially considered for removal, but came before the council and resigned for personal reasons instead.</p>\n<p>“Basically it was a matter of internal issues about the leadership not being able to fulfill certain duties that they were expected to fill,” Del Cid said. “Eventually the commission decided the best way to do it was to ask Edgar to resign because he had other priorities in his personal life.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Duncan Kenney introduced a resolution to support the construction of a new Isla Vista annex. The community center would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space — computer lab and community garden, among other space for UCSB students to access in I.V. A pet project of the External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office, the building would costs $82,060 annually to operate, and needs $34,560 more to begin its initial year. The resolution was tabled indefinitely until financial issues were sorted out.</p>\n<p>Kenney said his bill was not seeking funding for the project, but a reaffirmation of Associated Students’ continued support for the plan.</p>\n<p>“It is important that we continue our support of the I.V. annex, despite some recent negative media attention,” Kenney said. “Personally, I want to make a long-term impact and this is something that will be good for committees to come and that we can come back to as alumni.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council approved three retroactive honoraria requests including $100 for Coastal Fund Graduate Representative Suzanne McFerran, $20 for the Tech Services Committee and $600 for Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis.

Voting will be accessible through GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major and current Student Advocate General, said he would promote transparency and student outreach within the association.</p>\n<p>“Most students have no clue about what A.S. is doing on campus or where their funds are going,” Weber said. “We need to streamline the information being sent out to our student population and provide a monthly or weekly report about where those fees are going.”</p>\n<p>Weber said he would also seek to confront a recent trend of student apathy.</p>\n<p>“There are significantly more people at the undie run every quarter than at the budget rallies and protests,” Weber said. “Gaucho spirit does exist, we just need to channel it so we can tackle big issues, like the budget cuts.”</p>\n<p>Democratic Process Party candidate Stanley Tzankov, a third-year political science major and current off-campus representative, said he would work to implement the “core four” ideas at the heart of DPP’s plans for A.S.</p>\n<p>“I will create solutions that make the most of our resources, utilize the Office of the President to organize projects and programs to reach out to our students, work on student retention rates and engage the administration, student body and local government to all work together, especially in this time of budget cuts,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Tzankov said his work reaching out to marginalized students prepared him well for the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>“The budget cuts over the last few years have hit the disadvantaged and minority population very hard; it can be seen in the retention rates,” Tzankov said. “I have worked on providing an emergency loan service to disadvantaged and financially marginalized students. As president, I will appoint a Commissioner of Diversity and Equity who would plan events work on publicity.”</p>\n<p>Bettering Our School System’s candidate Marcus Rochellle, a third-year political science major and current finance board member, said he would work on the smaller issues on campus as well as addressing major budget concerns.</p>\n<p>“I believe it’s important to address the issues around campus as well as the bigger budget issues,” Rochellle said. “Improving the way we register for classes and expanding the wireless internet on campus are ways we can take measurable steps to improve lives on a day-to-day basis.”</p>\n<p>Rochellle said student collaboration will be critical for devising realistic solutions to break the cycle of budget cuts that disadvantage UC students.</p>\n<p>“The greatest untapped resource on campus is the students,” Rochellle said. “We need to harness the passion and spirit of the student body to address these issues with a unified front. We can let the state legislature know how much money we can make as graduates of college and how higher education really benefits the state.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/","id":3159,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3158,3157,3156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leg Council Funds A.S.

Election Committee’s funding for their “Votetopia” campaign to mobilize student participation in the Spring Election during last night’s five-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The Council allocated additional funding for Votetopia from its Special Projects account to supplement the funding it received after originally requesting $7,543 from Finance Board to rent Corwin Pavilion and provide four times as many T-shirts for the event. The Council approved an allocation of $2,200 to the campaign, including $800 for free T-shirts, $360 for stickers and $200 for the results announcement.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair Sunjeet Gill said although over 40 percent of undergraduate students voted in last year’s Spring Election, she hopes the campaign will motivate an even higher turnout.</p>\n<p>“These shirts can be worn year after year and we thought the theme would be fun,” Gill said. “We want more and more of a percentage to get out and vote each year.”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said she thinks it will be difficult to distribute the T-shirts during the association’s four-day campaign.</p>\n<p>“I did a month-long campaign once and even then it was hard to give away T-shirts with heavy publicizing,” Mayorga said. “There are so many T-shirts being given out already that it might be an overload.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said he feels the Elections Committee has already spent an excessive amount on advertising for Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>“My main issue with this is that they paid almost $10,000 in ads,” Lopez said. “People who read the Nexus generally read it every day and they don’t need to see these ads in issue after issue.”</p>\n<p>Some representatives suggested cost-cutting options such as announcing election results at a smaller venue and using an MP3 player instead of hiring a DJ.</p>\n<p>The Council also passed a Resolution to Support the Execution of the Student-Initiated Democratic Education, a program that would allow undergraduate students to teach pass/no pass seminars.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Council approved a Resolution to Support the Implementation of the A.S. Food Bank. According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the food bank will be operational shortly.</p>\n<p>The Council continued discussion about plans for their Isla Vista Annex and A.S. café. An informational meeting about the café will be held in the MultiCultural Center’s Multi-Purpose Room on April 28.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/","id":3160,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3159,3158,3157],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fees Return for Approval, Crowd Ballot","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Various campus programs and organizations are asking for the reaffirmation of 31 separate lock-in fees totaling to about $552 per year in the upcoming Spring Election.

In order to receive continued funding, the initiatives must secure a successful re-vote from the campus community every two years. Students can vote for A.S. candidates, new lock-in fees and reaffirmations via GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Advisor Aaron Jones, the A.S. associate director for community affairs, said lock-in fees were established ‘by the students, for the students’ to alleviate university-wide budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“The lock-ins were proposed and voted on by students, so over the past couple of years, when the money has dried up throughout the university, the students voted to instill a lock-in to save these types of programs,” Jones said. “Right now, things are really tight and students are being asked to bear more of the burden, but supporting the reaffirmations will not increase student fees because they are already locked in. [The reaffirmations] are great because the students can physically see the benefit.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1) KCSB/KJUC requests the reaffirmation of a $2.80 fee per student per quarter and $2.90 fee for summer.

Program Board calls for the approval of a continued $11.50 fee per student per quarter, $1.50 of which would be allotted for financial aid.</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto said the board provides student amenities like free Tuesday night movies and low-priced concerts. Notable ASPB acts have included The Killers, Nas, Fleet Foxes, Cascada, Three 6 Mafia and Ludacris.</p>\n<p>“If you think about it, for $12 you can go see a movie once, but for [less than] $12 a quarter you can go to nine movie screenings and much more,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4) The UC Student Association seeks a continued $3.02 fee per student per quarter and $2.90 fee for summer, $0.67 of which would be distributed to financial aid.

We try to keep our prices at or below other shops to help out.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7) Community Affairs Board requests a $2.62 fee per student per quarter and $2.24 fee for summer, $0.37 of which would be allotted for financial aid.

The association provides I.V. residents a resource to seek council when troubled by housing issues or landlords.</p>\n<p>Chair Sara Vandenbelt said the organization is completely free to I.V. residents and attempts to punctually and effectively help local tenants.</p>\n<p>“Tenants are too easily taken advantage of and IVTU is there to help when you have problems, but because we do exist we really do keep these problems at bay in the first place,” Vandenbelt said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14) The A.S. Legal Resource Center asks students to reaffirm a fee of $1.90 per student per quarter and $1.40 for summer, $0.10 of which would be allotted for financial aid.

Spring Election forums will continue next Tuesday through Thursday and students can vote for candidates and lock-in fees on GOLD from April 18 to 21.</p>\n<p>Mostafa and Madarang discussed budget cuts, giving a voice to underrepresented student groups and proposed expanding student lobbying efforts in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>If elected, Mostafa said his main goal would be protecting students’ accessibility to higher education.</p>\n<p>“I see in this room a group of students that all share a common goal: to get an affordable, quality education,” Mostafa said. “My overarching goals are to unify the student body, staff and administrators. These budget cuts affect us all and together we can all mobilize over the common goal of protecting our educations. We need to tell legislatures true stories of how budget cuts have affected students and make our stories truly heard.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she plans to promote student involvement in UC Board of Regents decisions.</p>\n<p>“I would like to expand lobbying efforts both at the capital and in the local area to make sure that money goes to our school system,” Madarang said. “Students should be in the forefront of every decision made on this campus. There should be another student seat on the Regents so that we have more representation in decisions made for us by the UC Regents.”</p>\n<p>Mostafa said he would also strive to make the EVPSA office more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“I want every student to know what the office is and that every student can come in and be exposed to it,” Mostafa said. “I would restructure positions and create positions that advocate for student groups on campus that are underrepresented on [Associated Students] such as the engineering department and the Greek community. I want a campus that knows what the EVPSA office is and a campus that participates in our events.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she fears that California Governor Jerry Brown’s budget cuts will make a UC education unaffordable in the future.</p>\n<p>“[Tuition increases] would make a college education unattainable for many students,” Madarang said. “I have successfully lobbied Gavin Newsom’s staff and other governing bodies and would encourage students to become involved in protecting their education.”</p>\n<p>Audience member Tiffany Mayville, an off-campus representative and fourth-year environmental studies major, said the election forums reveal how prepared each candidate is for his or her prospective position.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes students come forward and want a position, but don’t know what the office really entails,” Mayville said. “Forums show us whether a candidate knows the position they’re running for and therefore how well they’ll do in that position.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/","id":3158,"author":{"id":215,"name":"Christina Lavingia"},"related":[3157,3156,3155],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The council also voted down a resolution condemning a racially themed party organized by a UC Irvine fraternity last November.</p>\n<p>Finance Board chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board slashed next year’s budget from $672,496 to $400,695 in order to accommodate three new advisors and one part-time position.</p>\n<p>According to Lieberknecht, if every Boards, Committees and Commissions’ budget was fully allocated next year, finance board would be left with a $300,000 deficit in its unallocated fund.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that A.S. does not have money — because it does — but we need to account for the growth of positions because we are still receiving the same amount of money,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Lieberknecht said the budget should signify the association’s priorities.</p>\n<p>“Cuts are inevitable at every level of the budget process,” Lieberknecht said. “We had to make cuts, the president is going to have to make cuts and [Leg Council] is going to have to make cuts.”</p>\n<p>The budget is currently under review by A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez and will be made public within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lieberknecht said BCCs have been breaking the A.S. Constitution by funding Office of Student Life groups’ travel expenses and over $500 for food without administering one-time exceptions.</p>\n<p>“When BCCs are funding OSL groups there is a lot of policy-breaking and it’s usually not caught until it gets to admin and it’s already passed through minutes and Leg Council,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Alfredo Del Cid, university-owned housing representative, suggested developing a uniform process for requesting finances.</p>\n<p>“I think it would help if there was a streamlined process for funding,” Del Cid said. “I’ve been to multiple committee meetings and some have you give a form to the treasurer and some just bring it up in meetings.”</p>\n<p>The council decided not to condemn the actions of Irvine’s Phi Kappa Psi that held a Pilgrims and Indians -themed party last year.</p>\n<p>Del Cid, who authored the resolution, said the UCI administration still hasn’t taken action against the frat.</p>\n<p>“This is not an attack on the fraternity, but on the action,” Del Cid said. “We’re not telling them what to do, but that we stand in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>However, Yeni Nguyen, off-campus representative, said the council has no reason to target this specific party.</p>\n<p>After the resolution failed, Off-Campus Representative Amanda Berry said future resolutions should address all parties of this nature.</p>\n<p>“If we’re going to take a stand on this, then take a stand and make it general that ‘We don’t support any parties that do this’ instead of ‘We don’t support this particular party that had this specific theme,’” Berry said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/","id":3156,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3155,3154,3153],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also talked about problems within the council maintaining healthy attendance at meetings.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, A.S. associate director for community affairs, said the Isla Vista Community Collaborative — composed of parents, teachers and groups that tackle issues facing local children of kindergarten age and older — conducted extensive research revealing that local children don’t have access to nutritious food.</p>\n<p>“The collaborative did a survey on access to healthy food and the results were eye-opening,” Jones said. “There are zero supermarkets, no farmer’s markets, three small markets — one of which is called Keg-N-Bottle — and 19 fast food outlets.”</p>\n<p>However, Jones said the sustainable café with local, organic and free trade food that A.S. plans to open next school year on Pardall Road could provide families in I.V. with healthier food options.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Alfredo Del Cid, on the other hand, said low-income families won’t be able to afford food served at an organic eatery.</p>\n<p>“When we talked about the restaurant, every time I hear organic and healthy then comes the conversation of it being more expensive,” Del Cid said. “It’s easier for me to go and get two tacos for $0.99 than to buy an organic meal. I would like to have a conversation about this because Dan [La Berge] who drafted the plan did say it would be more expensive and I want to talk about how we can make it more affordable for these families.”\tAdditionally, the council discussed the transportation dilemma for local families who cannot afford automobiles face.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said Environmental Affairs Board could potentially offer free bicycles that would provide low-income families easier access to supermarkets in Goleta and Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Last year EAB set up a special auction with [the Community Service Organization] and bought bikes and then taught families how to fix them up and then gave them the bikes,” Mayville said. “CSO impounds thousands of bikes that are just abandoned every year on campus so we should do something with them.”</p>\n<p>Jones also said youths growing up in I.V. are often negatively influenced by college students’ lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“The living style in I.V. is an issue too,” Jones said. “There are very young youths developing substance abuse problems because they are drinking what is left in bottles that they pick up for recycling with families.”</p>\n<p>The board also debated at length problems facing the council, including members’ poor attendance and inattentiveness during public comment sessions.</p>\n<p>Del Cid said he couldn’t remember a single meeting that was attended by all elected representatives.</p>\n<p>“I understand that things happen and sometimes people can’t make it to meetings,” Del Cid said. “It says in our bylaws though that after school, this is our first priority. So be accountable; we’re not kids.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/","id":3157,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3156,3155,3154],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New A.S.

The 4,270 square-foot space, which may open as early as next month, will also include community resources for UCSB students including a computer lab as well as rooms for studying, recreation and tutoring.</p>\n<p>Cori Lantz, A.S. external vice president of local affairs and a fourth-year political science major, said the new office will provide the student body amenities that can currently  only be found on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do more outreach to students and families in Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “This is a really amazing resource that [I.V.] needs.”</p>\n<p>Megan Shumate, Isla Vista Community Relations Committee chair, said the annex will also provide a meeting space for A.S. entities that currently don’t have a residence.<br>\n“Our committee deals just with Isla Vista and its relations on and off campus so we’re really excited to finally have a home in Isla Vista,” Shumate said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Affairs Board Chair Amanda Galvin said the Family Literacy Program will greatly benefit from the space. Galvin also said the tutoring service will now be accessible to more I.V. families as its new location will be an ideal middle-ground between families and student tutors.</p>\n<p>“This program is helping elementary students through tutoring given by UCSB students,” Galvin said. “We’re moving all our offices for it out to the new space.”<br>\nLantz said the money devoted to the project will circulate back to the community.</p>\n<p>“The money that’s paid towards rent will go back into a public agency so the money has been committed to the development of Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “It could go towards lighting or repaving of streets so the aesthetics of Isla Vista will be improved.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC and C.A.B. each distributed $24,000 for the new space, while A.S. Legislative Council dispensed $3,000 and the Student Commission On Racial Equality distributed another $1,273. Nearly $33,000 of annual funding is needed to move ahead with the project, and the external vice president of local affairs office and 12 other A.S.
