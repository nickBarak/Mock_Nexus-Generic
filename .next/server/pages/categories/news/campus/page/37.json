Senators Sophia Dycaico and Brooke Kopel authored the resolution, and Brant and fellow Lobby Corps member Madeline Loudon student-sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>In January, students across the UC system traveled to the UC regents meeting to protest the proposed tuition hike. Brandt and several other UCSB students were present when the regents voted to postpone the vote until May.</p>\n<p>“A lot of regents were convinced that the UC should lobby the state for more funding before raising the tuition, so we’re at a really important opportunity where we could actually get more funding from the state,” Dycaico said. “That could stop the tuition hike.”</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the cost of college has risen “dramatically” over the past 30 years, “outpacing the cost of medical care, real estate, child care and household appliances” and “forcing 55% of UC students to take on thousands of dollars in loans.”</p>\n<p>“Tuition is — if not the number one problem — one of the largest problems that students face,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>She added that “college is already too expensive” and said that the resolution will help pressure the UC Regents and Governor Brown to stop the tuition hikes and to create a federal budget that works in the students’ interests.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the California governor’s 2018-2019 budget proposal does not including “adequate funding” for enrollment growth, psychological counselors, facility maintenance, student resources, health services, research equipment, academic tutoring and other needs.</p>\n<p>The UC receives the “same inflation-adjusted amount of funding from the State of California than it did in 2000, despite enrolling 90,000 more students in 2017 than it did in 2000,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for the California State Assembly, the California State Senate and the Governor of California to appropriate $10 million in funding to support the costs of education for an additional 2,500 students that the UC is required to enroll next year.</p>\n<p>Also requested are $35 million for “instruction and research facilities maintenance projects” and $71 million to supplement the proposition tuition and fee increase.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that proposed funding numbers in the resolution came from a 2018-2019 UC budget request submitted in February.</p>\n<p>The request states that funding is needed for “urgent projects” on campus, including fixing classrooms and updating labs. The university is also requesting funds to help deal with larger class sizes, the student to faculty ratio and increased demand on student services.</p>\n<p>“The investment will fund improvements to ensure student success and timely graduation,” the request states.</p>\n<p>The UC’s backlog exceeds $4 billion and is the third largest among all state agencies, according to the request.</p>\n<p>With the passing of the resolution, “We’re going to be doing a lot more in terms of letter writing, postcard writing, making calls. We’re definitely going to include in [the letters] that our campus stands behind these asks,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

part of a series of 12 demands that would increase comunity safety regarding sexual assault. The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would recieve support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The demand calls for a survivor resource center that will “lead programming efforts to spread awareness among the student body and throughout the off campus Isla Vista community.”</p>\n<p>The center will also require a full-time director and staff, as well as legal service for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>Students at the Tuesday’s meeting asked that the center be effective for underrepresented communities, which they said should help in creating and managing the center.</p>\n<p>The university requested $56,000 to secure the help of the Alliance for HOPE, a nonprofit agency that develops family justice centers to protect and heal sexual assault survivors and their families.</p>\n<p>The university submitted the funding request in December, but the status will not be known until “spring time” of this year, said C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway during the meeting.</p>\n<p>An additional assessment proposal provides a “blueprint” for all constituents involved in planning the creation of a survivor resource center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>Students expressed concern that collaborating with outside entities might not be effective in authentically representing the marginalized communities that the center aims to support.</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Jasmine Lee said a more concrete timeline of the two-year assessment proposal and the university funding request status would help student organizers search for alternate sources of funding.</p>\n<p>She said the university needs to communicate with students about the financing process so they can take action as the funding comes through.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, Dean of Student Life, said during the meeting that it can be “helpful to bring in an outsider to facilitate” the creation of the center.</p>\n<p>Armistead also said the university must apply for grants in order to build the center. But the university already has other grants lined up, which might delay the approval of a grant for the center, she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao requested that the center be part of the Associated Students Boards, Commissions and Units so the center can work closely and partner with student organizations and campus departments.</p>\n<p>“This is not going to be C.A.R.E. out in I.V.,” Conway said, referring to the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education program. “This is a separate, distinct resource.” Conway also explained that the center will be its own entity, independent from existing UCSB sexual assault survivor resources.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. will still be a “strong partner” moving forward with the center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be bigger than just C.A.R.E.,” she said.</p>\n<p>There will be a follow-up meeting to further discuss the demand on March 6 at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/","id":2328,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2327,2326,2325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Transfer Student Alliance To Receive A.S.

Senate liaisons to the organization.</p>\n<p>The four worked on the resolution during Fall Quarter and filed a motion to get the TSA certified as a BCU.</p>\n<p>The amount of funding the TSA will receive is still being discussed. According to Armada, Maalizadeh first suggested that the budget should be around $20,000, but then expectations were lowered to $10,000.</p>\n<p>When the TSA was an entity of the Office of Student Life (OSL), their budget was no larger than $500, Armada explained.</p>\n<p>Prior to the TSA becoming an A.S. entity, they received their funding solely from fundraisers and donations.</p>\n<p>“We had to spend a lot of time raising money before we even put on events,” Nielson said.</p>\n<p>The TSA had their first meeting as a BCU on Monday, Feb. 12. Armada said he had seen an increase in membership since the TSA officially became a BCU.</p>\n<p>“It’s small now, but I’m hoping that their interest will keep growing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re one of the only UCs who didn’t have a transfer organization as a part of the Associated Students… That was shocking to me considering how many transfer students are being accepted, and it’s only increasing each year,” he added.</p>\n<p>The previous board of the TSA had intended to make their organization an entity of A.S., but failed to do so due to a lack of guidance from Senate, according to Nielson.</p>\n<p>With the help of Maalizadeh and Ochoa, the TSA was able to draft the proposal and complete the internal paperwork needed.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the things we want to do is just advocate for resources. With transfers, there’s no centralized voice,” Maalizadeh said. “There’s only so much a single person can do, but there’s so much that an organized group can do.”</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh envisions the TSA using its position in A.S. not just to hold community events, but also to advocate for resources such as more tutoring services and a better transfer student orientation.</p>\n<p>The TSA plans to work with the Transfer Student Center (TSC) by collaborating on events and utilizing the resources provided by the center.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I am a Transfer Peer Educator at the TSC, and I felt a division with the two even though we are serving the same constituents,” Ochoa said. “Now, I hope having a TSC liaison with the TSA will create more of a bond and collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>All four authors of the resolution emphasized that they hope to see transfer students having a larger presence on campus now that they have adequate representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“Transfers come from everywhere, but we all have the same common identity of being a transfer,” Maalizadeh said. “I want to make sure that when people go to UCSB as a transfer, they aren’t an afterthought.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg.4 of the Feb. 15 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

there was a 50 percent increase in attendance for weekly Students for Recovery 12-step open meetings, according to Angie Bryan, the GFR Recovery Program Manager.</p>\n<p>In response, GFR ​announced three new support groups for students and community members recovering from addiction. The new S.M.A.R.T. Recovery meeting and Graduate/Non-Traditional Student 12-step meeting diversify the organization’s approach, allowing for students with different paths and a more cognitive method of addressing addiction.</p>\n<p>GFR also began hosting an Alanon meeting for family members and loved ones affected by people with substance use disorders, who are either working or not working toward recovery.</p>\n<p>Bryan founded GFR in the fall of 2012 after working in the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program as a marriage and family therapist.</p>\n<p>After researching other campus-based collegiate recovery programs, Bryan found a similar program at Texas Tech University, which provided grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for replication programs on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in long-term recovery for 13 years so this is something that I was really interested in,” Bryan said. “So [SAMHSA] paid for me to go out there and see their program and see how we might start it here.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Behavioral Wellness Department agreed to contribute start-up funding for GFR after Bryan met someone within the department who “happened to be in long-term recovery also.”</p>\n<p>According to Bryan, UCSB is the only UC that has an Alcohol and Drug Program. The program has been around for nearly 10 years, which Bryan said shows that the university already recognizes that support is needed. She believes recovery fit naturally into the campus services.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been very lucky here because UCSB administration has always been really supportive of this program,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>“The 18-25 age group is the fastest growing number of people going for treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. So we’re seeing a lot more students coming to college already in recovery or students getting into recovery while in college,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>At the start of the program, there were less than 10 people in attendance, and now at least a few dozen show up for meetings, according to fourth-year physics major and peer-intern Noah Shachar.</p>\n<p>“So nationally it’s a huge trend that we’re seeing, which is why there’s over 100 schools across the country that have some form of collegiate recovery support,” Bryan said. “We’re definitely one of the leaders in the country in development and what we have to offer here in our program.”</p>\n<p>GFR also hosts “sober events” for students to get out of I.V., including two camping trips a year, as well as “unity events,” Shachar said.<br>\nThe camping trips are organized in Spring Quarter around Deltopia and in Fall Quarter around Halloween. Bryan said these trips provide students alternative spaces when Isla Vista “isn’t a recovery-friendly environment.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody is mandated to come to our program; it’s all people that want our support on a voluntary basis,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>Advocacy work helps change campus culture and reduce the stigma that a person in recovery is a “stereotypical addict,” Shachar and Bryan agreed.</p>\n<p>“When we use the term ‘person in recovery’ it sounds like someone that is trying to make some changes and are goal-oriented toward recovery… Someone in recovery is constantly in recovery and constantly improving upon themselves,” Shachar said. “We’re here to show people that you can start doing that at any time, at any age, in any situation — if that’s what you want.”</p>\n<p>GFR just ended its last year in contract with the county Behavioral and Wellness department because of policy changes. It is uncertain where funding will come from next year. However, Bryan said she is not worried because of support from the university and acquired grants.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to trust that things will happen because so far in developmental programs that’s just how things work,” Bryan said. “Right when we think something isn’t going to work, something always comes out of the work, and we go from there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

in Baja, California, surrounded by their travel mementos. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>On Monday night, UC Santa Barbara alumni Daniel Connell and Quincy Lee settled in for a night of sleep at a fire station in Managua, Nicaragua, after an eight-hour bicycle ride through the Latin country.</p>\n<p>“We had a pretty crazy day,” Connell recounted with a laugh heard through the phone. “It was just hectic with a lot of wind and a lot of sun. We had to ride almost 100 miles, and I ended up getting a flat tire, but we made it to the fire station, which was our goal.”</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have been on the road biking since Oct. 20, 2017. After graduating from UCSB in the spring of 2017, the two saved up money from summer jobs and decided to embark on a trip from Isla Vista to Colombia, opting for a different mode of transportation than the average traveler.</p>\n<p>“I thought, ‘What better way than to bike there?’” Connell said. “And then I thought, ‘What friend do I have that’s crazy enough to take on an adventure like that as well?’ So I gave Quincy a call.”</p>\n<p>Lee considered the offer for about 10 seconds before saying, “Yup, I’m down.”</p>\n<p>They started biking from the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, where Connell and Lee were met by friends who biked with them until they reached the edge of campus. They then rode through I.V. and onto campus, past the library and under Henley Gate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81116\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"636970733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81116\" data-attachment-id=\"81116\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_7054-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_7054\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81116\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Connell and Lee began their journey in Isla Vista, biking through town and campus before riding under Henley Gate. They made it to Malibu on their first day of biking. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>“Our first day, we rode out of I.V. through Santa Barbara. We ended up in Malibu that day, and up until that point, that was the longest bike ride of my life,” Lee said, adding that since then, he’s easily doubled the time he spends on his bike.</p>\n<p>“It was pretty significant because the last four years of our life were at UCSB,” Connell reflected. “That was our home, and it was a significant change to actually leave from that home to start this new segment of our lives.”</p>\n<p>After reaching the U.S. border, they spent 80 days exploring Mexico until they reached Belize. From there, they traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Monday night’s rest in Nicaragua was another stop on their journey as they prepare to bike through Costa Rica and Panama until reaching Colombia.</p>\n<p>But the two will remind you that it’s not really about the destination anymore, after having interacted with folks in numerous cities on their journey. They say they have experienced generosity, hospitality and love as they have been welcomed into the homes of strangers.</p>\n<p>“I think when we arrive in Colombia, we’re going to have a list of about 250 people we’ll need to call, like ‘We made it!’” Lee laughed. “Not even people from back home, but people we met along the way.”</p>\n<p>Connell says after 100 days on the road, they have not yet paid for a place to sleep, instead relying on the kindness of locals ― including families, firemen and policemen ― who welcome them into their homes and workspaces. Other nights, they have camped in parks, basketball courts, at bus stops or on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>They even strung a hammock between two broken semi-trucks one night.</p>\n<p>“And if it wasn’t the best rest I ever had,” Lee recalled.</p>\n<p>The bikers will admit that the most challenging part of the journey has been the biking itself; pedaling up rocky mountains for hours on end in extreme heat with bicycles that weigh about 140 pounds can take a toll.</p>\n<p>Both agreed the exercise has been as much a mental exertion as a physical one. Often, they ride on freeways with trucks whizzing past them, with a clamor of honking horns in the background.</p>\n<p>Lee once faced off with a bull in the middle of the road, remembering that its horn came within inches of his handlebars.</p>\n<p>He describes biking in these situations as a “mental game” that’s better than “any meditation [he’s] experienced ever before.”</p>\n<p>Connell said one of the best parts of the trip has been “breaking that social stigma” that people have about countries that are often portrayed in the media as dangerous.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81110\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1796918267\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81110\" data-attachment-id=\"81110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_2784/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2784\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81110\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bikers stayed in Belize for two weeks after a local man invited them to stay with him and his family in their home. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>Connell and Lee said they planned to go to an island in Belize for one day and ended up staying for two weeks after a man invited them to stay with him and his family.</p>\n<p>“It was something special because he lived on a separate island, and his daily commute from one island to the next was via his homemade sailboat that he made purely out of materials that he found on the beach where he lives,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They both agreed that Honduras has been their favorite country to visit so far, but only after some hesitation.</p>\n<p>“That’s a hard question!” they exclaimed in unison.

Connell and Lee’s goal of $5,000 would be enough money to donate 30 bikes to people around the world.

Despite the long journey they’ve already had, they aren’t tired — anyone could hear it through the excitement in their voices.</p>\n<p>In fact, the travel mementos they have packed keeps growing, adding more weight to their bags, although they would say it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>They currently are carrying a guitar, ukulele, multiple books, fins to help them swim, cooking supplies and even a backgammon set, Connell said.</p>\n<p>“We <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Lee reminded his friend.</p>\n<p>“Okay, we <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Connell conceded. “We recently lost that and it’s quite heartbreaking.”</p>\n<p>Yet it doesn’t seem to be the objects that have made this trip so worthwhile for Connell and Lee. Instead, it’s been the knowledge gained along the way, the change in their worldview and the strengthening of their own friendship.</p>\n<p>“After four years at UCSB, me and Quince, to put it in funny terms, were homies,” Connell chuckled. “We would hang out, but we never actually traveled together, and to go from that to sleeping within a foot of each other ― we’re like a married couple.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps at the end of the day, it comes down to a love of biking and a friendship that started at UCSB. One thing is for sure: Connell and Lee don’t seem to be braking anytime soon ― they are already planning their next trip, maybe biking through the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, or from Colombia to Patagonia at “the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>They have a few rides ahead of them to figure it out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/","id":2323,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2322,2321,2320],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting. It states that UCSB should partner with Sprigeo, a third-party vendor, to offer students a 24/7 mobile application, webform, text hotline, phone hotline and email hotline to report a crime.</p>\n<p>If the Senate passes the resolution, A.S. would establish a contract with Sprigeo for the service and “widely publicize” the app to incoming students as a way to report sexual assault on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of partnering with this company is that so many resources in Associated Students are available and we pay for them, but no students know they exist or they don’t know how to access them, and that’s a huge issue,” said Senator Kristen Armellini, who co-authored the resolution with Senator Grecia Martinez.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Matan Bostick sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>The Sprigeo app would allow students to anonymously report offenses that would then be processed by “designated university officials and [be] appropriately and confidentially responded to in prompt fashion,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs to be discussed further.</p>\n<p>Before voting, some senators expressed disappointment with how the subject was approached.</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse said that the Senate had last spoken to Bostick two weeks before, but that the updated resolution was “slapped on” the night before the meeting.</p>\n<p>She added that the resolution should have been created in conjunction with current student efforts to combat sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I have a problem with [the resolution] is that no one is doing anything unless it makes them look real good, or they care about it and they’re caring about it when they’re not prioritizing other issues,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The amount of time allotted to work on the resolution was also a point of concern for some senators because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>\n<p>“This resolution shouldn’t be worked in a week. It should be worked in one month, two months, three months,” Senator Andrea Reyes said.</p>\n<p>Another issue addressed was the use of the names of two UCSB alumni in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The alumni mentioned have previously hosted sit-ins regarding sexual assault. The first was held by Alejandra Melgoza in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2015</a> and lasted for 13 hours; the second was led by Ro’Shawndra Earvin in May 2017 and lasted for nine hours.</p>\n<p>In both instances, Chancellor Henry T. Yang agreed to the students’ <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respective demands</a>, although Earvin has continued fighting for the completion of the demands, most recently at a Feb. 8 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/sexual-assault-survivors-raise-frustrations-over-unresolved-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Town Hall meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Melgoza and Earvin said they were not contacted by the authors of the resolution or asked to have their names included.</p>\n<p>“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said during public forum.</p>\n<p>Armellini spoke about the intentions of the resolution, saying it came “prematurely” to the senate and that it “needs work”.</p>\n<p>“In no way was this resolution supposed to produce this anxiety and uproar,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students can report incidents of sexual assault through the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) if the incident occurs on campus or through the Title IX &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office. Local law enforcement like the Isla Vista Foot Patrol can address an incident if it occurred off campus.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) is another campus resource students can use to anonymously report sexual assault. Students can go online to file a report, which will then be forwarded to UCPD and other campus offices.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang during a May 2017 sit-in. Yang agreed to the demands but students are still concerned that the university has not taken enough action to reform sexual assault policies. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at a town hall on Thursday continued to express their frustration with UC Santa Barbara administration, which they say has not fully addressed previously agreed-upon demands to reform sexual assault policies at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall, hosted by Student Activist Network, addressed one of the demands, which requires UC President Janet Napolitano to tour sexual assault and sexual violence town halls on UC campuses once a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Holmes Sullivan, vice president for Student Affairs at the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), attended the town hall as a representative for Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students initially presented the demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang during at a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017 sit- in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These demands elaborated on a previous list of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which students presented to Yang at a May 2015 sit-in in Cheadle Hall. In both cases, Yang agreed to the students’ demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel was composed of UCSB administrators, Title IX Student Advisory Board representative Jennifer Selvidge and Ro’Shawndra Earvin, who led the initial sit-in when Chancellor Yang signed the 2017 list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang did not attend the meeting because he was in Sacramento advocating for UC funding, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn explained at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said Yang had made a personal commitment to Earvin prior to the town hall that he would raise money for the Survivor Fund at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, Earvin posted on social media a screenshot of an email she had sent to Yang, in which she told the chancellor that he had been unresponsive to her emails. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It worries me that you have not consistently followed up with the issues presented to you on that day,” she wrote. ”I am sure you understand that directing me to your assistants is insufficient, as your name is on the contract as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said all of the demands from 2015 had been addressed. Some of the demands from last May are still in progress, like a demand for a Survivor Resource Center and an Isla Vista report card for sexual assault incidents, she said. She suggested partnering with a family justice center to address the former demand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Selvidge disagreed with Klawunn and said three of the original 13 demands have still not been met. Selvidge, who told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she is a survivor of assault, read through the demands she considers incomplete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the demands requires increasing female presence on the I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and training all IVFP personnel to deal with sexual violence and harassment. Another states that there should be accountability and oversight of the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) for past mishandling of sexual assault cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still another of these demands requires placing an additional Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office (C.A.R.E.) advocate in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just need the university to run what they signed for,” Earvin said. “That’s the reason why I am here. Our agenda is ‘demand completion.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin also expressed frustration that her name had been used without her permission in an Associated Students (A.S.) Senate resolution. The resolution proposed using a mobile application called Sprigeo to combat sexual assault and sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Kristen Armellini and Grecia Martinez authored the resolution, which was presented at the Feb. 7 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never felt so disrespected,” Earvin said. “Apparently you had a story when you created the app, why did you use my story?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Feb. 7 meeting, UCSB alumna Alejandra Melgoza also expressed concern  because her name was mentioned in the resolution without her permission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Alexandra Gessesse and Andrea Reyes said the authors of the resolution should have approached the individuals before including their names. Gessesse said that regardless of when the resolution was written, the fact that Earvin and Melgoza had not been contacted was “exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin emphasized that her main initiative since the May sit-in was to fulfill the list of demands, including full payment of her UC tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Run that tuition and run this resource center,” Earvin said. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

the UC Santa Barbara campus liasions for the advisory board. The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures. <em>Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The advisory board met for the first time on Monday in Oakland, and attendees discussed prevention education, communication and outreach on campuses and what these policies look like now on all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Selvidge, a materials engineering graduate student was present at the meeting, but Tanaka, a fourth-year philosophy and sociology double major, was unable to attend.</p>\n<p>The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures and will have “less input” on legal interpretation of the federal statute, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>System-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty told the <em>Nexus</em> that the<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\"> creation of the board</a> was proposed when she took office in Feb. 2017.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s been a lot going on at the UCSB campus, but what I want to make sure is that we have some sort of healthy and open line of communication to the people who actually control the policy, if it’s a system-wide policy issue,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le, who was on the selection committee for the formation of the board, said the board looked for applicants who were actively working on sexual assault and sexual violence issues.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for candidates who … had the experience and also had the relationships already built in to be able to interface with these groups on the campus-based level and to be able to relay what our campus concerns are to the system wide efforts,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The board was asked to connect with their campus Title IX and Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) offices prior to the meeting. They were also told to solicit feedback from students on direct Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>According to Selvidge, she has been the head graduate student for nowUCSB, which is a sexual violence organization that’s entirely student-run and independent of the university.</p>\n<p>Selvidge said she spent a lot of time working on increasing awareness of domestic violence and dating, an issue which especially affects graduate students, many of whom are in long-term relationships.</p>\n<p>While at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate student, Selvidge said she was assaulted by a student and also harassed by a professor.</p>\n<p>“S.T.E.M. has a lot of sexual harassment and sexual assault that sort of gets swept under the rug, in part because it’s such a heavily male-dominated field,” she added. “I would like to see the expansion of the definitions of sexual assault and sexual harassment and especially dating violence and domestic violence because they’re currently exclusively related to force or threat of force.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge also hopes the board can talk to campus faculty and get them to understand that the concept of statute of limitations is concerning, especially when the state of California does not legally have a statute of limitations for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>As a queer-identifying individual, Selvidge believes the queer community has higher barriers in relation to assault reporting similar to the undocumented community, who may not feel safe reporting to the police, as “there’s all these nuanced issues with different communities,” she said.</p>\n<p>Selvidge is optimistic about the future of the board.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think we’ll get something out of it,” she said. “How big, how broad-reaching, how many ‘somethings,’ I don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Tanaka said that as an undergraduate, she hopes the Student Advisory Board will be a way for other undergraduates who have concerns about how the Title IX Office handles cases feel comfortable approaching the board with their concerns and feel heard.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, I had a friend who confided in me about an assault, and I really didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to help her,” Tanaka said. “I went and talked to some people at C.A.P.S. asking, ‘What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to help her?’”</p>\n<p>Tanaka went on to do training with the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center and worked as an advocate for their crisis hotline, directly advising survivors.</p>\n<p>Last Winter Quarter, Tanaka interned with C.A.R.E. through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Program.</p>\n<p>“We set up a campaign in I.V. to help educate people who worked at alcohol-serving establishments to spread the right kind of ways to intervene in a situation that could be potentially dangerous, as far as sexual violence goes because we figured a lot of the times out here, alcohol is involved,” Tanaka said.</p>\n<p>The advisory board will be meeting again in April and will be holding a series of phone calls in between regarding specific policy issues.</p>\n<p>“I think in terms of system-wide policy issues, students at UCSB should use their student advisory board representatives as a way to communicate those concerns,” Salvaty said. “If it’s a campus-specific issue, I hope they bring those up, too because I think it might be more helpful to raise issues at a system-wide level and see if we can solve it as a system.”</p>\n<p><em>A version

id=\"caption-attachment-80843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zahira Kelly-Cabrera (center) spoke about her experiences as an Afro-Latina woman and her own struggles with self identity. <em>Courtesy of the Womxn’s Commission</em></p></div>\n<p>Womxn of color and their allies came together for this year’s Womxn of Color Conference on Saturday, Feb. 3, to discuss the issues minority womxn face with media representation, mental health and generational trauma.</p>\n<p>This year’s theme, “From Ashes to Activism: Rise through Resistance,” was reflected in the speakers, workshops and caucus spaces held throughout the day. The Associated Students Womxn’s Commission hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Ilene Ochoa, a fourth-year sociology major and senate liaison to the Womxn’s Commission, said the event was important for womxn of color in the present political climate.</p>\n<p>“The board liked the idea of rising from the ashes, being reborn like a phoenix, because even though you’ve gone through hardships, you still come out strong,” Ochoa said in an email.</p>\n<p>Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an Afro-Dominicana writer, artist and international speaker, kicked off the event with a compelling speech about being an Afro-Latina.</p>\n<p>Kelly-Cabrera talked about her struggles with self-identity and with being marginalized even within her own Latinx community. She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-67899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Last year’s Dance Marathon raised approximately $16,000 for the hospital. <em>Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Dance Marathon (UCSBDM) will be holding its annual GauchoThon event on Feb. 10 in the Rob Gym, which will benefit the Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units at Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Medical Center.</p>\n<p>Check in will begin at 11:30 a.m. and the event officially starts at noon.</p>\n<p>“GauchoThon is kind of like a jog-a-thon, but a dance-a-thon instead,” Zareena Zaidi, director of entertainment and co-director of marketing for the Dance Marathon at UCSB, in an email. “It’s just about having fun and supporting the kids.”</p>\n<p>According to Zaidi, the main idea of GauchoThon is simply to “stand for the kids who can’t.” Various UCSB groups are brought in to perform, play games and do other activities to entertain participants throughout the twelve-hour event.</p>\n<p>“We have kids — who are alive today because of the care they received from the hospital — come and tell their story, which I think is really impactful,” Zaidi said.</p>\n<p>“Miracle Childs,” or those who have received life-saving treatment at CCMC, will be at the event to share their stories and possibly dance with students. Zaidi believes that having the “Miracle Childs” in attendance helps connect participants with the cause and highlight how their fundraising is helping CCMC.</p>\n<p>CCMC hosts numerous fundraising events throughout the year, with GauchoThon being the finale of their year-long efforts and a celebration of the kids and the participants who fundraise.</p>\n<p>Ann Peyrat, liaison with CCMC, explained that the Dance Marathon at UCSB “provides a place for students to ‘belong’” while also benefiting other nonprofits on campus by “giving them a tabling opportunity to spotlight their mission.”</p>\n<p>Peyrat also explained that UCSB students volunteer countless hours for the cause.</p>\n<p>“UCSBDM members ‘table’ on campus, visit classrooms, residence halls, clubs and Greek life and host events. They take on leadership roles, form committees, hold weekly meetings and coordinate everything from catering, sponsorship, marketing, social media, entertainment, performances and visits from now healthy CCMC patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, UCSBDM and GauchoThon have raised over $60,000 to support Cottage Hospital’s Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units.</p>\n<p>Zaidi said that there is no fundraising goal for this year, “just to raise as much as [they] possibly can.”</p>\n<p>Individual entry for the event requires a $5 donation to CCMC and registration information can be found on the events’ Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Even if students can’t make it out to this year’s event, there are still ways to donate and get involved. Donations will remain open until March and can be submitted on the events’ Facebook page. Registration for next year’s event will open up as early as Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>“[UCSBDM students] are this generation fighting for the next. We couldn’t be more honored to have the support of Dance Marathon at UCSB,” Peyrat said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Department of Public Health’s Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Weekly Report for Jan. 7 to 13, 2018 reported that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses are more widespread  this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Influenza A (H3N2) strain tends to cause larger outbreaks compared to other strains of the flu, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali Javanbakht, the medical director at UCSB Student Health, said Cottage Hospital in Goleta has seen a sharp rise in the number of flu cases. Other hospitals in counties across California are experiencing elevated numbers of cases as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 20,000 people die in the U.S. from the flu every year, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As of now, improving flu vaccination rates is our best bet at reducing that number,” Javanbakht said in an email. “We’re always looking for ways to boost flu vaccination rates at UCSB since there are a lot of people on campus in close quarters, which can really lend itself to an outbreak.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Aug. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2018, UCSB Student Health administered 1,862 flu vaccines. In the same time period last year, UCSB Student Health had administered 1,794  vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help boost these rates, UCSB Student Health offers flu vaccination clinics. Their walk-in hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. An express flu clinic is also available by appointment and is held on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California Department of Public Health said vaccinating is the best protection against the influenza virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s hard for young, healthy college students to feel the need to get the flu vaccine, but getting a flu vaccine yourself helps protect your ‘tribe’ Javanbakht said in an email. “By getting vaccinated, you become one fewer entry points of the flu virus into your circle of friends, roommates, classmates, significant others, and family members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a drastic decrease in the number of flu cases if 95 percent of the campus were vaccinated, according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This would mean fewer missed class days, fewer missed exercise days, fewer missed socializing days, and more healthcare resources available to tend to other ill or injured students,” he said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still possible to catch the flu if a person receives the flu vaccine, Javanbakht said those who are vaccinated and fall ill tend to be ill for a shorter amount of time and experience less extreme symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht reported that the majority of the flu cases UCSB Student Health sees are in students who haven’t received the vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when sick in order to stop the spread of the flu. Javanbakht also said using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands is effective, especially before eating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking care when touching surfaces where the flu virus can reside, such as doorknobs, tables, pens, paper, ATM, keyboards, etc., and using a hand sanitizer after doing so can also be very effective,” Javanbakht said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that “getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising regularly all help to keep the immune system functioning better overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/","id":2760,"author":{"id":208,"name":"Rachael Grand"},"related":[2759,2758,2757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

mental illness during the Feb. 2 meeting. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee on Feb. 2 in response to the resolution passed on Jan. 24 in support of mentally disabled students in on-campus housing.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held by Senators Alison Sir and Anthony Pimentel and concluded with a plan to continue the discussion with university administrators and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)</p>\n<p>Sir read off an anonymous testimony from a student who removed from university housing due to a mental disability.</p>\n<p>“When I met with Housing and Judicial Affairs, they said I was banned because I violated the Personal Care Clause and my agreement, even though it was due to my mental illness,” Sir read from the testimony.</p>\n<p>The meeting began with a public forum to allow students of the UC Santa Barbara community to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of people who have had to go to Tropicana because of this clause and I’m here to say that as a personal representative of the RHA Coordinating Board, I’m just here to support you guys,” said Kevin Sabellico, San Rafael Hall Council Co-President.</p>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, Chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), added that he needs to “make sure this is an appropriate goal for IVTU to be a part of.”</p>\n<p>In the approved plan of action, senators will split into three groups to collect information regarding the “Personal Care Clause” to present at a Town Hall meeting with the UCSB community in two weeks, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Three senators will meet with Housing and Residential Services, a second group will meet with C.A.P.S., and a third group will meet with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80789\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80789\"

referencing to the vague justifications used to remove students from Housing.</p>\n<p>During their meeting with C.A.P.S., the senators plan to discuss the training provided to Residential Life staff on handling mental health issues and C.A.P.S.’s role in helping students who may struggle with mental illness, according to Sir.</p>\n<p>The council also plans to gather and release testimonies from students who attend C.A.P.S. for review and potential policy changes.</p>\n<p>Sir clarified that their intentions are not to discourage students from using C.A.P.S., calling it a “great student resource” that simply needs improvement.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said Senators speaking with administration plan to gather information on UCSB’s involvement in dealing with these issues.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a very productive and efficient meeting that allowed Alison and myself to hear the public’s thoughts and perspectives about this issue and allowed us to direct the Committee members onto the plan of action to combat the poorly written Personal Care clause,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel encourages all students to attend the future Town Hall meeting.

Building on Saturday, providing a space to discuss what it means to be a minority womxn and promote self love . <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students’ Womxn’s Commission will be hosting its annual Womxn of Color Conference this Saturday, Feb. 3, honoring self-identifying women of color while bringing awareness to their intersectional struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conference will be composed of workshops, speakers and free meals and it will last from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Workshops will address issues such as navigating what it means to be a minority womxn and promoting self-love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the conference’s sixth consecutive year at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an AfroDominicana writer, artist and international speaker, will kick off the conference by speaking about white-supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy and what it means to minority women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera is an award-winning sociocultural critic who specifically focuses on the AfroLatina sector of intersectional feminism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her work has been featured in publications such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Kelly-Cabrera has also held lectures and panels at universities such as New York University and has hosted a TEDx talk in Mexico. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of the Womxn’s Commission executive board anticipate that her appearance will be a noteworthy way to begin the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our keynote speaker is a badass, and I’m sure after hearing her speak we will all be pumped up and ready to get the day started,” third-year political science and art double major Siboney Arias, a Herstorian on the board, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera’s speech will be followed by two workshop sessions and a caucus space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Session A and B will each have nine workshops that cater to every self-identifying attendees through specialized topics, including self-love/care, white supremacy and intercultural struggles of colored women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other workshops are aimed at building skill through career identity and vision building, such as the “Discovering my Career Identity” workshop, presented by a speaker named Monique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB will be also be hosting its own “Herstories” through a music workshop, during which Radio Xicana will give tips on how to use the radio as a platform for women of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People should look forward to meeting some powerful and strong womxn that take shit from no one. They should look forward to learning about different issues that they aren’t familiar with,” Arias said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caucus spaces will succeed the workshops and serve as a time to debrief and intermingle with individuals of shared identities, according to Arias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many workshops are open to all, but some spaces specify the identifications they are open to. The Womxn of Color Conference website explains the status of each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Womxns’ Commission reminds interested individuals to register online to ensure plenty of food and t-shirts for everyone. Attendees will be provided breakfast, lunch and dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am passionate about creating spaces for people to learn, grow, and feel safe. It’s very important to me to have people feel like they can be themselves, without feeling societies stigmas, so that was what I aimed for in this conference,” Arias said in an email.</span></p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 40 people marched with signs outside of the UCSB Library and the Arbor, chanting “UC, UC, you’re no good; treat your workers like you should.” The protest was held first between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and later from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s picket line was held to show “solidarity” with the union’s bargaining team as it works toward reaching an agreement on issues like UC overstaffing and emergency layoffs, according to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundskeeper lead Juan Donato has worked at UCSB for seven years and joined Thursday’s protest because it is “symbolic” of the 50th anniversary of the death of two sanitation workers, who were killed on the job after their truck’s compactor malfunctioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We deserve, we matter and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” he said. “[It’s] interesting for me 50 years of fighting and [we’re] still in the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident prompted a strike in Memphis, which drew approximately 1,300 workers, according to the AFSCME website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workers’ deaths “inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to join in marching against poor pay and unsafe working conditions,” UCSB Student Health Medical Assistant Babe Gonzales said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzales has worked at UCSB for 28 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is about equality, security, dignity and fairness with all UC workers. What we want is protection for women, immigrants and people of color,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the workers protesting today want wages that increase with inflation, affordable health care, secure retirement and an end to the outsourcing of jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hijinio Camacho, known around UCSB and Isla Vista as “The Elotero,” also worked at the protest by serving food alongside AFSCME workers to those who were picketing.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80758\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1038365017\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80759\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80758\" data-attachment-id=\"80758\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/union-workers-march-in-remembrance-hold-picket-line-for-workers-rights/2016x1134-jpeg-804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016×1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80758\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hijinio Camacho served food alongside AFSCME during the picket line. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made the decision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to hold fundraisers on UCSB’s campus because he cannot afford the high insurance costs required of campus vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We represent cooks, custodians, groundskeepers, so we’re right now trying to send a message to management saying that this is about equality, this is about fairness,” AFSCME organizer Mercedes Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want [the UC] to treat them right, and that’s why we have to do this,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Kile, a fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern, explained that he joined the protest today because of his father, who passed away from pancreatic cancer before Kile started his senior year of high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that his father worked two jobs, one at U.P.S. and one working full time at California Lutheran University.

Many of our workers are working through full-time jobs. If they end up with the same thing then there’s gonna be someone else like me who loses a parent,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has had to drop out of school and has “literally lost weight from not being able to eat.” He has also been homeless during parts of his time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kile said that over the past 40 years, unions have been in a “sharp decline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone from Democrats to Republicans have been attacking unions for a very, very long time,” he said. “I mean, Hillary Clinton was on the board of Walmart, which was one of the biggest union busters, Elon Musk is a union buster, Jeff Bezos from Amazon hates unions and the working conditions they produce are horrific.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also referenced the wage gap between men and women, explaining that the average pay from women to men is 78 cents an hour, but for Latinx women it is approximately 55 cents an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Where do you fix that, where do you fix those inequalities across race, gender, sexuality and everything?

President Hieu Le proposed a plan to renovate the UCen building, which could increase student fees by $20 per student per quarter. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCen/Student Union Renovation and Expansion project goal is to “address critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen,” according to the first draft of the resolution submitted to Senate.</p>\n<p>The first draft of the resolution was tabled indefinitely, and a new one was passed at the Jan. 31 Senate meeting, reaffirming support for Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>Senator Grecia Martinez authored and Senator Kian Maalizadeh seconded the first draft of the original resolution. Maalizadeh authored and Martinez seconded the Jan. 31 affidavit resolution.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes for it, and I want other students to believe in it,” Martinez said of Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Outreach Coordinator James Ferraro spoke against the first resolution during the public forum during Wednesday’s Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>Ferraro, who met with Le earlier, said Le had stated that the project would require a student fee increase that could reach as high as $300 a year beginning in five years. Until then, the project would require a $20 increase per student per quarter.</p>\n<p>“That’s a 48 million dollar project, as I mentioned, and I think it’s a lot to ask from students to pay for the majority of that cost,” Ferraro said. “A lot of students have a very tough financial burden, and every dollar really counts for them.”</p>\n<p>Le declined the <em>Nexus’</em> request for comment, but spoke to the Senate later and confirmed the potential costs of the new project for students.</p>\n<p>He said the project has a $48 million budget which would be funded through a combination of student fees and fundraising, and that the fees would range from $21 to $99 per quarter. The project, however, is still in its preliminary stages; Le will need to collect signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the 2018 A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>He said the plan would include an approximately $50 million return for students with financial aid to supplement the fee for students who could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p>Ferraro explained that the current proposal doesn’t include any financial commitment from the university aside from setting up a fundraiser that would solicit funds from alumni donors.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of you really opposed when the UC Regents or when [the] university is really trying to raise our fees and you guys really fight and you’re great leaders on that,” Ferraro said to the senators.</p>\n<p>“But I think when it comes to this and when it comes to internal funding, I think you really have to be careful and really pay attention to what they’re asking for, especially Office of the President,” he added.</p>\n<p>The original resolution references a 2012 space survey which states that “38% of A.S. entities has no assigned space, while a quarter of A.S. entities used temporary or shared spaces. A.S. is located in seven different buildings on campus making it difficult for students to collaborate and integrate their ideas, projects, and communications.”</p>\n<p>The resolution proposed the expansion and renovation of the UCen because it is nearly $2 million in debt and the majority of the businesses are not successful. It also states that the interior and exterior need to be remodeled for general aesthetics “in order to have a comparative advantage over other elite universities.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also references the UCSB Long Range Development Plan 2025, which calls for an annual one percent growth of students until UCSB reaches a capacity of 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>Le created a task force to revisit the Student Union Revitalization Fund (S.U.R.F.), which had been originally created by previous A.S. president Jonathan Abboud in 2013, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The S.U.R.F. proposal received approval from the Campus Planning Community, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fischer, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young, Chancellor Henry Yang and A.S. when it was first proposed in 2014.</p>\n<p>Le’s task force would assess the “internal needs” of A.S. and update the S.U.R.F. proposal. The updated plan provides 40 percent more program area than the previous concept and “[addresses] critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen.”</p>\n<p>Proposed spaces that would also be refined would include the A.S. Bike Shop, the A.S. Food Bank relocation and expansions, A.S. Senate Chambers, A.S. Recycling Center relocation, A.S. office improvements and an Environmental Sustainability Resource Center.</p>\n<p>The original resolution states that Senate stands in “full support” of Le’s project and described the project as “well-needed” and “long-overdue.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro was mistakenly named as a San Miguel Hall Council Member. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
