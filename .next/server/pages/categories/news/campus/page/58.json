Synthetic drugs mimic the effects of illegal substances and have slightly altered chemical structures, which tend to be more powerful and unpredictable than non-synthetic substances. They can cause excited delirium, anxiety and paranoia which can lead to violent aggression and self-injury. The risks of using these drugs include seizures, heart attacks and death.</p>\n<p>Alcohol and Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said users of synthetic drugs are looking for effects similar to LSD but have much more severe experiences.</p>\n<p>“The kind of trips students are expecting to take when they take LSD is not the kind of response they are getting from the substances,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Kurta said N-Bomb, Flakka and bath salts are the most common synthetic drugs students have reportedly been attaining.</p>\n<p>“These substances are not pure LSD, but they are chemically combined substances which result in unpredictable self-harm, unexpected psychotic unexplainable behavior,” Kurta said. “We know that it’s out there and that it’s very available.”</p>\n<p>According to Department of Psychological and Brain Studies professor Karen Szumlinski, bath salts are synthetic derivatives of cathinone, an active stimulant prohibited in some states and banned in some countries. Szumlinski said it blocks re-uptake of dopamine and serotonin, causing pleasurable effects, and blocks norepinephrine receptors, increasing the user’s heart rate.</p>\n<p>“Bath salts are a generic name for a composite of all sorts of different chemicals,” Szumlinski said. “With bath salts, because they’re more amphetamine-like, you will have more delusions of issues that are related to your illegal drug activity.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said the cathinone derivatives are also found in spice, Flakka and K-2 synthetic marijuana that can cause psychosis. According to Szumlinski, Flakka has the effects of hallucinogens and amphetamines and can cause aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>“Flakka blows my mind and is frightening,” Szumlinski said. “Flakka is LSD-like and actually activates the same receptors that LSD activates, the serotonin 2A receptors.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said N-Bomb is similar to LSD in that it also activates the serotonin 2A receptor that LSD activates, and it is not a safer alternative.</p>\n<p>“The effects are shorter than LSD,” Szumlinski said. “In terms of it being safer than LSD, the answer is not at all.”</p>\n<p>An anonymous first-year biochemistry major who is a repeat user of LSD and a one-time user of N-Bomb said while both drugs are euphoric, a LSD trip can be described as more of a “central experience” while N-Bomb is more of a “chaotic” party drug.</p>\n<p>“With N-Bomb you have more visual effects, and LSD has more mental and psychological effects,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The student said they chose to consume the synthetic drug out of curiosity, but did not have a positive experience.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have a good time with it, and I’d rather just stick with actual LSD,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The students also said for many users of N-Bomb, “you don’t know what you’re getting into.”</p>\n<p>“If you don’t know it’s N-Bomb, you can get a bad trip,” the student said. “It’s kind of like weed in a way, you laugh a lot, at random shit, and the visuals are much more than LSD.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Sergeant Daniel Calderon said synthetic drug use is “everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“It’s throughout California, it’s throughout the states, it’s a worldwide problem. There has been an increase in synthetic-type drug use, but that’s globally across the board, it’s not just in Isla Vista,” Calderon said. “I believe that people sometimes think it’s safer because they are synthetic and/or man-made.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP receives medical calls for synthetic drug users displaying erratic behavior or psychological episodes. According to Calderon, these subjects often “can’t comprehend logical thought” and do not want care from emergency response.</p>\n<p>“They’re in such a delusional state that they’ll actually try to fight against the medics,” Calderon said. “Any type of drug can be dangerous because you don’t know how your body is going to react.”</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Simon Trujillo said the use and possession of these drugs is not prohibited, but the sale to minors is illegal in some areas.</p>\n<p>“The main problem with them is there are many combinations, there’s many different chemical compositions … there is no uniform way to control how they are produced. Their effects are often unpredictable,” Trujillo said. “If a user were to use them multiple times they may get a different reaction or a different experience each time they use them.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said part of the appeal of synthetic drugs is that they are an alternative to traditional street drugs, and that they can be marketed and distributed in packaging similar to candy wrappers.</p>\n<p>Calderon said in medical emergencies involving drugs, it is best to seek help and notify the authorities of information that can aid responders in helping intoxicated persons.</p>\n<p>“They’re not going to get in trouble and it’s better to call,” Calderon said. “They’re protected by law against any prosecution in a medical emergency.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/","id":2607,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2606,2605,2604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Swimmer Speaks on Novel, Record-Breaking Journey","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nyad_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nyad_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Open-water swimmer and author Diana Nyad spoke and held a signing of her new novel, Find a Way, Saturday at a UCSB Arts & Lectures event in Campbell Hall.

Nyad unsuccessfully attempted the swim four times starting at age 28, with the 2013 swim being her fifth attempt in 35 years.</p>\n<p>Nyad said she thought of Cuba as “an untouchable star with a simply irresistible mystique” throughout her childhood, early swimming career and time as a professional sports journalist and commentator.</p>\n<p>Nyad said the most difficult part of her swim to Havana was nighttime, when she experienced “total sensory deprivation.”</p>\n<p>“That second night I had no idea who I was or what I was doing.” Nyad said. “I thought the blackness would never end.”</p>\n<p>Nyad said accomplishments should be viewed in terms of personal development.</p>\n<p>“When you achieve your dreams, it’s not so much about what you get but the person you become,” Nyad said. “I don’t succeed at everything I do, but I’m living this wild and precious life of mine full throttle.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Kristina Hill, who just completed an open-water swim from the Channel Islands to Oxnard, attended Nyad’s talk Saturday. Hill said she admires Nyad and was excited to learn she would be in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m just beginning to fall in love with this sport, and the fact that such an athletic and personal icon is here now in Santa Barbara is just awe-inspiring,” Hill said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Julie Keller said the talk was “extremely motivating,” but people do not necessarily need to set goals of the same scale as Nyad’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to note that these methods of extreme accomplishments and larger-than-life goal setting are certainly not for everyone,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>Lisa Noack, a parent of a UCSB student, said she read Nyad’s book and appreciates the idea of valuing one’s journey over the final destination.</p>\n<p>“We’re trained to get to the next level at every stage of our life and think that reaching that certain level will make us happy,” Noack said. “While brief moments of accomplishment are sweet, we forget about the deep value within the difficult, long process of accomplishing our goals. Diana truly relishes in the significance of her work while achieving what she wants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/","id":2613,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2612,2611,2610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Autopsy Results Released in Death of UCSB Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office released new information Monday about the death of 19-year-old, second-year UCSB student Andres Sanchez in Isla Vista on Oct. 11.

The most common method of ingesting 25I-NBOMe is orally. The most prevalent street names for this drug are ‘25I’ or ‘N-Bomb.’ Although 25I-NBOMe has been around for more than 12 years, recreational abuse rates for the drug have increased dramatically in the past few years, resulting in a significant number of hospitalizations for overdoses, as well as deaths. Ingestion of 25I-NBOMe can result in seizures, aggression, self-harm and agitation, distortions in space and time, psychosis-like symptoms, an abnormally rapid heart rate, increased body temperature, and rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. Existing case reports of 25I-NBOMe abuse indicates that there is a substantial risk of toxicity after ingesting limited quantities of this hallucinogenic substance. Ketamine is an anesthetic, with hallucinogenic properties. Common street names for ketamine, include ‘K’ and ‘Vitamin K,’ among many others. Although it was developed in the early 1960’s as an anesthetic, its popularity as a recreational hallucinogenic drug has increased dramatically in the past ten years as result of its association with “rave” dances. Misuse of ketamine can result in hallucinations, delirium, irrational behavior and progress into cardiovascular and respiratory irregularities.</em></p>\n<p>Sanchez was also under the influence of marijuana at the time of his death, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>Read the full press release below:</p>\n<p style=\" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;

Punjabi Studies Pashaura Singh presented the history of Sikhism through its social and religious evolution at the MultiCultural Center Wednesday as the first speaker of its Religious Literacy series.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the MCC will be hosting the series to educate students on the basics of new faiths and perspectives.</p>\n<p>“The religious literary experience at UCSB’s MCC started as a result of some lock-in fees that we acquired, and now it’s this big thing,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s very important in our programming every quarter to include the ‘AB’s of a faith or work on religious events to expand horizons rooted in issues that might come out of them that our students might feel connected to.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the series began with a lecture on Sikhism to break down negative stereotypes of the religion.</p>\n<p>“It was important for a lot of reasons … to kind of shatter stereotypes and misconceptions of the Sikh community in conjunction with the Muslim community in the United States, where there’s such a heightened Islamophobia targeted at Muslims and people who look like they’re Muslims,” Mohsenian- Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Singh began his talk by explaining the core values taught by the religion’s founder, Guru Nanak, who was described by Singh as “looking at the audience, always ready to have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Singh said one of the most notable things Guru Nanak established is the concept of a free canteen within a Sikh religious building called a Langar.</p>\n<p>“It is a very powerful institution he created — when you share the food, your ideas … the dining place expands the ideas,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh said Sikhism is evolving and effectively entering the mainstream.</p>\n<p>“Social media is revolutionary; all communities are changing. It’s not just the Sikhi,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Jagdeep Kaur said he was taught the principles of Sikhism by his family.</p>\n<p>“Growing up, my parents taught me a lot of stuff about Sikhism. When I was younger I would go to Sunday school, and they would teach us a lot about Sikhism and the culture,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Singh said many people, especially youth, find a connection to Sikhism because it teaches that “all human beings are equal.” Second-year communication and history of public policy double-major Jashleen Singh said she enjoys this aspect of Sikhism most.</p>\n<p>“He was talking about Langar and how everyone can go into the temple during lunch. Everyone eats together — it doesn’t matter whether you’re homeless,” Jashleen Singh said. “You don’t have to be Indian; you can be any other race and still come in. It’s a very accepting environment and a very accepting religion to have grown up with.”</p>\n<p>Attendee Emma Bobro said she came to the event to try to find a faith system she could believe in and discovered how fascinating Sikhism can be.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful, well, because it’s so basic. It seems more universal,” Bobro said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Movement began on the steps of UC Berkeley’s Sproul Hall in 1964 when thousands of student activists insisted the University of California lift its ban on campus political activities and acknowledge students’ First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>Among the student activists was artist and former UC Berkeley student David Goines, whose participation in the student protest led to his expulsion from the university and 60-day jail sentence.</p>\n<p>“When you’re 19 years old, that’s a long time,” Goines said.</p>\n<p>For Goines, the unrestricted expression of a student’s speech is something he and other Free Speech Movement activists had to “wrestle” away from UC with “fire and blood” in the 1960s. Now, over 50 years later, the issue of whether or not the UC can regulate student speech has come into question once again — this time, with the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>Several accounts of anti-Semitism have taken place on UC campuses over the last year. In January, students at a UC Davis-affiliated Jewish fraternity found swastikas spray-painted on their building in January, and in February, student government leaders at UCLA questioned the eligibility of a student for a campus judicial panel because of her involvement in Jewish organizations.</p>\n<p>In light of these events, over the summer the UC Board of Regents began crafting a statement which outlines their principles against “intolerant” acts such as threats, harassment, hate speech and derogatory language. After failing to draft a statement that satisfied all parties, the Regents called together a working group to form a policy that more adequately addresses anti-Semitism on university campuses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>These rights that I fought for — you want to give them away. You just want to hand them over. You don’t even want to put up a fight. Well, I think that’s disgusting.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goines, hearkening back to his days in the Free Speech Movement, argues students should not allow the UC to create any sort of policy regulating the content of their speech. This, he says, is surrendering the rights which he and his fellow activists fought for decades ago.</p>\n<p>“These rights that I fought for — you want to give them away. You just want to hand them over. You don’t even want to put up a fight,” Goines said. “Well, I think that’s disgusting.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel executive director Rabbi Evan Goodman said free speech is not “unlimited” and the Regents need to instate a policy that protects Jewish students from anti-Semitic “hate speech.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, a line should be drawn — an argument he presented to the Regents at the working group’s forum in October at UCLA. Rabbi Goodman spoke and advocated for the Regents to adopt a policy on anti-Semitism similar to that of the United States Department of State, which states that denying Israel’s right to exist is an action considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>In a radio interview with 90.9 WBUR last May, UC President Janet Napolitano also said she personally advocates for the State Department definition of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“I have my own personal view, and my personal view is that we should [adopt the State Department’s definition],” Napolitano said in the interview.</p>\n<p>The State Department gives several criteria — known as the Three Ds — of the ways in which anti-Semitism “manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel.” The Three Ds include: demonizing Israel, applying a double standard to Israel and delegitimizing Israel. Within these criteria under the state definition, comparing Israeli policies to Nazi Germany, focusing on Israel solely for human rights investigations and denying the right of Israel’s existence are examples of actions that would be considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>In his speech to the Regents at the UCLA forum, Goodman recommended the Regents protect Jewish students from hate speech with a policy that categorizes denying Israel’s right to exist as anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“I urge the Regents to adopt a clear, system-wide definition of anti-Semitism, including some versions of the Three Ds, with explicit policies and procedures that protect Jewish students in the UC system from experiencing a hostile environment,” Goodman said in his speech.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Accusations are made that Jews as a people are responsible for things. For example, last year posters appeared on campus that had a Jewish star and it said that Jews are responsible for 9/11.<br>\n<em>– Rabbi Evan Goodman</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goodman, in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>, said in the past seven years working in Isla Vista he has seen a rise in more “subtle” anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic activities on UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>“Extreme examples are swastikas on a Jewish person’s possessions or their home or Jewish fraternity,” Goodman said. “Accusations are made that Jews as a people are responsible for things. For example, last year posters appeared on campus that had a Jewish star and it said that Jews are responsible for 9/11.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, the UC needs to adopt an intolerance policy like that of the State Department to adequately acknowledge the “key role” the state of Israel plays in Jewish identity.</p>\n<p>“To me, the State Department definition is not the be-all and end-all,” Goodman said. “It’s a good starting point to recognize that for the preponderance of Jewish students, connection with Israel plays a key role in their own personal, religious and cultural identity.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she is also in support of the State Department definition to prevent religious intolerance on campus and to protect Jewish students from discrimination.</p>\n<p>“No matter how you feel about Israel, if you value protection of all students on campus and the safety of those students on campus, then you’d value the methods in which those students tell you they feel most safe … the definition under which those students will tell you they feel most safe, not your interpretation of what that definition could mean,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<h2><strong>What About the First Amendment?</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the fundamental questions surrounding the debate to create a policy for anti-Semitism in the UC system is whether or not such a regulation would infringe on the First Amendment. There are many like Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (F.I.R.E.) attorney Will Creeley, who finds these “calls for censorship” to be worrisome in respect to free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“This is a dispute that is bitter; it is intensely felt by both sides, and I think that has resulted in calls for censorship by both sides,” Creeley said. “I’m really worried because no matter how well intentioned those matters are, they still amount to a plea for official government intervention in response to what is core speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Their stated intent is to choke speech and they’re very open about that.<br>\n<em>– Attorney Liz Jackson</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Attorney Liz Jackson from Palestine Legal, an independent organization dedicated to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of people who speak out for Palestinian freedom, also views the adoption of the State Department definition of anti-Semitism as censorship of protected speech. Jackson said those who promote such a definition are purposely trying to suspend free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“They say it’s just a standard for what is considered anti-Semitic and what is not, but that is completely disingenuous and goes against the demonstrated record of attacks to censor speech on campus,” Jackson said. “Their stated intent is to choke speech and they’re very open about that.”</p>\n<p>Goines also said any attempt to regulate the content of speech is contrary to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“If there are college students who are demanding that the government stop somebody from saying something, they simply have not read the First Amendment and do not understand it,” Goines said.</p>\n<p>However, according to Rabbi Goodman, free speech has limitations.</p>\n<p>“It should be protected and it has to be protected, but there are limits and we recognize those limits in all sorts of other areas of our lives, particularly when there’s hostility to minority groups,” Goodman said. “The Jews should be afforded the same kind of protections that those other minority groups get.”</p>\n<p>Elyasi said she does not think the UC adopting the State Department definition will violate anyone’s First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>“On a federal level everyone is entitled to whatever they want to say for anyone about anything. That is what free speech is,” Elyasi said. “You wouldn’t go into a LGBTQ+ meeting shouting homophobic slurs. Jewish students want the same protection because anti-Semitism is on the rise.”</p>\n<p>Creeley noted the United States does not have an official ban on hate speech, as much of it is protected under the First Amendment and hate speech itself is difficult to define.</p>\n<p>“It’s such an amorphous concept. One person’s hate speech is another person’s freedom manifesto,” Creeley said. “It really depends on the eye of the beholder and the ear of the beholder. It is difficult to say what can and cannot be said based on the listener’s reaction.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want the government to start regulating the content of speech, welcome to fucking Nazi Germany.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goines said the First Amendment was created to protect not only the speech people want to hear, but that which they disagree with.</p>\n<p>“If you want the government to start regulating the content of speech, welcome to fucking Nazi Germany,” Goines said.</p>\n<h2><strong>When Does Free Speech Go Too Far?</strong></h2>\n<p>Controversy surrounds the State Department definition’s proviso on anti-Semitism. Individuals have questioned whether there exists a clear line between criticizing Israel and being anti-Semitic when referencing the Jewish nation state.</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, there is a definitive line between speech that is simply criticizing Israel and speech that is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“To be critical of Israel is certainly fine,” Goodman said. “To deny the right of the Jewish people to have the same kind of national rights that any other people have is anti-Semitic.”</p>\n<p>Past Santa Barbara Hillel student president and fourth-year anthropology and global studies double-major Sarah Tagger said the line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism should be drawn where people begin to deny the necessity of Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“It is fair to discuss Israel’s politics as you would any other country,” Tagger said in an email. “However, when the discussion shifts from possible critiques on Israel’s policies to that of its existence that crosses a line.”</p>\n<p>However, opponents of the definition argue there is no clear line and what they express as constructive criticism of Israel is considered anti-Semitic hate speech by others. Eugene Volokh, who teaches at the UCLA School of Law and has recently covered the Missouri University protests for the Washington Post, said there is no clear definition of anti-Semitism and people will always question whether the criticism of Israel is similar to that leveled against any other country.</p>\n<p>“The overall State Department definition puts people who harshly criticize Israel in a position where they are basically presumed to be anti-Semitic unless their motives are somehow shown to be pure by a comparison of the criticism of Israel with that leveled at other countries,” Volokh said in an email. “But any such comparisons are almost always subjective and highly contestable.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>To be critical of Israel is certainly fine. To deny the right of the Jewish people to have the same kind of national rights that any other people have is anti-Semitic.<br>\n<em>– Rabbi Evan Goodman</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Volokh, people’s criticisms of different countries will vary since the situations each country faces are different.</p>\n<p>“The critics might think that some kinds of criticisms are more effective at changing the behavior of one country than another, or just because many people understandably focus their energies on one conflict rather than trying to learn about and talk about many different conflicts,” Volokh said in an email.</p>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) representative and third-year music studies major Daniel Mogtaderi said there is “danger” in labeling certain criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“What’s really dangerous about calling the criticism of Israel anti-Semitic is what they’re saying to Jewish students is that any criticism of Israel is criticism of all Jewish people,” Mogtaderi said.</p>\n<p>Mogtaderi said people should feel free to safely criticize Israel and other countries without fear of censorship.</p>\n<p>“To try to limit that by calling it racist, which is basically what anti-Semitism is, is a disservice,” Mogtaderi said. “We should have that space on campus to talk about countries that we don’t agree with the policies of.”</p>\n<h2><strong>The Consequences of Speaking Out?</strong></h2>\n<p>During the UC Board of Regents meeting on Oct. 16, Regent Richard C. Blum stated he and his wife, Democratic California Senator Diane Feinstein, advocate for the UC to adopt a statement on anti-Semitic hate speech and create a set of penalties regulating such speech. According to Blum, Feinstein will publically engage to be “critical” of the UC system if the Regents do not “do the right thing.”</p>\n<p>“Students doing the things that have been cited here today probably should have either a dismissal or suspension from school,” Blum said at the meeting. “I don’t know how many of you feel so strongly that way, but my wife does and I do, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, Palestine Legal responded to nearly 300 incidents of alleged accusations of anti-Semitism this year alone, with 85 percent of those incidents targeting students and scholars on over 65 different campuses across the country.</p>\n<p>“Over one third occurred in California. Of the nearly 300 incidents we responded to, 159 involved false accusations of anti-Semitism based solely on speech critical of the Israeli government,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Creeley said enacting the official State Department definition of anti-Semitism would create a “slippery slope” among other minority groups creating their own specialized definition of discrimination against them.</p>\n<p>“If you pass the principles of intolerance and allow students to report other people, then pretty quickly people who are on the pro-Palestinian side of things will report the Jewish students for speech they find hateful against Palestinians,” Creeley said. “Then those Jewish students will be investigated under those same measures that were intended to help them and vice-versa.”</p>\n<p>According to Volokh, adopting the State Department definition will limit academic discussion through microaggressions, subtle but offensive comments or actions directed at a minority or other non-dominant group that often unintentionally or unconsciously reinforce a stereotype.</p>\n<p>“Labeling speech ‘anti-Semitic’ sends a powerful message to faculty members and students, especially ones who weren’t protected under tenure — a message that you had better not express certain views if you want to stay on the administration’s good side,” Volokh said in an email. “That’s a serious blow to academic freedom and to freedom of discourse more generally.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you pass the principles of intolerance and allow students to report other people, then pretty quickly people who are on the pro-Palestinian side of things will report the Jewish students for speech they find hateful against Palestinians.<br>\n<em>– F.I.R.E. attorney Will Creeley</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Creeley, principles against intolerance will encourage students and faculty to report one another to the authorities for “policing” opinions they disagree with.</p>\n<p>“That’s the wrong lesson to teach students and faculty about life in our democracy,” Creeley said. “The answer to speech we don’t like is more speech, not punishment. The better response is to allow a great deal of political speech, which allows truth to arise.”</p>\n<p>Goines said giving the government the ability to regulate free speech, regardless of what topic that speech addresses, is a surrender of one’s valuable free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“The content of speech is not important — it doesn’t matter. It takes power to regulate it, and if you voluntarily give that up because I’m saying something you don’t like, you have given away a very precious right for a small gain.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Who Can Define Hate Speech?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to UCSB religious studies professor Richard Hecht, defining anti-Semitism is the responsibility of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask an African American person in the 1960s as to what constitutes racism, they would reject the possibility that the white person has the ability to say, ‘this is racist’ or ‘this is not racist,’” Hecht said. “Ultimately you have to take very seriously the object of hate, which is, in this case, Jews.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Tagger also said only Jewish students should define the parameters of anti-Semitism at the university.</p>\n<p>“We are continuously shut down and told what is and what is not anti-Semitic. How can everyone else define that for us?” Tagger said in an email. “If we feel that these comments and demonstrations of ‘free speech’ cross boundaries, then we should be heard.”</p>\n<p>UC Student Regent Avi Oved also said it is inappropriate for individuals outside of the Jewish community to define what anti-Semitism is and to dictate how the Jewish community should feel about anti-Semitic activity.</p>\n<p>“We must respect the fact that we can only speak to our own experiences, identities, and respective communities and use this opportunity as a platform for education,” Oved said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Hecht, Israel is closely tied to the religious identity of Jews for various historical reasons.</p>\n<p>“What has happened in the twentieth century is that Israel has become the central component of Jewish life,” Hecht said. “Israel is integrated into Jewish identity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB SJP member Mogtaderi said Israel is not inherently related to Jewish religious identity and thus speech against the policies of Israel as a political entity cannot be considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What has happened in the twentieth century is that Israel has become the central component of Jewish life. Israel is integrated into Jewish identity.<br>\n<em>– UCSB religious studies professor Richard Hecht</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>“Anti-Semitism is something that is against Jewish people for being Jewish. It has nothing to do with the state of Israel,” Mogtaderi said. “We’re criticizing a nation’s policies, not a religion that holds its people’s identity.”</p>\n<p>Palestine Legal attorney Jackson said the term “Israeli” should not be conflated with the word “Jewish,” since approximately 25 percent of Israelis are not Jewish.</p>\n<p>“The state of Israel does not represent all Jews in the world. It does not represent me. I’m Jewish. It is not my homeland and the majority of the global Jewish population does not live in Israel,” Jackson said. “It’s not a Jewish place.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Is This About Divestment?</strong></h2>\n<p>Jackson said the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement would be considered anti-Semitic under the State Department definition. According to Jackson, advocates are pushing for this definition to purposely undermine the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>“That would have a chilling affect against First Amendment speech,” Jackson said. “There would be many people afraid to engage in the issue at all and that’s the reason why the promoters are trying to adopt it. It’s very obvious.”</p>\n<p>F.I.R.E. Free Speech attorney Creeley said regardless of one’s position on the issue of divestment, the movement is protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“Would the opponents of the divestment movement characterize them as anti-Semitic? Absolutely — I think that would be an almost inevitable result,” Creeley said.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB religious professor Hecht said the activists behind the BDS movement are driven by anti-Semitism and have no interest in providing “legitimate criticism” for the state of Israel.</p>\n<p>“Legitimate criticisms should be made about Israel’s social life and political life and economic life,” Hecht said. “The people who sponsor the BDS movement are not interested in criticism.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The First Amendment is not there to protect the government from you. The First Amendment is there to protect you from the government.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) member and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double- major Marjan Kris said he believes Israel-aligned activists who label the BDS movement as anti-Semitic are “pulling a card.”</p>\n<p>“If it’s something they don’t like hearing, they’ll say, ‘Oh that’s anti-Semitic,’” Kris said.</p>\n<p>Kris said adopting the State Department definition of anti-Semitism is a violation of the First Amendment and an attempt to block divestment from Israel.</p>\n<p>“How can we move on and progress with limitations that seem to literally render us voiceless?” Kris said. “Speech translates into action. By limiting our free speech, you’re limiting our action. By limiting our action, you’re limiting our movement.”</p>\n<p>At the upcoming UC Board of Regents on Nov. 18 at UC San Francisco, the Regents will further discuss the stance they want to take on the issue of designating certain speech as anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>Former UC Berkeley student Goines argues that all advocates on the issue need to be well-versed on the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“The First Amendment is not there to protect the government from you,” Goines said. “The First Amendment is there to protect you from the government.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/","id":2610,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2609,2608,2607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Active Minds of UCSB To Attend Health Conference","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Active-Minds-Irvine_Courtesy-of-Wikipedia-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Active-Minds-Irvine_Courtesy-of-Wikipedia-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s Active Minds chapter will attend the Active Minds 12th National Mental Health on Campus Conference at UC Irvine this weekend to network with chapters from across the nation.

The conference will allow members to interact with mental health experts, activists and leaders.</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds Co-President and fourth-year psychology major Melissa Boomer said this will be the first time in years that the UCSB chapter can attend the conference, because it is the first time the conference will be on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>“Active Minds National has been traditionally based on the East Coast,” Boomer said. “It was just really far away and really difficult to get funding for [the] long flight — things like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Boomer, the conferences are aimed at bringing Active Minds chapters together from around the country to share ideas the can help people struggling with mental health issues and combat the stigma surrounding mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“We have the ability to seriously create really useful ideas and things that we can do to help our goals together,” Boomer said. “We get a lot of help with leadership and ideas for advocacy — ideas for getting funding since we’re a nonprofit — things like that.”</p>\n<p>Boomer said the “shining stars” of the chapters across the country will lead workshops, which the UCSB chapter will attend.</p>\n<p>“What we get from the conferences is being able to see exemplary work being done by campuses and being able to be taught by them — you know, this is what we’re doing right, so you can get all of the pieces … these [are] all really great ideas. How can we incorporate that into what we’re doing on our campus?” Boomer said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds Social Media Officer and third-year biopsychology major Crystal Groel said she looks forward to attending the workshops and meeting members of other chapters.</p>\n<p>“There are definitely things that are going to educate people on how to deal with mental illness and how to help those that are going through mental health problems,” Groel said. “It’ll be a good education for me and other people, and just being involved with a community of people who want to get the same thing you do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds event coordinator and third-year biopsychology major Joren Adams said the Associated Students Finance and Business Committee provided funding for UCSB Active Minds to attend conference, but not every member can attend.</p>\n<p>“We basically were able to take, per finance board stipulation, nine officers and three general members, but I think that only one general member is going,” Adams said.</p>\n<p>Adams said he is looking forward to meeting students doing similar work at their institutions.<br>\n“I just think there is going to be, again, the ability to learn from other people, because we’ve isolated ourselves on campus,” Adams said. “We’re, like, kind of the only real groups that talk about mental health on our campus, so it’d be nice to meet with other groups that talk about mental health on their campus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds member and second-year global studies major Kaylee Peterson said she joined Active Minds earlier this year after seeing the Send Silence Packing display on campus, which featured backpacks representing lives of college students lost to suicide.</p>\n<p>“I got involved with Active Minds because I think mental health is a really important issue on campus, and as well just in general in our society,” Peterson said. “I really want to learn the tools to talk about mental health and erase the stigma in our society, as well as make it a more open topic.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 12 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

through UC Santa Barbara’s campus on Thursday, joining more than 100 campuses nationwide in the Million Student March, a movement demanding free tuition, the elimination of student debt and a $15 minimum wage.</p>\n<p>The march was the largest protest on UCSB’s campus in recent memory and stoked the embers of other activist movements: many students wore black to show solidarity with University of Missouri protesters, sported Bernie Sanders pins or held up Black Lives Matter signs. Approximately a dozen organizers labored to direct the larger-than-expected crowd as they marched from Storke Tower to Cheadle Hall and back while documenting the march on social media.

Yang said he supports students and sees the need for a “vital dialogue” on how to make public higher education accessible.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to send a strong message to our elected officials about the value of the University of California and the need to keep higher education accessible and affordable to all Californians,” Yang said in the statement.</p>\n<p>A.S. vice president for statewide affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said organizers were nervous about how many people would attend the protest until hundreds of students arrived on the steps of Storke Tower at noon.</p>\n<p>“We were all nervous about how many students we could get to turn out to make this statement,” Mirza said. “It was all about making the loudest statement possible that we, as a generation, agree with these three demands.”</p>\n<p>Once a few hundred students gathered, organizers led the march across campus as administrators and students looked on. Protesters implored students to “walk out” of classes, and by the time the crowd reached Campbell Hall, more than a thousand students had joined the march.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66445\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"453475648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66445\" data-attachment-id=\"66445\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/more-than-1000-march-for-free-tuition-living-wage/million-student-march-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447334061\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"75\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Million Student March-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66445\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Mirza, who helped organize the event, said the march showcases UCSB’s activist culture.</p>\n<p>“We talk about UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz as being these places with strong activist spirits, but I think we proved today … that [UCSB is] every bit a part of that legacy of student activism,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Education Ph.D. candidate Kathy Swift said the march was reminiscent of previous movements on other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“There’s been some really big student protests at other campuses, and it seems to me like UCSB has been pretty small to negligible,” Swift said. “This is the first time I saw such a massive outpouring of protest from UCSB students concerning tuition and education.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she felt she was the “most senior” person in the march, and wished that more faculty members had attended.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s incumbent upon the professors and the adjuncts and the educators here to come show support with students,” Swift said. “If I’m going to really put my money where my mouth is and be a true educator and teacher, I have to support students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m carrying massive amounts of debt right now and, in fact, I get no support from my department.

I’m in a position where I have to think about other people’s futures as well and determine how much I can invest in mine.”</p>\n<p>The march demonstrated a re-emergence of student mobilization that has historically driven fundamental change in society, according to Jones.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the stark realities of being priced out of higher education or being saddled with five or six-figure debt is enough to motivate more people to say ‘this is not right’ and to do something about it,” Jones said.</p>\n<p><em>Assistant News Editor Juliet Bachtel and Reporter Olivia Pla contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/vaMl4Pk3aZc</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

There are many people that can do it for you.”</p>\n<p>Rios said when he was younger, he stood on corners with his arms wide open in despair, hoping to be shot in a drive-by.</p>\n<p>“It was a chance encounter when my best friend was killed that led me to want to change,” Rios said. “I didn’t want to go to prison. I didn’t want to end up dead. People we might consider lost souls are like oysters, they are only going to open up when they are ready to change.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he felt disbelief upon being admitted to California State University East Bay, on academic probationary status and with a 1.9 grade point average, describing the occurrence as a “second chance.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important to speak truth and power, but it’s also important to speak truth to people,” Rios said. “Those college students spoke truth to me, and that is why I am here today … The social justice work that you do is a matter of life or death and I am just one example of this.”</p>\n<p>Rios encouraged the audience to consider applying to graduate school, which he said had opened doors for him.</p>\n<p>“Find your purpose and do something with your education that can open up doors for advocating for what you believe in,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Third-year black studies and sociology double major Janet Lopez said she took Rios’ course on juvenile justice this past summer.</p>\n<p>“Rios is really down to earth and relatable since he is from the inner cities of Oakland,” Lopez said. “He has been through a lot in his life and he is a really genuine teacher. His life story and the way he interacts with his students is one of the main reasons why I really wanted to come to this talk tonight.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Stephanie Periban said Rios inspired her to act on issues affecting Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Rios is also a true inspiration for the Latino community. Anyone that could overcome the adversities Rios has faced and become the success story and inspiration he is today deserves a standing ovation,” Periban said.<br>\nThird-year sociology major Yessica Becerra said she enjoyed the event and hopes to take a course with Rios before graduating.</p>\n<p>“When I saw this event on Facebook, I got really excited and cleared my schedule,” Becerra said. “I’m really glad I’m here and get to experience him as a lecturer, and hope that in my last five quarters I have the opportunity to take a course with him.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures.</p>\n<p>Nyad will share how she completed the 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida, the first person to do so without a protective shark cage. Nyad first attempted the feat at 28, but completed it in 2013 at the age of 64. Nyad is currently an author, public speaker and sports broadcaster who encourages people to pursue their dreams regardless of their age. Nyad’s TED Talk titled “Never, Ever Give Up” has more than three million views.</p>\n<p>UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures Program Manager Heather Silva said Nyad’s work as an athlete, as well as her being a member of the LGBTQ community, fits the UCSB “mantra.”</p>\n<p>“She has a profound appreciation for the outdoors, and is athletic and inspirational to all,” Silva said. “As a queer woman, she also represents the diversity we strive for at Arts &amp; Lectures at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Silva said the university has been considering hosting Nyad for years.<br>\n“After her big swim, we knew she would be a great fit for an event at UCSB,” Silva said.</p>\n<p>UCSB head swimming coach Greg Wilson said Nyad has pushed human limits as a swimmer.</p>\n<p>“In my 40 years I’ve trained a number of incredible long distance people. Not quite like Diana; she’s [swam] between countries,” Wilson said. “I’ve never met her but I have a built-in appreciation and wonder for what allows her to do these extraordinary things to the brink of human ability.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Nyad’s commitment to perfection is essential to her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“I endorse and completely subscribe to Diana’s philosophy of putting 100 percent into life in and out of the water,” Wilson said. “In anything a student or student athlete does, you need passion and full engagement to overcome adversity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Marine Science Institute Director and project scientist Andrew Brooks said ocean wild life was the biggest threat to Nyad’s undertaking.</p>\n<p>“While the media plays up the shark issue, the most dangerous threat she faced were the jellyfish, and the Australian box jelly can easily be fatal,” Brooks said. “Dehydration from saltwater or simple sunburn, cramping and lack of energy would be things I automatically worry about.”<br>\nBrooks said Nyad’s long-distance swim between countries is “staggering.”</p>\n<p>“She accomplished something amazing and was able to push the limits of the human body,” Brooks said. “I think it certainly speaks to her mental ability and strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year physical geography major Jack Sargent said that as someone who regularly surfs the California coast he appreciates Nyad’s ability to brave the elements to accomplish her goal.</p>\n<p>“Knowing the unending monotony of the ocean, I just cannot imagine that mental strain and physical strength required for over two days in the Florida straits,” Sargent said. “I’m really looking forward to hearing Diana’s story.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily

id=\"caption-attachment-66304\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Accessible, Attainable, Affordable Coalition UCSB (AAAC) will host #MillionStudentMarch Thursday beginning at Storke Tower to demand tuition-free public colleges, the cancellation of all student debt and a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>The march, which will begin at noon, is part of a nationwide movement including all UC campuses and over 90 other colleges and universities. AAAC is organizing the event with the United States Student Association, the Associated Students (A.S.) Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), the A.S. Office of the Student Advocate and UCSB-4-Bernie.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said the UC Board of Regents treats the University as more of a corporate entity than an academic institution, beginning when Ronald Reagan became governor of California.</p>\n<p>“Reagan ushered in an era of neoliberal thinking in California while he was governor,” Butts said. “That coupled with 17 Regents being business men who serve 12 year terms and only one student Regent, it is pretty clear that the UC is a business now to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the march will partially address how the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, which reaffirmed California’s prior commitment to the principle of tuition-free education, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p>“This is evident in when Governor Schwarzenegger and the UC Regents met in 2004 for the Compact for Higher Education,” Butts said. “There they made clear that students and donations would be the primary sources of funding instead of state funding.”</p>\n<p>Butts said tuition-free college is attainable.</p>\n<p>“If we decide that it is time for our school to return to a true public university, we can make it happen,” Butts said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference.<br>\n–<em> Josephine Ampaw</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Event organizer and third-year political science and feminist studies double major Josephine Ampaw said she hopes the Teach In AAAC hosted last week succeeded in educating students on tuition and debt and inspired attendees to affect change.</p>\n<p>“I hope this course of action will first off be taken seriously by our city, state and national leaders, who will execute a plan in order to make free higher education a reality after bringing the demands to the center stage,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Ampaw, accessible higher education is an investment in the future of the country.</p>\n<p>“I believe students have to fight for free tuition because education is a right, not a privilege,” Ampaw said. “Every person who lives in the state of California, in the United States and across the globe deserves the right to not only a elementary and secondary education, but to a higher education as well.”</p>\n<p>Ampaw said California has had tuition-free public higher education in the past.</p>\n<p>“Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the demand for a $15 minimum wage for all UC workers aims to facilitate the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole class of people who aren’t given the same opportunity as middle and upper middle-status people. With expensive public education and a $9 minimum wage, they as a collective are not able to overcome poor conditions with hard work,” Butts said. “Instead, the Million Student March is trying to level the playing field and create accessible forms of social mobility.”</p>\n<p>Butts said UCSB is a hub for student political engagement.</p>\n<p>“Looking at the history of UCSB and the UC system as a whole, I think we’re the heart of the student movement,” Butts said. “By hosting the march here at UCSB, we’re simply entering the long history we’ve had in activism.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Hannah Houska said the “the fight is now” against tuition hikes, because UC’s tuition freeze will end at the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is not to continue the cycle of tuition hike and tuition freeze, but rather our goal is to lower tuition,” Houska said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, #MillionStudentMarch will encourage students to be more politically active.</p>\n<p>“Come Thursday, it will be clear that frustration will bring students out,” Butts said. “It would be so easy to not come, but a million students across this country are going to have this issue be talked about, so activism is alive and well here at UCSB.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66318\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/million-students-march-movement-to-demand-tuition-free-public-college-no-student-debt-15-minimum-wage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66318\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/million-students-march-movement-to-demand-tuition-free-public-college-no-student-debt-15-minimum-wage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/million-students-march-movement-to-demand-tuition-free-public-college-no-student-debt-15-minimum-wage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/million-students-march-movement-to-demand-tuition-free-public-college-no-student-debt-15-minimum-wage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/million-students-march-movement-to-demand-tuition-free-public-college-no-student-debt-15-minimum-wage/","id":2693,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2692,2691,2690],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B met in the State Street room of the UCen on campus to consider $16,851 in requests from campus clubs. The committee fully funded requests from the Mock Trial Team for $1,495, Cotillion Dance Club for $3,950 and La Escuelita for $900. A.S. F&amp;B also partially funded requests from three clubs, allocating $2,370 to the Swing and Ballroom Dance Club, $3,000 to the Women’s Soccer Club and $850 to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the committee operated with $19,500 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665 in Senate Unallocated funds, $45,000 Student Initiated Outreach Program funds, $28,565 in Culture Weeks and Graduations funds, $26,480 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams.</p>\n<p>The Swing and Ballroom Dance Club requested $3,006 to host their “Swingin’ Hearts Swing Dance” event on Feb. 13, and was granted $2,370 by the committee and told to request funding for parking passes and photo booths from After Dark, a club that funds student-run, alcohol-free events.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major and Swing and Ballroom Dance Club representative Cecilia Gutierrez said the club provides a fun and educational experience for all skill-levels.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to providing social events for dancing. We encourage dancers from all backgrounds to participate and create a community,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Women’s Club Soccer requested $6,000 to fund travel and coaching expenses for nationals in Arizona, and was granted $3,000, the maximum funding amount allowed for sports clubs.</p>\n<p>The Mock Trial Team requested and was awarded $1,495 for travel expenses and registration fees for competitions in Arizona, Fresno and San Diego.</p>\n<p>Mock Trial member and third-year undeclared major James McFeely said members of the club compete in events that simulate courts of law.</p>\n<p>“We like to see Mock Trial as an academic sport,” McFeely said. “We’re asking for money to bring as many teams and as many people to as many tournaments we can so we can teach them the best we can.”</p>\n<p>CSSA was awarded $850 of their $1,500 request for hosting a Casino Night with live student performers.</p>\n<p>CSSA representative and second-year economics major Peilin Hu said the event allows audience members to enjoy free music and mingle.</p>\n<p>“The event aims to provide a relaxed music environment where like-minded people can perform and the audience can enjoy music,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club requested and was awarded $3,950 to host a weekly dance event in the Hub, where students will receive free dance lessons and socialize with other dancers.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita requested and was awarded $900 to host its annual Thanksgiving dinner with Hermanos Unidos for Isla Vista families on Nov. 23.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita representative and third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said the event allows students and families in I.V. to enjoy the holiday together.</p>\n<p>“We prepare a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with turkey and mashed potatoes,” Hernandez said. “We hold this event because Isla Vista is very densely populated by college students and we often forget there are families in Isla Vista as well.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-66193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Attainable, Accessible, Affordable UCSB Coalition (AAAC) hosted an event titled “Teach In” at the MultiCultural Center theater Thursday night to educate students about tuition fees and student debt and to promote the upcoming “Million Student March.”</p>\n<p>AAAC collaborated with several other student organizations such as the Student Union, Office of the Student Advocate, Associated Students External Vice President of Student Affairs Office, UCSB-4-Bernie, A.S. Office of the President and UCSB University of California Student Association to inform attendees about issues surrounding the student march which will be held on Nov. 12 at 12:00 p.m. at Storke Plaza. UCSB will join over 90 other colleges, including all nine UC’s (excluding UC San Francisco), in marching to demand free public university tuition, the cancellation of all student debt and the installation of a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year sociology and Black studies double-major Mohsin Mirza said the Donahoe Higher Education Act, alternatively referred to as the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, made tuition free for UC schools when the UC system was first founded in the 60s. According to Mirza, the act was in place up until Ronald Reagan imposed a “student fee” to attend the universities and diverted UC funding to other, less productive activities.</p>\n<p>“[Reagan] saw the UCs as promoting — basically handing out free education to a whole bunch of would-be communists,” Mirza said. “He saw the UC’s principles to educate people as dangerous, and this tied into his ideas, which were generally against public spending.”</p>\n<p>I.G.N.I.T.E. Coordinator for the EVPSA office and fourth-year biology major Clare Idehen said Reagan diverted UC funding to prison spending and mass incarceration, which “disproportionally” affects Blacks and Latinos more than other ethnicities in America with one in three black men going to prison in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“Since the 80s, we’ve seen a huge 800 percent increase in the amount of people going to prison, and almost half of all the people incarcerated in prisons right now are for non-violent drug charges,” Idehen said. “Why are our prisons full of people who are non-violent?”</p>\n<p>According to Idehen, there are better ways to use the 80 billion dollars spent per year on mass incarceration in America.</p>\n<p>“With 80 billion dollars, we could provide preschool for every three-and-four-year-old in America, finance roads, bridges and airport jobs,” Idehen said. “And most importantly, allocate tuition at every public university and college.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Idehen said students around the globe are fighting for accessible education for all.</p>\n<p>“They’re fighting for the same thing we are,” Idehen said. “They’re not very different from us — they’re maybe 17 and 18, 19, maybe 16 years old going to college. They’re basically us. So it’s really great to stand in solidarity with these students, and I think it’s really important to know what’s happening.”</p>\n<p>UCSB United States Student Association Board of Directors Co-Chair and second-year political science major José Javier Magaña Mendoza said independent Vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders advocates for government subsidized college tuition through a Robin Hood Tax. According to Mendoza, it is an estate tax on stock and bond sales and a sales tax on commodities, debentures, derivatives and notes which will bring in an estimated 300 to 350 billion dollar in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“How the tax works is that it’s just a small financial transaction tax on Wall Street, a tax that is 0.5 percent on stocks, 0.1 percent on bonds and 0.00 percent on derivatives,” Mendoza said. “This helps us because it will go to things such as jobs, housing, affordability, child care, healthcare, transportation and a big investment on the infrastructure. As students, it also goes to our higher education.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA officer, Teach In event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said internal UC worker union AFSCME 3299 supports the Million Student March because the union cares about students and agrees with the $15 minimum wage demand for all UC workers.</p>\n<p>“All nine UC’s, except UCSF, are holding marches, and AFSCME 3299 covers all those different areas, so they’re going to be having a voice in this, but mainly stand in solidarity,” Butts said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, there has been a push for Chancellor Yang and the Vice Chancellors to attend the Million Student March.</p>\n<p>“All the A.S. Executives, the GSA president and the RHA president all signed letters requesting Chancellor Yang and all of the Vice Chancellors’ presence at this march,” Butts said. “We believe that this isn’t just a student issue or a worker’s issue, but this also has to do with UC as a whole.”</p>\n<p>Teach In speaker and third-year sociology major Alex Villegas said access to education is a global issue, and protests have been happening in London and Africa, with Africa’s protest breaking out into violence.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think a lot of people are really aware that our generation is facing this on a global level, and that we’re going to be impacted,” Villegas said. “It’s not just a temporary situation, but it’s something life-long.  It’s going to impact the future generations, and at the end of the day we’re going to end up inheriting all of this. Our leaders are setting us up for failure, so if we don’t take action now, we’re essentially all screwed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Casey Ramirez said he attended because he is struggling to afford tuition.</p>\n<p>“Debt is hard, and paying for things are a hardship,” Ramirez said. “It’s causing issues with my parents — we’re middle class and they have bad credit, so it’s hard to get loans.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said it will take a change in policy to ease the “deep debt” students in America are accumulating.</p>\n<p>“The money exists. We have enough money, we’re the richest country in the world to pay for free higher education,” Mirza said. “We all know all too well the impact the cost college can have on our families. The question is how can we make it so that this isn’t the case, so we can have the principle of free higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/","id":2640,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2639,2638,2637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program To Host Conference To De-stigmatize Alcohol and Drug Recovery","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/header_aod2013.jpg?resize=355%2C105&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/header_aod2013.jpg?resize=377%2C105&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program will host the California Unified Collegiate Recovery Program Nov. 7 and 8 in Corwin Pavilion to de-stigmatize alcohol and drug addictions and educate UCSB and SBCC st...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program will host the California Unified Collegiate Recovery Program Nov. 7 and 8 in Corwin Pavilion to de-stigmatize alcohol and drug addictions and educate UCSB and SBCC students about resources for recovery.</p>\n<p>The conference will host keynote speakers American Buddhist teacher and personal wellness believer Noah Levine, President and CEO of Young People in Recovery Justin Luke Riley and UC Riverside collegiate recovery program advisor Audrey Pusey. Each speaker will present an individual topic about the struggles and successes relating to recovery. Sponsors will offer resources and information to students, with organizers anticipating attendees from across the UC and out of state.</p>\n<p>UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program counselor and recovery specialist Angie Bryan said the conference can help break down preconceptions about the recovery process while creating a community for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“One goal is to bring students together in recovery just for fellowship and mutual support,” Bryan said. “We’re trying to promote awareness about being in recovery, and that people in recovery are assets to a college community … to reduce the stigma about being in recovery in college.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the recovery movement began at UCSB four years ago with the assistance of UC Riverside and has grown into a UC-wide program for addiction recovery.</p>\n<p>“I think initially the goal was to help start the movement in California,” Bryan said. “Four years ago, we were just starting our program here and Riverside had a student group, but there wasn’t else much happening in our state. Now we have collegiate recovery programs at most of the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Adam Daar said UC Riverside supports UCSB in hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“UC Riverside wanted to keep it student led, and I think that people liked the idea of bringing it to Santa Barbara because they saw that we had a strong collegiate recovery program community already,” Daar said. “We are really happy to be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year global studies major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Emily Bills, recovery programs have been growing rapidly in recent years and UCSB has one of the best programs to host the conference.</p>\n<p>“There are only so many recovery programs in California that are able to host. We have a huge support from the Alcohol and Drug Program that no other schools really have,” Bills said.</p>\n<p>According to Director of UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, the process of recovery will be destigmatized throughout the conference. Kurta said she hopes this will lead to more acknowledgement and support for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“I think there are assumptions made about how college students lead their lives,” Kurta said. “There’s stigma about people being in recovery or students who were struggling and not yet able to make a choice that is working well for them. I think our community needs to be more sensitive to being helpful and supportive and not being judging and off-putting in that way.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said the conference will also showcase UCSB’s efforts to improve the lives of students dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>\n<p>“We all saw it as a terrific opportunity to bring attention to the work that is being done and to applaud the efforts of the program and to bring some recognition to our campus, because people don’t always think of UCSB and sober living,” Kurta said. “It was an opportunity to say we have a thriving program, we have a very diverse community and our community can include students in recovery.”</p>\n<p>Daar said he hopes the conference can help unify colleges and create diverse alcohol and drug programs at different universities.</p>\n<p>“I think something the conference can do is [help] other schools with their recovery program and learn about our own and cultivate a space of learning … and expand the national recovery movement, especially on college campuses,” Daar said.</p>\n<p>Daar said all students and UCSB staff are welcome to attend the conference and can volunteer for the event to learn about recovery.</p>\n<p>“They can reach out to us and sign up for volunteer shifts,” Daar said. “They get free admission and are welcome to help out and attend the entire conference — they get all the information that is really guided for students.”</p>\n<p>Daar said if students are struggling with an addiction they should seek help and know that recovery teams are there for support.</p>\n<p>“Try really hard to not be afraid to ask for help. Know that no one in this recovery community is going to judge you for asking for help,” Daar said. “They can come to us to ask for help and they will be welcomed with open arms. I want them to know that.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the resources offered at the conference can be of help to anyone affected by addiction.</p>\n<p>“I just want to emphasize that everybody is touched by addiction in some way, whether it’s personally or [through] a friend or family member,” Bryan said. “I think that anyone could get something out of the conference.”</p>\n<p>The Alcohol and Drug Program offers weekly meetings open to all community members and hosts quarterly events. Services are primarily free to all students, including resources for being an ally in recovery.</p>\n<p>For more information about the conference and registration, visit <em>alcohol.sa.ucsb.edu</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/ucsb-alcohol-and-drug-program-to-host-conference-to-de-stigmatize-alcohol-and-drug-recovery/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/ucsb-alcohol-and-drug-program-to-host-conference-to-de-stigmatize-alcohol-and-drug-recovery/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/ucsb-alcohol-and-drug-program-to-host-conference-to-de-stigmatize-alcohol-and-drug-recovery/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/ucsb-alcohol-and-drug-program-to-host-conference-to-de-stigmatize-alcohol-and-drug-recovery/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/ucsb-alcohol-and-drug-program-to-host-conference-to-de-stigmatize-alcohol-and-drug-recovery/","id":2636,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2635,2634,2633],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":58,"route":"/categories/news/campus","highestPage":86}},"__N_SSG":true}
