About 92% of the building’s total space will be devoted to classrooms and lecture halls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance and Capital Strategies Committee is comprised of UC Regents as well as other advisory members, including Governor Gavin Newsom, UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors from some of the UC campuses. They approved UCSB’s new building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with new building projects at the Riverside, Berkeley and San Diego campuses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 16 at the UC Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new building projects are part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UC’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>; the plan was implemented by the Regents in 2010, with the purpose of “shap[ing] how the campus will develop to the year 2025, including changes in our academic programs and the development of additional campus housing for students, faculty, and staff,” according to UCSB’s Design, Facilities, and Safety Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, UCSB’s new Classroom Building will cost $97,133,000; 82% of funding is from state appropriations of $79,787,000, while 18% is from campus funds, which are non-state, non-tuition reserves from grants, investments and sponsored contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A portion of state appropriations will also come from state funding previously allocated for the Campbell Hall Replacement Building. Originally, the funding was allocated to tear down and replace Campbell Hall; however, concerns of the project’s financial feasibility, combined with immediate safety concerns, led UCSB to implement critical life-safety improvements and repairs in order to ensure safe, ongoing use of Campbell Hall, according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal states the new building will also alleviate problems of over-enrollment which have contributed to lower four-year graduation rates. UCSB’s registrar cited “lack of classrooms and inappropriately sized classrooms as the primary cause of … increasing student waitlists that tend to affect the four-year graduation rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Classroom Building will accommodate more than “twice the capacity and many more rooms than the previous Campbell Hall plans,” according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other alternatives to the Classroom Building discussed in the proposal include leasing off-campus space or annexing existing academic and administrative building space, but these ideas were not deemed viable by the committee because all other existing facilities on campus are already fully occupied, and “logistical problems” prevented leasing buildings in Isla Vista for classroom use.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88801\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88801\" data-attachment-id=\"88801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/screen-shot-2019-05-29-at-3-32-34-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=1200%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 3.32.34 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=888%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88801 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Proposed design for the new Classroom Building, located between the Psychology building and Davidson Library. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to substantially increasing the amount of classroom space on campus, the Classroom Building will also incorporate more modern classroom designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current classrooms are “exclusively traditional in format … lack[ing] the flexibility, amenities, and technology needed to accommodate contemporary, project-based learning,” according to the proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three active learning classrooms in the Classroom Building are designed for project-based teaching and group and student participation, with flexibility to arrange furniture and digital and visual technology for each class’s specific needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional discussion classrooms will include moveable furnishings and digital capability for project-based work, and lecture halls will be designed with rotating seats, allowing “turn-to-team” interaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Classroom Building plan also requires the demolishing of Building 408, which holds the </span>McCauley Lab in EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) and the Passow Lab in MSI (Marine Science Institute), along with various graduate and faculty offices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus bike path runs through the future construction site for the Classroom Building;

The new space is 981 square feet and has two offices and a bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center currently has approximately 550 square feet and is composed of one small room and an office. But this current space is not large enough to accommodate to students in need of private meeting spaces, according to Coby Dillard, veterans and military services coordinator.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard said an ideal “one-stop shop” resource center would have an academic advisor, a counselor and a certifying official who can double as a financial aid representative and provide any other resources that an incoming veteran student would need, all in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Dillard said, when a student comes to the center, he can “help to a degree,” but at the end of the day, he often has to direct them to multiple different places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Research says that if you have individuals who can come into a single location and get all their assistance, over the long-term, they perform better academically,” Dillard added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new location takes a step toward a “one-stop shop” with larger square footage and dedicated meeting rooms, which Dillard can use to set up office hours for various advisors to drop in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Dillard isn’t the first one who has tried to turn the center into a “one-stop shop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, two student veterans presented a list of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/veterans-fight-for-more-resources-at-ucsb/\">grievances and demands</a> for change to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First on the list of demands was a “space that can continuously accommodate quiet study, lounge, peer to peer tutoring, mental health and VA counseling…. These rooms will not be decentralized and will share a similar location or structure.” But Dillard described this demand as only partially fulfilled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, the center occupied a 10-by-10 foot space in building 477, across the courtyard from the current office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the demands, roughly 400 members of the entire student body were military-related, which includes veterans, military dependents, reserve duty students and more. Dillard said that number has now increased to over 520. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the one-stop shop model is years in the making, the center’s high staff turnover made it difficult for any real progress to be made, according to Dillard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard is the fourth person since 2012 to run the program. The first two coordinators stepped down to go back to school, and the third served as an interim coordinator until Dillard was hired in July 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff turnover is also the reason why so many of the unspoken agreements that the center has with other departments on campus are not formal policies, Dillard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Institutionally, a lot of our policies exist, but they’re not formalized anywhere,” Dillard said. “I know all the veterans get priority registration… And then the question in here is ‘Is there a formal written policy?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of my relationships with other offices across campus are based on understandings that have worked, not necessarily formal policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Dillard came to UCSB, his goal for his first year was “just stabilizing the place.” From there, Dillard said he moved on to assessing which areas of the center were in need of the most attention, and how he could best go about fixing them next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UCSB as the number four public school in the nation for veterans and 10th nationwide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but Dillard finds that “rankings like that don’t necessarily reflect what the student experience is because that particular ranking did not ask any questions about the student experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Dillard finds that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s survey, “Best for Vets” is a better metric as it accounts for “services and student experience.” Next year, Dillard plans to have veteran students at UCSB complete the survey so the university can be ranked on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survey.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard’s ideas for the center stem from years of experience of working with veterans, most recently in Virginia Beach, Va. Dillard said that coming to UCSB and working as a coordinator was the next progression for his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After doing this for seven, eight years, this is kind of the next progression for me career-wise,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next natural step is to run a program and if you’re going to run a program, [UCSB’s program] wouldn’t be bad to start with [because it is] one that is in need of some sort of strengthening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his first Memorial Day at UCSB, Dillard wanted to not only honor former and current service members, but also make the holiday more visible to the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the Veterans and Military Services program installed a “flag garden” made up of 2,000 flags planted in the open green space between the Annex and Storke Lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think everyone either appreciated it being there, or once they were told why it was there, then they appreciated it being there,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like this are one way for Dillard and the program to increase visibility and awareness of veteran students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Dillard has several aspirations for the center in the next few years, the most significant one is emphasizing the importance of developing the Veterans and Military Services program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one actually has been here long enough to take it from a resource center to a program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard hopes to be the one to change this.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 30, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

year.<em> </em></span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plaintiff in the most recent case, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lee Reyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is UC Santa Barbara UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles. Antonio Castillo, a lawyer handling the cases from Richie Litigation, said in an email that the three cases “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are exposing long-term systemic systems of bullying and the suppression of the advancement of minority police officers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Smith, the plaintiff in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only officer of the five who worked with a different attorney, Peter Horton, to file his claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits brought forward by Reyes, Signa and the Littles are steps toward addressing the department’s alleged misconduct, according to Castillo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That these brave officers have come forward and inspired many more to do so means that we finally have an opportunity to make real progress in changing how the UCSB Police Department operates,” Castillo said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

a payroll system meant to streamline the way payroll functions, was implemented on UCSB and other UC campuses throughout the course of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program’s website promises “Efficient, accurate payroll” — but since UC Path’s implementation, students across the UC have complained about delayed, missed or wrong pay, causing tension between the administration and students at the UC’s perceived inaction in fixing UCPath issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For most employers, not paying workers on time is a form of wage theft — but the University of California is currently exempt from the state’s strict wage theft laws,” a press release sent out by United Auto Workers Union (UAW) on Friday stated. UAW </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held a rally in March 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protest the implementation of UCPath. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW President Kavitha Iyengar said in the press release that the union is “encouraged” and “looking forward” to seeing the bill move onto the Assembly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no penalty for this, UC chose to use its own workers as an interest-free bank as they worked out the system’s glitches. Without accountability measures in place, we have no doubt that UC will continue to take advantage of workers who have no legal recourse,” Iyengar said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2019, the UC Office of the President </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took its first steps towards addressing the issue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of missed payments, offering varying amounts of money to approximately 750 workers who had been affected by UC Path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 698, co-authored by Senator Connie Leyva and Senator Scott Wiener, takes a step beyond the offered compensation and would make it a requirement for the UC system to pay its workers on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California law requires that employees be paid twice a month on designated “regular pay days”; workers classified as executive, administrative or professional employees can be paid once a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed through the California State Assembly and signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would require that university employees who are paid on a monthly basis be paid “no later than 5 days after the close of the monthly payroll period.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the bill would require the university to create payroll regulations for employees who are paid on a “more frequent basis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating current California payment law results in a misdemeanor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC doesn’t pay workers “on time and on a regular payday,” employees can file a claim in state court or with the Labor Commissioner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC Path serves UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UCOP and UCSB. UC Regents plan to implement UCPath at the rest of the UC campuses over the next several years, according to the bill.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Much of the night, however, was filled with silence as they mourned their friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students wrote on a large sheet of paper placed on a table next to a picture of Wang, sharing their favorite memories and expressing how much they missed her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the table were flowers and cookies. Wang’s mother wanted cookies there to symbolize how much her daughter loved to bake, Pahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that Wang was so good at baking that her mother eventually stopped ordering from caterers and just let her daughter bake for her events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students who did speak about Wang shared what a positive person she was. For one student, Wang’s enthusiasm was the most contagious thing he said he had ever experienced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another of Wang’s friends, who is a photographer, remembered that she used to ask why he always wanted to take pictures of her when they were at an event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wherever she was, “she made it that much more fun,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said it was hard to talk about Wang but said she was a “great person who I made a lot of memories with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two would spend countless hours talking about anything and everything after general meetings at the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most amazing thing about Annie is that she was very well spoken and very articulate about what she said,” Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said one night he went to drop off Wang, but the two found themselves talking through the night instead. While the two were chatting, Pahl accidentally left the emergency lights on his car on. By the time he went to his car, the battery was dead. While he waited for help, Wang was there to keep him company, talking with him for nearly another hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other friends shared stories of Wang always putting others before herself and being there for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Roy, a fourth-year student at UCSB, also recalled one of her favorite memories of Wang. The two met because Wang would study at San Rafael Residence Hall, where Roy lived, even though Wang was a resident of Manzanita Village. Because of this, Wang would routinely lock herself out late at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roy said she would usually be up late as well and would always let Wang back in the hall. Roy once asked Wang why she would always go out late at night, despite knowing she had no way back in the dorm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best time to see a shooting star is to go outside at midnight and look straight up at the sky,” Wang responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night, Roy took Wang’s advice. Though it took a few days, she finally saw her first shooting star.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, Annie was a light,” Roy said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

We do have a large community, and hopefully that moves at least one person to stay in college. We would have another queer person of color being able to graduate college, when statistically speaking, it is already hard to get in here, and even harder to [graduate],” said Ricardo Uribe, a former Letters and Science senator with the 69th Senate.</p>\n<p>Photos of the event captured by <em>Nexus</em> photographers can be viewed below:</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88624-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88615\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88614\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88620\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88622\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1203\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88621\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88617\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88616\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88613\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88612\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88611\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Each bench had a photo of the victim as well as a short paragraph about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd entered Anisq’oyo Park, Kira Weiss, Ph.D. ethnomusicology student at UCSB, played several songs on the cello to welcome them in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once everyone was settled in, Weiss played a theme composed by Heena Yoon, Ph.D. candidate in music, three times in a row, and asked the audience to hum along. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theme, called “Hope in the Labyrinth,” has been played every year since 2014, Weiss said, but this is the first time she has been able to play it at the annual vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The indication for how to play [the theme] is slowly, in grief, but then it’s also supposed to be hopeful too and I think [Yoon’s] idea with everybody humming together is like trying to find connection and find the strength of our voices together,” Weiss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer and Collins Puente spoke once again after the cello music and thanked the audience for attending before introducing the first speaker of the evening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a heartfelt turnout from our students, our staff and our colleagues, professors and our community members,” Yang began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are all coming together as a community to honor and remember one of the campus’s most difficult moments. Five years ago, our university faced an unthinkable tragedy. We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang went on to name each of the victims and talked about the hopes, dreams and ambitions they carried. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each of these six students were shining stars, beaming with the same brilliance and warmth like the candles among us,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next speaker, UCPD Officer Ariel Bournes, touched upon his own experience as a first responder that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes, who studied art at UCSB, worked as a community service officer (CSO) when he attended UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes later worked on community outreach for the UCSB police department for several years. But at the end of the day, he found that many of the conversations he had with students and community members ended with them expressing frustration that other police officers didn’t feel the same way as he did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of the conversations ended something like this: ‘Hey Ariel, that was awesome that you came out, and you listened, and you conversed with us. But here’s the thing: you’re not even a police officer!’” Bournes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I heard that speech one too many times, I decided, ‘I’m gonna become a police officer.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a goofy kid who “regularly walked around with paint splattered on [his] clothing from various art projects [he] was working on,” Bournes said even his own mother didn’t think he could become a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he faced the same sentiment from several other police officers in the department, there was one officer who Bournes said gave him a chance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of them said, ‘Okay, you should come on a ride-along with me.’ So we looked at our schedules, we worked it out and we circled the date.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes paused for a long time, as audience members began to put the story together in their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he finally spoke again, his voice cracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“May 23, 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Less than 30 minutes into my first police ride-along, the shooting started. I got a front row seat to things that no one should ever have to see. And here I stand, five years later, now an officer myself, thinking back to that moment, and thinking back to the hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of moments that we all shared as a community in the aftermath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing Bournes wanted attendees to remember was how the community responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used art and protest and therapy and faith and food and tears and research and collaboration and passion and planning in order to heal and to protect and to overcome. It was exemplary. It was astonishing. And it was, and it is, an honor and a privilege to be counted as even a small piece of this community. Isla Vista, you are the template.

Klawunn, who arrived on campus in Fall Quarter 2015, spoke about how even though she wasn’t here when the community suffered the tragedy, she was able to see how it came together in the months and years afterward to become stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have learned so much about [the victims’] legacies through the values of community here,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love the features of our everyday lives that arise from the love and strength that members of this community found in themselves in 2014, like the cranes in the Student Resource Building, the lights in the tunnel that we walked through tonight and in the Love and Remembrance Garden,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parents of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Katie Cooper and George Chen all spoke at the memorial event as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Martinez, Christopher Michaels-Martinez’s father, read a poem by Courtney Martin titled “A Responsibility to Light.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The poem urged listeners to feel their emotions strongly, even the difficult ones, and to use those feelings to drive them to create art of any kind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Cooper, Katie Cooper’s father, talked about how much his daughter loved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had offers at three other universities, and came here on an open event; it was kind of an open house, with one of her girl friends. And in about ten minutes she was like ‘This is where I needed to be,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just loved it, and really felt at home here, and I think that’s a tribute to everybody who’s here today, and what you’ve brought to the community and what you’ve brought to the university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly Wang, George Chen’s mother, thanked the audience, and the two fathers, for helping her feel like she isn’t going through this alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As you all see, it’s not easy, and it’s even heartbreaking, for me to be here, because I know at the end of this trip, coming all the way from San Jose, I won’t be able to see the beautiful face of my son George,” Wang said. “However, I choose to stand here, bravely, because I want to share some of the words from my heart with you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“First, I want to say, with a mother’s heart, I care about you, and I think every student of UCSB, or every college student, is my child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang urged audience members to always be kind, even in little ways, to the people around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wang, several long-time community members – Associated Students Executive Director Marisela Marquez, Ph.D. candidate Melissa Barthelemy, I.V. Community Services District General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Educational Opportunity Program Director Aaron Jones – all spoke about how moved they were by the way I.V. came together in the days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the memorial came to an end, Collins Puente tearfully thanked the audience for attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And thank you to everyone that continues to create and hold space for our beloved community.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p>Further photos of all of the memorial events held between May 18 and May 23 can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/in-photos-five-years-since-may-23-2014/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

News Editor Katherine Swartz to discuss his work this past year, his thoughts on how young people should get involved in their communities and what comes next for him.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read the Q&amp;A below: </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Why did you decide to come to speak at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I look at California…. there’s a lot of love from March for Our Lives in California, for many students especially. We go to UC Irvine all the time, or we did over the election, because that’s where a lot of young people can have the largest impact. I wanted to come and speak at UCSB because you know, it’s a cool school. There’s a lot of youth here that can have a big impact on elections, [who can] vote for morally just leaders that care about us. </span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first hear about the Isla Vista tragedy? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first heard about [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting]… I think I was relatively young. There’s been so many shootings in California [and] as I’m sure many people realize, they kind of all end up coming together in our minds, which is horrible because they shouldn’t in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I can say is that [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting] proves that we don’t just need states like California with stronger gun laws. We need states all over, all around the county, with stronger gun laws. We need support for victims in the first place, and for people to remember the fact that oftentimes, people don’t [support victims]… If we say Santa Fe, Texas, where there was a shooting right after Park[land] and then a couple months after, and no one remembers it. There’s a problem there. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you spoken at any other schools that have experienced shootings in the past? What’s that like, that they’ve gone through what you previously went through?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know if I’ve spoken at any schools that have gone through shootings in the past, I can’t remember. I’m sure there’s been individual shootings that have happened on various campuses that I’ve been at, [and there are] individuals that have been affected by gun violence in the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I always ask, is I ask everybody to raise their hand that’s in the crowd that’s been affected by gun violence. There’s an unbelievable number of hands that go up. It’s always really hard because you realize, what I’ve realized in doing this work, is that it’s not just one community that’s traumatized by gun violence, that goes through mass shootings. It’s literally everywhere in the United States that go through everyday shootings where kids are lost on a daily basis. People are lost in mass shootings, suicides, every day, as a result of easy access to firearms. </span></p>\n<p><b>Can you walk me through some of the work you’ve been doing in the past, just an overview of that? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the past year, a week after the shooting at my school, we went out with one message and that was: vote. Vote not for Democrats or Republicans, but morally just leaders that care about kids and young people dying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s what we focused on. We went out and… we registered thousands of young people to vote. And then after that we did a bus tour around the country, some letter writing, but more nationally…  [We] went to congressional districts where young people could have the largest impact on elections, then went to those congressional districts, registered voters, had town halls, formed a chapter there and got people active and involved in their community. We were able to vote out more NRA-backed politicians than ever before in American history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, the NRA is kind of falling apart at the seams right now. That’s in part because of some of the work that we’ve been doing as well… the one question I always have is how the hell is the NRA a nonprofit, when they take millions of dollars in contributions from gun manufacturers on an annual basis. The way I think about it is, imagine if big tobacco companies that benefit from selling as many cigarettes as possible and then end up causing cancer, was a nonprofit. And that’s what the NRA is basically – [it is] violence in this county and around the world at this point. They’re expanding a lot. </span></p>\n<p><b>With the recent kind of falling apart, more and more, of the NRA, what will you and the others keep doing moving forward?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re focusing a lot more on what we’re fighting for. We’re focusing on how we’re fighting for peace in our communities. The fact that we live in one of the most violent countries in the world, being a more developed country, but still being extremely violent, [seeing] everyday acts of gun violence and shootings on a daily basis is a problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in the fact that we’re complicit in gun violence around the world. When I’m in California and places that are further south along the Mexico border, [what] I think about a lot of the time is – in Florida we don’t have this, because we don’t border Mexico – but in a lot of southern states like Texas, Arizona, and so on and so forth, do, and I think about the fears like the Trump Administration tries spreading about asylum seekers coming to the border from Guatemala and Honduras. The fact that they don’t talk about how literally we give a lot of guns </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most of the guns that are used to kill civilians in Guatemala and Honduras or families that are caught in the crossfire as a result of the war on cocaine that the United States is trying to fight there </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are American-made guns that we’re complicit in. And then when these people, essentially refugees, start coming to our border, fleeing violence that we’re complicit in, and we tell them to go back, we’re committing an act of genocide. </span></p>\n<p><b>What made you decide to take a gap year to keep continuing this activist work for the past year? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted more time to heal. I wanted more time to speak to as many students across the country as possible. I also know that I would be extremely bothered by being in school. If I was in school during the election, I [would have] felt like I failed and I wasn’t doing as much as I could. So I took that gap year to work as much on the election as possible. </span></p>\n<p><b>So now that you’re starting school in the fall and you’ll be a full time student again, what are your plans moving forward with your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to continue pushing. Not so much fight against something per se anymore, like we fought a lot against the NRA, which is a major part of this problem, but shifting our focus on what we’re actually fighting for in the future, which is a peaceful, nonviolent or significantly less violent America, where people don’t have to worry about whether or not they’re going to go through a shooting at their school. People won’t have to worry where an exit is in their classroom or a movie theater or anywhere else where shootings have happened, and nobody has to worry about living through a drive-by shooting or active everyday gun violence as millions of kids across the United States do on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully what I hope we can do is start [to] fund programs that use community based violence intervention, that hire former convicts. I’ve [looked at] the criminal justice system and [seen how] oftentimes [people] have caused violent acts or even killed someone, and reform themselves after going through the criminal justice system for 30 odd years or some odd years and come back and stop kids from going down the same path they’re going down, without incarcerating more youth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realized that if putting more people in prison actually reduced gun violence in America, we wouldn’t be having his problem right now, with the highest prisoner population in the world. </span></p>\n<p><b>What shape will this work take now into the future? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what it has to take is young people running for office and young people voting and not thinking of themselves as Democrats or Republicans, but thinking about what’s moral and right in the first place. Thinking about an America where we don’t have to constantly be so divided along party lines, but [where] we’re united against all forms of injustice and we’re all fighting against those forms of injustice, whether it be economic oppression, racial oppression, or any other form of injustice, because what gun violence is is a measure of injustice a community faces. The more gun violence a community has, the more injustice it actually faces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, like in Isla Vista or Parkland, both of those shootings are a result of political injustice… They should’ve been stopped way before Columbine, right? We should have put laws in place. When there [were] the first mass shootings in American history, we could have stopped these things in the first place, but they didn’t because we have politicians on both sides of the political aisle that are complicit in gun violence. We have to unite and rally for morally just leaders that care about gun violence and care about people dying, which is sad. It really is. But that’s what we have to do. We need young people to realize there’s extreme, large amounts of power that is not utilized at a local level, especially in local politics where much of it is essentially an elected cocktail party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what I’ve seen, people don’t run because they want to actually help their community; they run because they liked the title and the status that it brings them. We need to change that. We need kids to go out there and represent their community and realize that, even on our school boards </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there’s many places across the United States where you don’t even have to be 18 to run for school board, there is no age limit </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and you can do that. There’s inherently a problem if we say we live in a representative democracy and we aren’t accurately represented by age, like how old congress is… There’s so many young people that are not represented in this county that only will be represented when they run for office themselves. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you say to students who feel passionately about this issue and want to get involved but don’t know how and can’t necessarily run for office? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a chapter on the UCSB campus here, the March for Our Lives chapter, that does voter registration. We work on candidate town halls. We work on a multitude of subjects along with also just learning about gun violence and talking about gun violence, where students can come together and work around an issue. You can get politically involved without having to run for office, but also make a change in [your] community. </span></p>\n<p><b>As Isla Vista remembers five years since our tragedy, where do you hope the national conversation on gun violence will be five years from now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope [gun violence] doesn’t have to exist anymore because we [will] create actions that are in place and stop something like Isla Vista or Parkland, or any active everyday gun violence from occurring every again… I think in the future people are going to have this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for lack of a better word </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘come to Jesus’ moment where they’re like, ‘How the hell did it takes us this long to actually respond to this issue, and how many people do we let die when we realized this was an issue but chose to do nothing about it?’ Because the thing that’s stopping us from ending gun violence and stopping all forms of shootings isn’t whether or not we care. It’s not whether or not young people in Isla Vista or Parkland, or Jamaica, Queens </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where my friend Erica Ford works </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or anywhere else, care. It’s not about Americans caring.

He will enter college in fall 2019 with the class of 2023. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on Feb. 14, 2018 in Parkland, Fla., Hogg has been in the national spotlight for the past year as a vocal advocate for gun control legislation and voter registration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg’s talk is part of a greater conversation on campus this week around gun violence in light of the fifth anniversary of the Isla Vista shooting, something Hogg briefly referenced in the beginning of his speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not going to do a moment of silence because, to be frank, I fucking hate moments of silence,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like we always hear in Congress, our politicians go, ‘Let’s just not talk about this. Let’s be quiet’… if we go out and speak about how to actually stop shootings from happening, that’s being too political because it stops the people in Congress that make money off of gun violence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg’s speech centered on his background as an activist over the past year after being thrust into the national conversation around gun violence. He also spoke on a variety of political issues during his speech, including mass incarceration, immigration and U.S. foreign policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Hogg, guns were always a part of his life; his father, an FBI agent, instilled in him a “respect” for gun ownership. He clarified to the audience that he is not anti-Second Amendment but feels the National Rifle Association (NRA) does not look out for gun owners like Hogg’s father. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s almost like they don’t actually care about anyone’s safety, not even people they claim to protect,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg spoke in unexpectedly candid detail about his experience during the Parkland shooting, describing the confusion of himself and his fellow classmates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everybody’s freaking out. There’s people having panic attacks. There is an incredible amount of dread. It’s dark because we don’t want [the] shooter to see us. Everybody’s trying to be quiet while also telling all their parents everything that they want to say before they die,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even when speaking about the shooting, Hogg’s message was highly political. As he waited in a classroom, unaware of the shooter’s location, he said he pulled out his camera and interviewed students to send a message of gun reform to national politicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many of them talked about the NRA … so that if we did die, they couldn’t say that ‘talking about gun violence is standing on the bodies of dead children’ if those dead children want you to be talking about gun violence,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we died in that classroom, hopefully our voices would carry on and create some kind of change in a place that clearly fucking needs it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the same day of the shooting after Hogg was cleared to evacuate the school, he began talking to media outlets at the scene and organizing what would become March for Our Lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I needed to speak for those that couldn’t speak at the time … [I wanted] what happened at our school to create some change. I wanted our school [to] not just be another name on a list of schools that have gone through school shootings, but a name that people remember. Not something where people feel pity for the school or anything like that, but feel empowered and know that those kids did something,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg began to realize the greater power of the March for Our Lives movement when over a million people marched around the world on March 24, 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I will always remember as well is the mirage of heat that came off the crowd in Washington DC, on a pretty relatively cold March day,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I knew that that was the heat that could create change, that was the heat that had fueled movements previously and that was the heat that was going to fuel this movement as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step for the March for Our Lives movement was Road to Change, a cross-country bus trip to speak with other activists and register young people to vote. The trip was inspired by the Freedom Riders of the civil rights movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What Parkland went through as a predominantly white community… we understood that we didn’t live through everyday acts of gun violence. If we actually do want to work [on] significantly reducing gun violence … we had to work with every community and not speak for anybody else and bring people on the bus with us from around the country,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When speaking with gun reform activists in East Oakland, Hogg realized the normalcy of gun violence in other communities when a shooting happened a few blocks away during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hear a pop, and I looked at them, and they’re like, ‘Oh, that was a car backfiring,’ and then we hear several more, and it was a shooting right next to us at the same time. That doesn’t make it on the news because it’s not a mass shooting and doesn’t get treated nearly the same way, which is wrong and shouldn’t happen,” Hogg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Road to Change, Hogg also encountered people across the country who are against gun control legislation and challenged the notion that gun ownership equates to freedom during his speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is freedom if we’re dead? What is freedom if we can’t fucking survive high school because we get shot either on our way to school or we get shot in our classroom, [which is] supposed to be the safest place in America for every young person to learn and thrive? What is freedom if we were constantly going out there, and we don’t actually have our votes count because we are continuously disenfranchised?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on his work in the past year as a leader of March for Our Lives, Hogg focused on voter registration in the 2018 elections and legislative victories across the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By one year after the shooting … we had gotten 67 gun laws passed at the state level, we had gone to competitive congressional districts around the country and met amazing young people around the country that had experienced gun violence and [used] that trauma not as a dividing factor as the people in power want us to use it, but as a uniting factor to make sure that nobody else has to live through it ever again in any zip code, in any community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election was the highest in modern American history at 38%, but this is only the beginning for Hogg, who is aiming for 71% youth voter turnout in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year biology major Lisa Liu, who attended Hogg’s talk on Tuesday, said she has a personal connection to the March for Our Lives movement that drew her to the talk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was a senior in high school, that’s when the shooting happened at Parkland, and me and a few students put on a march for our own school,” Liu said. “I just wanted to learn more about his story because it impacted our community, and I’m from Thousand Oaks, so there’s currently a history of gun violence,” referencing the recent Borderline Bar &amp; Grill shooting in Thousand Oaks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of his talk, Hogg challenged the audience to take his story and create political change in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I ask is when you leave this room, go and talk to your friends about registering to vote. Go and bring your friends to the polls. Go out there and vote for morally just leaders that care about young people and whether or not we make it through the school day and whether or not we survive in our own communities; whether or not we have to think on a daily basis of whether or not we’re going to live or die, because that is not what freedom looks like,” Hogg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this conversation dies in this room, I have failed.”</span></p>\n<p><i>[Editor’s Note]: Before speaking to UC Santa Barbara in Campbell Hall, Hogg sat down with </i>Daily Nexus<i> Asst.

Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño first introduced a modification to Legal Code at the Feb. 6 Senate meeting that would codify the one-time exception process that Salari went through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referred to as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing Policy 36</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the legislation would have updated Legal Code to clarify the consequences and proper procedures moving forward for senators “who [were] voted in to represent a certain sector of the student body but due to external circumstances no longer can identify with those constituents,” the policy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer “identify[ing] with those constituents” includes living off-campus when they were elected as on-campus senators or changing colleges as a collegiate senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Standing Policy 36, senators would have been allowed to continue serving in their positions if the Senate felt they were adequately “attending office hours, attending BCU meeting[s], attending senate meetings, and [fulfilling] their other senatorial duties outlined per legal code,” and granted them an exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was tabled for a week at the Feb. 6 meeting. All bills are required to be tabled for a week before they are voted on, per Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 13 meeting, several senators raised concerns about the Senate being the ones to grant an exemption, given that it is a partisan body. Standing Policy 36 was voted on and failed with nine yeses, ten noes and two abstentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 20 Senate meeting, Uribe and Briseno introduced another bill to update the eligibility section of Legal Code. This one, however, gave the power to grant exemptions to the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.), who runs for the position independently and is required by Legal Code to be nonpartisan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill also broadened the scope of who could receive exemptions, allowing for an elected official, including the S.A.G., to be granted an exemption for not meeting the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/s-a-g-martinez-found-in-violation-of-legal-code-by-a-g-safadi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found in violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the very same portion of Legal Code by A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi, who released a statement on Feb. 26. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the statement, Safadi acknowledged that “the course of action regarding Ms. Martinez becomes unclear due to the fact that the requirements for elected officers start and end in that very article [of] the Legal Code.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she interpreted that portion of legal code as an expectation, and not an obligation, in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That bill was also </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tabled for a week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 27 Senate meeting, the bill was tabled once again. Uribe said that Elections Board had reached out to him and Briseño, asking for clarification about the bill. Since neither of them could meet with the Board before the Senate meeting, they decided to postpone the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Uribe said he and Briseño have been unable to meet with Elections Board, particularly since all parties were busy with Spring 2019 elections. The bill has now essentially termed out, Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said that he had no plans to introduce a new version of the bill at the 69th Senate’s last meeting this Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was the only senator who is really interested in fulfilling the bill,” Uribe said. “There were people who I knew who agreed, who would have voted for the bill and who would have definitely loved it, but just not enough people…. the way I saw it, there was not enough people to get it passed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe still believes that some version of this bill is necessary, and said that he hoped Senator-elect Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who he has been training, will pick up where he left off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, Uribe said, a new bill would give senators the power to grant exemptions to executives, and vice versa, which would allow for A.S. to maintain a system of checks and balances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged the concerns other senators had raised about the Senate being partisan, Uribe said he didn’t believe it would be a problem because the vote would require a two-thirds majority, and one party typically does not win that many seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a clarification of the path forward for elected officials within A.S. who fail to meet the eligibility requirements, that portion of Legal Code will continue to be what several A.S. officials have referred to as a “gray area.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

/ Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill, introduced by California Senator Connie M. Leyva in December 2018, passed with 28 yeses and 10 noes. It would require all on-campus California public universities to provide the abortion pill at student health clinics, including UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Recent efforts across our country make it absolutely clear that women’s rights, particularly access to abortion, are under attack,” Leyva said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-05-20-senate-passes-leyva-bill-ensuring-college-students%E2%80%99-access-medication-abortion\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While other states are taking a giant step back to the days of outright misogyny and forced pregnancy, California continues to lead the nation by reaffirming the constitutional right to access abortion care without delay, including at student health centers on public university campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the press release, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leyva notes that “the lack of access to comprehensive and accessible reproductive care can hinder the well-being and academic success of college students,” adding that low income students and students of color are often disproportionately affected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of the UC or CSU student health center</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> currently provide abortion by “medication techniques,” according to the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 16, 2018, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a study announcing Mifeprex – the abortion pill – is </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safe and effective</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a statement Leyva echoed in her Monday press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pill has an approximate 95% success rate, according to the study. Mifeprex was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill (SB) 24 is the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/state-senator-reintroduces-bill-to-ensure-medication-abortion-access-at-public-universities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second version</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an “abortion pill” bill to go through the California legislature. Its similar predecessor, also authored by Leyva, failed to pass after former Governor Jerry Brown </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-30/governor-brown-vetoes-abortion-pill-bill/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vetoed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it in September 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his decision to veto the bill, Brown cited a study that stated the average distance between abortion providers and on-campus communities was five to seven miles – a distance, he said, that made the bill “not necessary.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SB 24 would give $200,000 to each public university health center for equipment, facility and security upgrades, staff reimbursement and training staff, among other uses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional $200,000 each would also be provided to both the UC System and the California State University system to pay for “24-hour, backup medical support by telephone to patients who have obtained abortion by medical techniques at a public university student health center,” one-time fees for providing “telehealth” services, bill specialist consultation and for “maintaining a system of financial reporting” of the fund. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money would come from “private funds” rather than student fees or university general funds monies, according to the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed by the California Assembly and signed by now-California Governor Gavin Newsom, all student health centers would be required to carry the pill by Jan. 1, 2023. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill’s text in full can be viewed </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB24\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

When I first came to UCSB, I didn’t really like it here, and being in the residential community was something that really changed that for me,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Voss said she recognized the importance of RHA’s primary focus on event planning and management, she felt that the association could further expand its supply of resources for residents by providing more professional and academic opportunities in the dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have safe, alternative events that people can go to. But I also think that’s not what makes living in the dorms better. I think what makes living in the dorms better is having different kinds of facilities, opportunities and resources that you don’t get off campus,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these insights in mind, Voss ran for RHA president against incumbent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle Bates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in spring  2018 and won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came into the position this year not necessarily knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew that I loved RHA’s mission, and I loved the fact that we get to do work that’s so personal and intimate,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Voss’s biggest goals this past year was working on the expansion of professional and academic resources for residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is currently implementing a series of workshops focused on event planning and management. The workshops would teach students the basics of event planning, from making room reservations to funding requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her presidency, Voss prioritized building connections with offices such as Residential and Community Living (RNCL) and Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE). She said that she noticed a disconnect between these entities and residents and took it upon herself to become an intermediary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not that these offices don’t care about these issues, it’s that they don’t know about them. Their offices are separate from students, and they don’t really employ students in their offices,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss explained that higher entities are often uninformed about everyday residential issues such as laundry malfunctions. She feels that by maintaining stronger channels of communication between these offices and RHA, these problems can be solved more efficiently and effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m someone who’s not really afraid to stand up and advocate for students, and I’m not someone who’s going to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. For me that has to do with going into a conversation with these offices with a really clear plan of exactly what I’d like to do,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is also committed to seeking creative, alternative sources for funding when entities like RNCL are not equipped to fund certain programs. This includes applying for grants from the Zero Waste Committee and seeking funds from other organizations on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we do have great sources of funding as RHA, I’m definitely willing to look to other resources if we can’t fulfill the kinds of things that I think are important to students through those resources,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As RHA president, Voss attended </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PACURH (Pacific Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls) housing conferences at UCLA and Southern Oregon University in November</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fifty schools from the Pacific Region, which includes California, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, were invited to the conference.. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss said the money for conferences came entirely from fundraising and not student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss also created “Resources with RHA,” a program that distributes hundreds of free midterm materials in the residence halls every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She  is also working with several members of RHA to create a new position in Hall Councils next year: an International Student Engagement Chair. The position will work closely with the Office of International Student Services (OISS) to ensure adequate resources and opportunities for international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her first year as RHA president, Voss decided to run again in an effort to accomplish her longer-term goals and projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant changes in leadership affect the productivity of student government each year, Voss said. This problem is especially pertinent for RHA, she added, since living in the residence halls is a requirement of being in the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single year RHA is completely different than the previous year, and very few of the projects are long-lasting,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss took 63% of the vote in this year’s RHA elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I can take a lot of things I’ve done this year and make it even better for next year in a way that leaves a stronger foundation for the next RHA,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited for the fact that in RHA we really have the agency to accomplish a lot of wonderful things, and that I feel like I have such a stronger idea of how RHA works and how to actually get projects off the ground,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Editor’s Note]: Laila Voss is a copy editor for the</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

When Al-Anbar was a student at UCSB, they spoke against <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">conservative speaker Ben Shapiro visiting campus </a>and organized <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/muslim-students-push-back-against-immigration-ban/\">a protest against the travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar also spoke about the value of setting aside time to take care of oneself.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you need a second to come to terms with [being] a QTPOC person in the job sector post-grad, take that. It’ll be okay,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of the student-led workshops, first-year film and media studies major Alexia Duran led a discussion about growing up queer while speaking a different language. Duran shared their story as a queer international student from Mexico, and how transitioning from Spanish, a heavily gendered language, to English impacted their own process of navigating their identity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“English, for me, has been an escape,” Duran said, as they described overcoming the barriers that exist in gendered languages such as Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, QTPOC conference organizers and participants were satisfied with the turnout and success of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m feeling very hopeful and want the conversation [about queer and trans students] to continue growing,” attendee Alvin Rios, a third-year student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the QTPOC conference to eventually grow and have a lot more visibility and presence. This is a great space for workshops, but obviously there’s a lot more narratives being left out that could be included in this.”</span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the event can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/in-photos-queer-trans-people-of-color-conference-2019/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 22, 1:29 p.m.]: A previous version of this article said Al-Anbar founded Students for Justice in Palestine.
