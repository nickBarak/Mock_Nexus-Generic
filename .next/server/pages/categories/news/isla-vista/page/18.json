The fee will be used to partially fund a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista to improve infrastructure, provide tenant-landlord mediation and institute community policing, among other services.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the legislation outlining the Isla Vista CSD, the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) sets the rate at which the CSD may levy its UUT. LAFCO approved an eighth percent UUT in April.</p>\n<p>Along with several other I.V. stakeholders, Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property provider, assembled Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes in September to build opposition toward the measure to approve the UUT, which requires a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>One of Eckert’s main objections to the measure, he said, is its potential to increase the cost of living for I.V. renters. Not only will renters have to pay the taxes for their own utilities, he said, but any tax paid by landlords will be added to renting costs.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he and many other I.V. property providers oppose higher rent because such price hikes will make their units less “attractive,” prompting renters to look elsewhere for housing.</p>\n<p>In a radio show with KCSB 91.9 FM in August, Yes on E&amp;F campaign organizer Jonathan Abboud said each person will pay between $5 to $10 per month for the UUT — “about half a Freebirds burrito once a month.”</p>\n<p>Although unable to provide numbers during an interview with the Nexus, Eckert said he anticipates much higher costs as a result of a UUT.</p>\n<p>“It’s certainly going to be more than half a burrito,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said the CSD will be ineffective in providing services to Isla Vista residents. Half of the funds raised by the tax will fund “bureaucracy,” he said.</p>\n<p>Citing a financial feasibility study organized by The Fund for Santa Barbara in Sept. 2015, Eckert said there will be an annual $512,000 revenue from the UUT. About half of that amount, $257,000, will go toward management and administration of the CSD, leaving $255,000 for other services.</p>\n<p>This, however, is not the only proposed means of funding CSD services. UC Santa Barbara has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years.</p>\n<p>Eckert also disapproves of Measure F because he finds it to be unfair; UCSB can have representation in the CSD board of directors despite not paying the UUT. According to AB 3, UCSB shall appoint one member to the CSD board of directors, yet, as the financial feasibility study reports, all utility consumption on UCSB land would be exempt from a new UUT.</p>\n<p>Despite starting a campaign against Measure F, Eckert has not come out in opposition to Measure E, the ballot measure to create the CSD in Isla Vista. As he put it, “one could be neutral on Measure E and still oppose Measure F.”</p>\n<p>But according to Darcel Elliott, the campaign manager for Yes on E&amp;F, opposition to Measure F is still opposition to Measure E. Disapproving of the means to fund the CSD, she said, will not allow the CSD to provide all of its enumerated functions.</p>\n<p>“You can’t have E without F,” she said.</p>\n<p>One might say that the fate of the CSD ultimately rests on the approval of a UUT at some point. AB 3 enumerates that, if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73143\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73143\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/","id":4646,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4645,4644,4643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Law Enforcement Down 30 Percent for Halloween","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Over 250 officers were stationed in Isla Vista last year, but community efforts to “keep things local” have convinced local police to cut down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_73129\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73129\" data-attachment-id=\"73129\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/halloween-2013/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"halloween-2013\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73129 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Halloween-2013.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Halloween weekend in Isla Vista has traditionally seen an influx in out-of-town visitors, but UCSB administration and local law enforcement have launched several alternative programs to increase community volunteering and limit large student crowds.

Less than 30 officers are expected to patrol on Sunday and Monday, he said.</p>\n<p>UCPD will be sourcing officers from seven different University of California campuses to supplement its staff. Officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, UC San Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Riverside will arrive at UCSB on Oct. 27 to attend a one-day training prior to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 UCPD officers were present in I.V. last year, Signa said, but this year “there’s a better understanding within the whole community, this idea of trying to keep it safe, keep it local.” He said initiatives like UC Isla Vista Volunteering Program have been “fantastic” at drawing students away from parties and toward local events.</p>\n<p>Although the department hopes to gradually decrease police presence by higher increments, “we’re always kind of nervous about what’s going to happen,” Signa said. UCPD can call on the Santa Barbara Police Department and additional UC officers in the case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>IVFP, an offshoot of the Santa Barbara County Police Department, plans to post approximately 100 officers in I.V. on Friday and Saturday, 50 officers on Sunday and 75 on Monday, according to IVFP Sergeant Chris Gotschall.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73145\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73145\" data-attachment-id=\"73145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/policestats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"357,181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"policestats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=250%2C127&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?resize=456%2C200\" alt=\"Icon courtesy of Symbolon; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus\" width=\"456\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=456%2C200 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=456%2C200 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Icon courtesy of Symbolon, Noun Project; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The department came to the decision after coordinating with both UCPD and UCSB administration. “Based on how much quieter Halloween was last year, they determined that they could actually decrease their coverage.” Gotschall said.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that this is a good sign; that things are more manageable in Isla Vista and on campus and the need for the presence of police officers is less,” Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers arrested less than 30 people during Halloween weekend last year, down from over 100 in years prior, and crime is expected to stay low this year. The department currently has no plans to bring horses into I.V. as mounted patrol units, but Gotschall said this could change in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want unsafe parties, we don’t want people coming in from all over to cause mischief,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because Halloween falls on a Monday this year, less activity is expected on Halloween Day. Gotschall said approximately 188 officers were patrolling I.V. on both weekend days in 2011, the last time Halloween was on a Monday.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, external vice president of local affairs, plans to continue alternative programming from last year. Businesses in the Downtown District participating in “Haunt the Loop” will share candy with trick-or-treaters, and volunteers will pass out water bottles to partygoers at “hydration stations” throughout Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board hosted Snoop Dogg for a sold-out concert on Halloween last year, and this year’s headliner will be announced in the three weeks leading up to Oct. 31.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

Kim Yasuda, a professor in the Department of Art, started a class called I.V. OpenLab to create projects for the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Organized by student volunteers from Yasuda’s class with support from Chancellor Yang, senior campus organizations advisor Viviana Marsano, I.V. Drip, Sorriso Italiano and Shave It, First Fridays were born.</p>\n<p>The events were not only for students, but for families and other residents who came together to strengthen the community. The first event was held in People’s Park, next to the Love and Remembrance Garden, a place described by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District as a “meaningful place for public commemoration and healing.”</p>\n<p>Marsano emphasized the importance of community in bringing the event to fruition. She credited the community and Rodney Gould, the General Manager of the I.V. Recreation and Parks District, who was integral to the organization of the event by helping secure permits and reserve the park.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District was listed as the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department in an earlier version of this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The project will aid the existing trees as well as plant 30 more.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Edible Campus Program will begin the restoration of the overgrown Sueno Orchard with a group of volunteers on Oct. 16.</p>\n<p>The Sueno Orchard, a project that developed in the 1980s, lives on 6723 Sueno Road and used to house a vast array of different fruit trees, from guava to mulberry, some of which are still present in the orchard today.</p>\n<p>According to Rodney Gould, Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) general manager, the group has been mulling over the project for the past three years, as community voices clamored for restoration of the orchard each year.</p>\n<p>The feat was delayed due to insufficient funds, Gould said, and residents redirected their efforts to other community projects following the May 2014 Isla Vista shooting.</p>\n<p>Now, the process seems to be on the path to fruition as IVRPD drafts proposals for the reinstallation of a drip irrigation system, the planting of new trees and care of existing trees.</p>\n<p>“We’re fulfilling a vision that has been requested for a few years here,” Gould said. He said recent community input indicated that the restoration process was still a pertinent issue for the residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the orchard has fallen into disarray over the years.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Peace Course, a professional disc golf association, has two holes on orchard grounds, and flying disc sports have caused damage to some of the trees’ trunks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the removal of the drip irrigation system and a statewide drought have also contributed to a number of the fruit trees’ untimely deaths.</p>\n<p>Gould emphasized the main goals of the restoration effort: to put in drip irrigation and to plant 30 new trees while saving the eight healthy trees that are already on the orchard grounds.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are mulberry, citrus, apple and guava trees on the grounds of the orchard, and the project will plant more of those trees and other native species.</p>\n<p>Gould said IVRPD is drafting grant proposals and looking for student groups that will help provide funds. IVRPD will also be looking for volunteers to help on their initial cleanup day.</p>\n<p>Additional aid will come from the Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the form of fruit tree donations. Recently, the Southern California Edison Electric Company removed a few trees from different parcels along the road during road work.</p>\n<p>Afterward, the Public Works Department contacted Gould and inquired whether they could plant trees in other I.V. parks as mitigation for the removed trees.</p>\n<p>Gould instead asked for fruit trees for the burgeoning orchard. The Public Works Department will now give IVRPD between five to seven trees in exchange, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been instrumental in raising campus and community awareness, and program coordinator Katie Maynard will be providing volunteers for the Oct. 16 cleanup day.</p>\n<p>The volunteers will be doing light trimming of the existing trees and will help build wells around those trees so that they don’t retain water while they are being watered.</p>\n<p>After the cleanup day, the process will continue with the installation of the irrigation system and the planting of the new trees. Gould said organizers hope to install irrigation prior to the middle of November and to install trees by late November.</p>\n<p>“People definitely utilize what’s there; people who have graduated also come back to Isla Vista and harvest the fruit,” Gould said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/","id":4643,"author":{"id":248,"name":"Persi Zamani"},"related":[4642,4641,4640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"8th Annual Pardall Carnival Showcases Campus Organizations, I.V.

IVCRC additionally reached out to local restaurants to cater to the event, such as Ike’s Place, Silvergreens and Blaze Pizza, altogether expanding the tasty range of amenities the carnival had to offer.</p>\n<p>Spudnuts Donuts drew in crowds with free donut bites, green tea boba and coupons for their next visit, nestled among the herds of passing students.</p>\n<p>“The main goal of the event is to start off the year with all of the community united,” said Jennifer Kim, external chair of IVCRC. “It isn’t closed off just to UCSB students; we aim for the families in the community to come out and enjoy the fun as well!”</p>\n<p>Organizations outside of USCB took advantage of this opportunity, inviting students to get to know the resources available to them beyond the campus in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Acacia Counseling and Wellness, for example, had a colorful board of post-its near the ferris wheel that carnival goers could add to. Students circled the board to write words of encouragement to share with their fellow peers, putting them on display to pass on to the next person in need of a positive pick-me-up.</p>\n<p>Ruby Aranki, a fourth year student and administrative manager of the organization, said the purpose of the activity is not only to “destigmatize the current notion of mental health but also raise awareness of the current outlets available to serve those who suffer with depression or anxiety disorders.” With their upcoming $1 yoga sessions available to all members of the Isla Vista community, Acacia plans to put all proceeds towards a student therapy fund for those unable to afford the cost of counseling.</p>\n<p>When asked about her impression of the I.V. community thus far, first-year student Emily Hong noted that she loved how the community is so tight-knit and welcoming and the fun extends “beyond the frathouse.”</p>\n<p>“It kind of reminds students that I.V. isn’t all about the party reputation you expect coming into it, and it’s completely avoidable if it’s not your thing,” Hong said. “In my opinion I thought the carnival was a great way to kick off the new year, and with all the food and carnival games there was something fun for everyone to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Kim rested easy at the end of the event she helped organize, noting that although it got hectic behind the scenes, the shortfalls meant nothing compared to the success of the event as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how it all came together the day of and all the happy faces of people coming to the stands, it really made the hard work pay off,” Kim said.</p>\n<p><em>See more at <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-01/in-photos-pardall-carnival-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">In Photos: Pardall Carnival 2016</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72779\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72779\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/","id":4625,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4624,4623,4622],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings On in I.V.

Organizers are also planning to host a “brainstorming session” next week about the community center which will take place the first weekend of October.</p>\n<p>There will be another meeting at 6 p.m. tonight in the I.V. Clinic building to discuss a proposed noise ordinance change for Isla Vista. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office proposed in August that the start of quiet hours be moved earlier from midnight to 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. At the meeting, students and Isla Vista residents will be able to voice concerns to officers regarding matters such as enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its annual Pardall Carnival on Saturday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The carnival will feature tables from many of the student groups and local organizations involved on campus and in Isla Vista. IVCRC will have a Ferris wheel on Pardall Road as well as live music from local bands. The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank will provide free food for attendees.</p>\n<p>A local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Division of Student Affairs will be hosting an evening of spoken word by artist Sunni Patterson on Tuesday, Oct. 4, at the St. George Family Youth Center (889 Camino Del Sur). The performance is part of the “Resilient Love” series that “asks how we can respond ethically and honorably to hate and violence.”</p>\n<p>Sunni Patterson will perform for another evening of spoken word on Wednesday, Oct. 5, alongside David Kyuman Kim and George Lipsitz at the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall. This event is again part of the “Resilient Love” series.</p>\n<p>Community volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters, registering as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record of 13,000 registered voters for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday, Oct.13, at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>The Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Vive El Arte SB is hosting a “Free Concert for the Family” at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, at Isla Vista Elementary School (6875 El Colegio Rd.). Mexico-City-based traditional band Yolotecuani sones de Guerrero will be performing at the event.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/","id":4509,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4508,4507,4506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Homeless Students Get Access to Showers","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4776_3.jpg?resize=300%2C201&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4776_3.jpg?resize=300%2C201&ssl=1","description":"Gov.

Jerry Brown signed into motion Friday a bill to give homeless students access to shower facilities on community college campuses.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 1995 (AB 1995), authored by Assemblymember Das Williams, will become effective Jan. 1, 2017, permitting homeless students to use these facilities. The bill also establishes an office to keep records, conduct outreach and maintain the program.</p>\n<p>The bill outlines that the use of the shower facilities for homeless students must be scheduled to not interrupt campus gym hours, and can only be used for two hours per weekday. AB 1995 also requires the college to maintain records of the student enrollment in the program and to reach out to homeless students on each campus.</p>\n<p>Existing law allows students to apply for waived enrollment fees when enrolling in community college. AB 1995 will require the waiver applications to include a question asking whether the applicant is homeless, beginning at the start of the 2017-2018 academic year.</p>\n<p>Data from the 2015 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) shows that approximately 58,000 college students are homeless nationwide. The County of Santa Barbara contains one of the highest percentages of homeless students in California at 11 percent (second only to Trinity County at 13 percent).</p>\n<p>Many local attempts have been made to alleviate this issue. Santa Barbara City College, for example, offers a wide array of services for students facing food insecurity and homelessness.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams worked closely with the bill since he was a homeless student himself. When he attended community college two decades ago, he lived in a vehicle and showered at the beach until he transferred to UC Berkeley.<br>\nIn an <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/sep/23/community-college-shower-access-bill-empowers-home/\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed</a> article submitted to the Santa Barbara Independent, Williams said he believes hygiene and appearance is a large part of being present in school.</p>\n<p>“This bill removes a major obstacle to attending class for some people,” Williams said in a press statement Friday. “Students won’t have to skip class because of personal insecurities or fear about class acceptance if they are able to shower on campus.”</p>\n<p>By imposing a state-mandated local program, Williams said the bill is trying to get the community active in revitalizing the lives of students.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, this bill would not have been introduced without the Student Senate for California Community Colleges (SSCCC) lobbying for it since it was introduced in February.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A County Redevelopment Agency planned to build a new space soon after, but the agency was later dissolved entirely due to financial setbacks.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2012, the County of Santa Barbara acquired a former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, bringing the fight for a community center back to the very heart of I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The location is adjacent to the Community Resource Building, Anisq’Oyo’ Park, the I.V. Food Co-Op and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks Department, a few historical tenants of community organization in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 Community Development Block Grant in 2015 to refurbish the former church building, the building seemed to be in promising hands.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) held a launch party last October to celebrate the future renovations, and local groups began using the facilities for informal events.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Friends of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a group that has been meeting regularly for two years, began working with the budget to hire an architecture firm, create a single bathroom facility and refurbish a simple kitchen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The money has since dwindled down, and the county funding is all used up, bringing organizers to a $100,000 deficit. While the infrastructure additions are a huge step up for several Isla Vistans, others are unimpressed with the community center’s finances and longevity.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We’re putting money into building a warehouse in Isla Vista,” Lanny Ebenstein, longtime I.V. resident and professor of economics at UCSB, said at a meeting during the summer. The building is functional, but Ebenstein said the concrete flooring, limited lighting and versatility will make it an inappropriate central gathering space.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“For programming to be effective, you have to have a facility that people want to use,” he said. “The project that’s coming out, it’s probably the worst I’ve seen in my years of public planning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Skip Grey, county representative for the IVCC and a member of a county ad-hoc committee, said the goal during initial construction was to build a “shell” that could be used minimally. “We had the money so we wanted to build as much as we could,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The shell has purposed small group meetings, including gatherings for teens and families who live in I.V. Paola Dela Cruz, board member for the I.V. Recreation and Park District, said these sessions have been a very constructive step up from meetings at other venues.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we’ve been trying really hard,” she said. “We need a central space that is not just for students, not just paid for by students, but for everyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVCC is working with The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) which is currently the only nonprofit servicing I.V. ventures. Together, they plan to launch a capital campaign to raise funding to make up for their current deficit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72545\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72545\" data-attachment-id=\"72545\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/comm-cen-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1328&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1328\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"comm-cen-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72545\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"Courtesy photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They have broad plans to utilize the space, including several additions that could far surpass their budget. A commercial kitchen, for example, could cost as much as $700,000. Removal of toxic adhesive underneath the current carpeting, a necessary process, will require $40,000.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flooring options, which may also become a necessity, range from $12,000 to $38,000 based on material, and wood, the most appealing option, is also the most expensive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The community center received Planning Commission approval for C-2 Zoning on Aug. 31, however, which creates much for flexibility in further plans. The zoning also puts it in the same category as business, professional and trade schools, amusement enterprises, indoor theater and non-residential child care center, among several options.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">IVCC members have ideas to bring yoga, computer literacy classes, music and dance socials, and more to a final community center, set to open in spring 2017. They hope the community center will be open 24 hours a day, but this is still a stretch for a county building that would traditionally have 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. open hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Santa Barbara County has not expressed interest in permanently managing the Community Center once it opens next year, but they will support the building in the first month of its operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Throughout the discussion, debate and redone estimates, the community organizers resoundingly agree on one common factor.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Isla Vista needs a community center.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Weekly meetings will continue until the final opening, with the next meeting held on Thursday at 6 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Community Resource Room.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Update: The latest meeting posting has been added to the article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/","id":4505,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4504,4503,4502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings On In Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"Upcoming events include Pardall Carnival and a community meeting to discuss the proposed 10 p.m. noise ordinance","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2 align=\"CENTER\">Upcoming events include Pardall Carnival and a community meeting to discuss the proposed 10 p.m. noise ordinance</h2>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center tomorrow has been cancelled due to a lack of community response. As of now, the next community center meeting will be 5 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 29 at the I.V. Clinic building. Community organizers are also planning to host a “brainstorming session” about the community center to be held on the first weekend of October.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There will be another meeting to discuss the institution of a new noise ordinance for Isla Vista 6 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 29 at the I.V. Clinic building. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office proposed in August that quiet hours be moved earlier from midnight to 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. There have already been two previous community meetings on the ordinance — one in August and one last Thursday — at which residents voiced concerns to officers of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol. Planners intend for next week’s meeting to specifically address how police officers might enforce earlier quiet hours on weekends in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The <i>Nexus</i>, KCSB and <i>The Bottom Line</i> will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Community volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters, registering as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by signing up thousands more to vote in the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The next Isla Vista Community Network will be held Thursday, Oct. 13 at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as it relates to the community. Such meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its annual Pardall Carnival on Oct. 1 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., along Pardall Road. Those attending the carnival will see tables from many of the student groups and local organizations involved on campus and in Isla Vista. IVCRC will also have a Ferris wheel on Pardall Road as well as live music from local bands. The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank will provide free food.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Isla Vista Church (IVC) will host its first Jesus Burgers of the school year Friday night at 6686 Del Playa Drive. Starting at 10 p.m., members of the church will be grilling and handing out 240 free hamburgers to partygoers. The meat for the burgers this year are the result of a donation by Goleta-based South Coast Church in partnership with Shalhoob Meat Company. According to Jason Lomelino, the pastor of IVC, the 2016-2017 school year marks the 15th year of the ministry.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday,

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Josh Ortiz, County news Editor</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Log onto Facebook and you will probably see a newsfeed full of articles or videos on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. We hear the constant drum of “Trump is a short-fingered xenophobe with an odd fixation on Skittles” or “Hillary is a lying crook but is actually dead and the woman behind the podium is actually a body double.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Believe me, I know the allure of this realm of election coverage; it can come off as ridiculous or groundbreaking or just straight-up entertaining. I am 98 percent sure that I’ve read at least one Trump-esque news article every day since the billionaire first announced his candidacy over a year ago.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just for a moment, however, let’s take our eyes off the national election coverage and take a look at the election going on right here in our own backyard, an election that can most certainly affect our lives in a direct way.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Take, for example, the historic ballot measure to raise up a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista this November. The I.V. CSD is a proposed form of local governance that will have the power to improve infrastructure and institute community policing should Measures E and F be approved by voters.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sure, a CSD has little to do with peace in the Middle East or ending Congressional gridlock. The question of approving the I.V. CSD, however, does affect whether students will be able to walk home on a well-lit street. At the same time, having a CSD also determines how much more money in taxes students pay on a monthly basis (as much as “half a Freebirds burrito every month,” according to community organizer Jonathan Abboud).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Indeed, this local election really does have its own sense of thrill; it’s the consummation of nearly two years of reporting in I.V. on my end. In this other realm of election coverage we also see the work of an influential local political party — the Santa Barbara County Democrats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">See, for example, the I.V. CSD board of director’s race. Just a few weeks ago, the local Democratic Party handed its endorsements to four candidates running for elected office in the proposed I.V. CSD — Spencer Brandt, Natalie Jordan, Ethan Bertrand and Father Jon-Stephen Hedges.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Prior to this endorsement, many of the candidates expressed the influence it would have in determining the outcome of the November election. The Democratic Party provides candidates with access to an unprecedented amount of resources: mail-in flyers, volunteer forces and cooperation with the campaigns of other local candidates and measures.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One other candidate, Andrew Gabriel Pragin, even said it would be a significant setback to not receive such an endorsement. He sought the endorsement, but was passed up by the local party officials. Now he fights what he called an “uphill battle” to get a foothold in this election, the struggle to receive the endorsement of other local political entities without the approval of the Democratic Party behind him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Look also at the race to elect the Third District County Supervisor. The two candidates vying for the position this November are Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann. The two are far from being a Hillary-Trump dichotomy, but their competition for the seat is a determining factor in Isla Vista affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Without a CSD, the Santa Barbara County is the only governing entity (other than the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District) responsible for the college town, and the Third District County Supervisor serves as the sole representative of Isla Vista on the county board of supervisors.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That being said, the Third District County Supervisor will be a large voice in the things that affect students in Isla Vista, such as the amount of policing in Isla Vista during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This upcoming school year, I encourage you to follow the local election cycle. This is the election where we can see history unfold in Isla Vista and see the face of representation change in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My personal recommendation: check in with the <i>Nexus</i> on all your local election coverage as often as you check in with Facebook on all things Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/","id":4508,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4507,4506,4505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Approval of Measure E in November will bring the CSD into existence and approval of Measure F will implement a utility user tax, allowing the CSD to improve infrastructure and institute community policing among other functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As outlined in AB 3, the CSD is to be governed by seven directors, five of whom are elected by Isla Vista voters. Four elected members are to serve four-year terms and one elected member serves for two years. For the inaugural election, however, two of the four-year seats will be two-year seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges intended to seek the Democratic endorsement early in the race. They already share the common endorsement of the Yes on E &amp; F campaign organizers Jonathan Abboud, Cameron Schunk, Darcel Elliot and Assemblymember Das Williams, who first introduced AB 3 in December 2014.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Lebell, a member of the SB Democrats’ central committee, said Wednesday it would be “no surprise” for the party to endorse the four residents. The local party has “good relations” with Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges and the Yes on E &amp; F organizers, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only other CSD candidate to seek the Democrats’ endorsement was Andrew Gabriel Pragin, whose intent was to gain the party’s backing in the competitive race for two temporary two-year positions. He is vying for a seat along with Jordan, Hedges and Michael Kile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out. They have huge resources to draw from,” Pragin said. Gaining the Democratic endorsement, he said, is also key to receiving future endorsements from “influential” organizations like the Sierra Club and the Santa Barbara Women’s Political Committee.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out.”</p>\n<p>— Andrew Gabriel Pragin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pragin and three of the four other “running mate” candidates met with local party officials Thursday at Pea Soup Andersen’s to undergo 15-minute interviews, which the party requires of candidates seeking endorsement. Jordan is currently out of town on a trip to Israel, and Elliott acted as her proxy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the meeting, Pragin said he wanted the party officials to select him for his experience and “perspective” as a local volunteer, potentially selecting him over Jordan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I honestly want them to just look at my credentials, hear what I have to say and realize that they are under no obligation to accept the top-down Das Williams endorsement as their own,” Pragin said Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not receive the endorsement, however, and will now begin what he called the “uphill fight” to seek further endorsements. Daraka Larimore-Hall, the chair of SB Democrats, said the party’s priority was to endorse candidates who “believe in Isla Vista self-governance” and will ensure the success of the CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates Jay Freeman and Kile opted not to seek the Democratic endorsement. Unopposed in his bid for one of the four-year seats, Freeman said he has had problems with “the Democratic Party establishment” in recent years despite his aligning values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kile said he is “turned off” to the Democratic Party entirely after being at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) as a Bernie Sanders delegate in July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two-party system is a system of false choice,” he said. “Being at the DNC, I got to see all of that fakeness in the Democratic Party from the highest level down.”</span></p>\n<p>The CSD board of directors candidates are running in a nonpartisan election, meaning their political affiliation will not be shown on the November ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72356\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72356\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/","id":4500,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4499,4498,4497],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joel Ruiz Suspends Candidacy for I.V.

If Isla Vistans approve Measures E and F in November, the local government will have the ability to improve infrastructure and institute community policing amongst several other functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 3 outlines that the CSD board of directors is made up of seven members, five of whom are elected at large. These five elected members are to have differing term lengths: four directors serve for four years and one director serves for two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For only the inaugural election, however, two of the four-year members will serve for just two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">declared candidacy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August, days before the filing deadline, to run against Bertrand for the single, permanent, two-year seat. An active member of VOCEROS de UCSB and a football coach at San Marcos High School, Ruiz wanted to represent Latino residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have and I will continue to be a voice for those segments of the community, especially for those who are underserved and underrepresented.” — Ethan Bertrand</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday, however, Ruiz said he joined the race unsure of his decision at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It kind of just came quick. When I filed, I was filing because I didn’t want to miss the filing deadline,” he said. “I didn’t want to have to regret not filing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to attain multiple endorsements or funds, Ruiz said he considered suspending the campaign early in the race. He said he needed the convincing of his campaign manager, Alejandra Melgoza, who sought election as Associated Students President last spring, to finally make the decision Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not someone who quits easily,” he said. “It was really hard for me to accept it, to come to terms with the reality of it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz is not the first candidate to leave the CSD race. Clark Covolo decided a week before the August filing deadline that he would drop out, opting to run for the IVRPD board instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Covolo, however, Ruiz is unable to withdraw his name from the November ballot, despite his decision to halt active campaigning. The county’s deadline to add or remove names on the ballot was Aug. 12.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Ruiz suspending his campaign, Bertrand said he will now focus more on other candidates and measures: Salud Carbajal for Congress, Joan Hartmann for Supervisor and Yes on Measures E &amp; F. He will also be promoting his CSD “running mates” Natalie Jordan, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Spencer Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he commends Ruiz for his “interest in improving Isla Vista” and will continue to advocate for the Latino community as Ruiz did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have and I will continue to be a voice for those segments of the community, especially for those who are underserved and underrepresented,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he does not yet want to throw his support behind any specific candidate, Ruiz said he is “happy” for Bertrand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sure he’ll do fine,” Ruiz said. “Hopefully he serves the community and has its best interests at heart.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates for the temporary two-year positions still face active competition. Jordan, Hedges, Michael Kile and Andrew Gabriel Pragin oppose each other for the two seats, although Jordan and Hedges consider each other running mates.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Measure F, a utility users tax, is needed along with Measure E to provide services in Isla Vista.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/","id":4628,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4627,4626,4625],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Final Candidates Join Race for Office in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ivgov.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ivgov.jpg?resize=440%2C258&ssl=1","description":"Three additional Isla Vista residents declared candidacy this week in the race to elect the inaugural members of the I.V.

Community Service District (CSD) board of directors, finalizing the ballot before the August 12 filing deadline.</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, Andrew Gabriel Pragin and Joel Ruiz declared candidacy this week. These new candidates join five other candidates— Ethan Bertrand, Stephen Brandt, Natalie Jordan, Jon-Stephen Hedges and Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the addition of these candidates, the race for the CSD board of directors was unopposed, but now numerous candidates will be running in competitive races.</p>\n<p>The CSD, a proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\">form of local government</a> for I.V., will have the power to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords if it is approved in the coming November election. It will appear as Measure E on the ballot alongside the candidates for the board of directors.</p>\n<p>As outlined in Assembly Bill 3, the recently passed legislation allowing for the CSD, the board of directors shall be made up of five members elected at large and two members appointed by the county and university.</p>\n<p>Of the five elected board members, four directors must serve four-year terms and one director serves a two-year term. Two of the four-year positions, however, have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates for the board’s first election this November.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72146\" style=\"width: 209px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1386642308\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72146\" data-attachment-id=\"72146\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"199,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72146\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/561519_4588099313791_1097245522_n.jpg?resize=199%2C300\" alt=\"Michael Kile was a prominent member of UCSB for Bernie and attended the Democratic National Convention in July.

He was involved in UCSB for Bernie and served as a delegate for Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign at the Democratic National Convention in July.</p>\n<p>He was also a part of VOCEROS de UCSB, a student organization that focuses on providing resources for Latino students, and said he hopes to represent the Latino students and families of I.V.</p>\n<p>Kile said he joined the race to contest the slate of Democrats—Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt—who <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">declared candidacy last week</a>. He wants to pose himself as an alternative to “a slate of people who will do what the county wants them to do,” he said, or at least push Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt to be “more responsive to the people of I.V.”</p>\n<p>“I dislike the idea of a full slate being pushed,” he said. “What makes me different is that I’m removed from the current network of county people or the desire to rise up in politics. I want to be here as an advocate, not as a politician.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, campaign organizer for the Yes on E &amp; F campaign, said such claims that Jordan, Hedges, Bertrand and Brandt are “in the back pocket of the county” are “patently false.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a statement made in a vacuum. Where’s the grounding or basis for that?” Schunk said. “This is a group of like-minded people who have a shared vision for Isla Vista. It has nothing to do with the county.”</p>\n<p>Pragin, who declared candidacy Friday morning, will also be running for the temporary two-year position. This is the “next logical step,” he said, since he has been a part of “the CSD conversation” for more than a year now.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66581\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"805798877\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66581\" data-attachment-id=\"66581\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447788089\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"150\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pragin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66581\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Pragin (right) discusses the CSD at a stakeholders meeting in November, 2015.

He will serve six months in Santa Barbara County Jail with five years of probation, and he may be deported to his birth country of Japan due to the nature of his conviction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The female UCSB student filed a report against Nakata to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on June 28, 2015, saying she had been sexually assaulted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nakata’s probation report, the assault occurred two days before when the woman had gone to dinner with him and several other friends. She said in the report that she had two to three beers over a period of two hours, and she and her friends then went to Nakata’s house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata poured shots for the group at his house and gave the woman one to two shots of an “unknown alcoholic beverage,” the report states. She later told law enforcement officials that she blacked out and had difficulty recalling what occurred afterward, but she remembered walking home with the defendant and three other males.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her roommates said in the report that Nakata stayed behind after the three other males left and went to the woman’s room saying that he had left his shoes there. The roommates later forgot he was still in the house and only recalled his presence when another roommate heard two people having sexual intercourse in the woman’s room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The roommates knocked on the locked door when they heard the sounds, the report states, but they did not receive any response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the woman woke up the next morning, she felt pain in her genitals and she found </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her pants in the room with the button and zipper still closed, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the report. She also stated that the amount of alcohol she consumed should not have caused her to black out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 1, the woman agreed to speak with Nakata on the phone. He apologized multiple times and said they had “hooked up for a little bit” and “it led to sex.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been weighing on me a lot because … you probably were completely blacked out later on and that was absolutely not okay to happen,” he said to her on the phone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata told her that he realized it was “definitely not okay” when, during intercourse, the woman called him by the name of another friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 2, 2015, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested Nakata at his house. He then admitted that “I did keep going for a little more” after she called him the wrong name. When asked if the woman would have engaged in sexual intercourse with him if she was completely sober, Nakata replied, “Honestly, probably no.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In light of that, I probably took advantage of the fact that you were very intoxicated, and that is what I’m very sorry for,” he told the woman during their phone call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman had known him since September 2014 and had never been in a sexual relationship with him. They were both students at the time of the assault, but Nakata dropped out of UCSB after completing his third year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wrote an apology letter to her after being arrested and his </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probation evaluation initially recommended a “low term” of three years in prison without probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the nature and the location of the offense, the defendant should be deemed a danger to young college women reaching their legal age,” the evaluation states.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was granted his final sentencing, however, after prosecutor Von Nguyen negotiated a plea deal with his defense attorney, Catherine Swyson. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said the victim’s family was very involved in the court proceedings and the victim “very much wanted to put this past her.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got to this resolution with her agreement,” Nguyen said. “Ultimately, my goal is to make sure she’s okay.”</span></p>\n<p>“I feel it was a little unfair,” said Nakata when asked about the plea deal, the probation report states. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swysen could not be reached for comment. </span></p>\n<p>Nakata was a member of the lacrosse team at UCSB and worked at software company Cielo24 at the time of his arrest. He was a resident of Northern California before he came to Santa Barbara for college.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been serving time in the Santa Barbara County Jail since June and has 54 days left on his sentence. After he is released, he will begin federal processing through United States immigration services to determine his residency status in the country.</span></p><div

Community Service District</a> (CSD) board of supervisors, which will be put to a vote in November.</p>\n<p>The CSD is a proposed form of local government in I.V. with the ability to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>It will appear as Measure E on the November ballot and require a majority vote to pass. All candidates running for office as the board of directors will be listed on the ballot, along with a tax designed to partially fund the CSD.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which outlines specific powers for the I.V. CSD, states that the board of directors will have seven members — five directors elected at large, one director appointed by the county and one director appointed by UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang.</p>\n<p>Of the five elected board members, four directors must serve four-year terms and one director serves a two-year term. For the inaugural election in November, two four-year positions have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates.</p>\n<p>Freeman, who was the first to file for candidacy, is the founder of software company Cydia and a 16-year I.V. resident. He joined the race shortly after an unsuccessful run for Santa Barbara County Supervisor in June. He and Brandt are currently unopposed as the only candidates vying for the two four-year positions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"614444030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72077\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Freeman speaks at an Isla Vista stakeholders meeting in September.

He said he is running for a four-year term, the longest term-length possible in this race, so he can “ensure that there is a precedent set for student representation and participation on the board.”</p>\n<p>Jordan, third-year history of public policy major, recently won the race for Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President. She said she offers a role on the CSD board of directors as someone who can “facilitate the partnership” between the CSD and the University.

Off-Campus Senator.</p>\n<p>“I want to bring to the table the students and residents of Isla Vista who are not often normally politically engaged,” Jordan said in an email. “They will need to be part of the solution if we want the CSD to be widely successful.”</p>\n<p>Hedges is a local pastor and volunteer chaplain for the I.V. Foot Patrol and has lived in I.V. since he first arrived in 1968 as a UCSB student. He is running for the director position because he “got drafted” by other community members, he said.</p>\n<p>“I responded favorably to that because I believe in what is being done with the Community Services District,” he said. After living in I.V. for 48 years, he said he has been in a “unique position” to have observed and been “right in the middle of” much of I.V. history.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time I have heard a strategy that really moves this community forward toward identity and a voice,” he said. “It may not have been time for [the CSD] decades ago, but it is time now.”</p>\n<p>The four new candidates will be officially registered with the county elections office after finishing paperwork due August 12, according to Hector Gonzalez-Loera, the Santa Barbara County elections supervisor. Prior to dropping out, Covolo was the only candidate that had filed completely, Gonzalez-Loera said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/","id":4627,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4626,4625,4624],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":18,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
