It may not be typical for a vigil to so quickly become political action, but it’s necessary right now,” Spencer Brandt, Community Services District board secretary, said.</p>\n<p>After a former student entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and killed 17 people with an AR-15, individuals across the country have renewed efforts for “common-sense” gun laws, including Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers,” he said in a statement released the day after the shooting.</p>\n<p>Brandt, with CSD President Ethan Bertrand and Associated Students (A.S.) External Vice President Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, organized a vigil for the Parkland shooting on Feb. 21.</p>\n<p>“[We] organized the vigil for Parkland, standing in solidarity with them because gun violence is absolutely a scourge on our country,” Brandt said. “In Isla Vista, we are inextricably linked to gun violence because of the tragedy in 2014.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand, Brandt, Labowe-Stoll, A.S. President Hieu Le and several other UC Santa Barbara students signed letters to President Trump during the vigil, urging him to pass “common-sense” gun control measures.</p>\n<p>Brandt said proposed laws, such as the one that would allow firearms to be removed from individuals in a state of crisis, is a “common-sense fix that will save lives.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Florida shooting, Carbajal, with Representatives Elizabeth Esty and Don Beyer, released a statement urging the passing of H.R. 2598, which would allow family members or law enforcement officials to petition a judge to remove firearms from an individual in crisis.</p>\n<p>“No parent should send their children to school each day wondering if they will return home. We are once again reminded that we have a responsibility to act in Congress to change things,” Carbajal said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Carbajal spoke at a UCSB Campus Democrats meeting on Feb. 20, explaining that he had first introduced H.R. 2598 in May 2017.</p>\n<p>“We have a majority Republican leadership right now … There’s very little chance for common sense gun safety laws to move forward,” he said during the meeting. “Anything that helps us create a safer country and safer communities might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Restrictions on purchasing a gun vary from state to state.</p>\n<p>In California, a person must be 18 years old to purchase a rifle or a shotgun and 21 to purchase a handgun, according to the California attorney general’s website. California law states that there must be a 10-day waiting period before the firearm can be “released” to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>The purchaser must also provide evidence of identity and age, and handgun purchasers must provide proof of California residency. “Large-capacity magazines,” or guns that accept more than 10 rounds, are illegal in California as of Jan. 1, 2000.</p>\n<p>Any person who has been convicted for a felony or has been “held involuntarily as a danger to self or others” is prohibited from buying, possessing or owning firearms or ammunition.</p>\n<p>As of Jan. 1, 2018, the kind of weapon used in the Florida shooting cannot be bought in California.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important to remember that the people leading this right now aren’t gun [control] advocacy groups … it’s the students. It’s the students in Parkland who were in the building when one of their former classmates came in with an AR-15 and starting shooting,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said the students’ response to the shooting is a “cry for help.”</p>\n<p>“They should be the ones who should be remembered as getting the momentum going if we actually get something to happen this time around,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several vigils for victims of mass shootings have been held at UCSB. The most recent one was a Nov. 7 vigil for the victims of the Sutherland, Texas shooting.</p>\n<p>“This is about gun violence in the community and seeing the leaders that in higher officials than us act responsibly. As an elected official, I’m ashamed that there are others who are acting in such a way to undermine just the basic safety of people in our country,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

a local government official questioned if the project is feasible. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sexual assault “report card” is one of 12 demands that UC Santa Barbara administrators agreed to address in May 2017 after a student sit-in. But so far, neither the university nor the local government has started to work on it.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for the university to “work with the Isla Vista Community Services District to develop a report card… for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>At a Feb. 8 town hall, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn featured the report card in a slideshow documenting the progress made on the demands. In the slideshow, the report card was listed as “in progress.”</p>\n<p>But the university did not contact I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand about the report card until Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“The CSD looks forward to working with the university on these continued efforts, but at this point there has not been a partnership on that front,” Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> after a Feb. 12 CSD meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she was under the impression that the CSD was working directly with students on the report card.</p>\n<p>“It had come up at one of the meetings that we had, where I was told that students were working directly with the CSD on that item,” Klawunn said. “I thought I was only reporting progress that was being made.” She said she did not remember who had told her or at which meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn spoke to Bertrand about the report card on Tuesday night, after the <em>Nexus </em>had inquired about the university’s progress. She said Bertrand told her that the report card is not actually feasible.</p>\n<p>“I sought Ethan out yesterday and asked him,” she said. “He said, ‘No, we can’t do it the way [Ro’Shawndra Earvin] had hoped it’d be carried out.’” Earvin led the 2017 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for documenting crime in I.V. and counting the number of meetings that have educated the community about sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Local officials will need to find a different way to create a report card, Klawunn said. She suggested creating local crime reports as an alternative. Bertrand could not be reached to elaborate on how an alternate report card would look.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

sandwiches and tater tots. Founder Dave Danhi hopes to host community events at the new store. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The store will offer a wide variety of grilled cheese sandwiches and tater tots.</p>\n<p>Founder and Chief Creative Officer Dave Danhi said that he has wanted to open up a physical location for some time and that the location in I.V. “kind of fell onto our lap.”</p>\n<p>“The [I.V.] location came to us through a friend, who actually now has become our partner because he was so happy with the concept,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>“The prior owners of the place just didn’t do well and wanted out, so they left and it became available. When I came up and looked at it, I automatically saw ourselves there,” he added.</p>\n<p>The Grilled Cheese Truck began serving Los Angeles in 2009 in a single truck. The business has since expanded to include three trucks that serve customers from Santa Barbara to Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Following the opening of the I.V. location, Danhi plans to expand truck services to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and open a second physical location in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Danhi also hopes to sell franchises in the distant future.</p>\n<p>Despite the location itself having been previously occupied by short-lived tenants such as a Korean BBQ restaurant and a burrito place, Danhi said that the universality of grilled cheese will attract customers to the store.</p>\n<p>“Grilled cheese is something that I feel everybody has a connection to, usually from their childhoods,” he said. “It’s the epitome of comfort food … so it always brings back good memories.”</p>\n<p>Danhi also noted the enthusiastic responses in I.V. he has received so far as a reason to believe in the store’s success.</p>\n<p>“As we’re setting up the location, we have people stopping by every half-hour asking if they can order already,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>He plans on getting the community involved in various ways, such as holding a variety of contests and special events.</p>\n<p>“We had our first training session recently, and some of the kids had some great ideas for special nights that we might do, like Pajama Night or Greek Night,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>Other proposed ideas Danhi mentioned include featuring a sandwich made by a customer as a special on the menu and naming the sandwich after them.</p>\n<p>He also wants to hold fundraisers and raise awareness for different causes for the clubs and organizations of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The new store will be located at 956 Embarcadero del Norte.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 22, 2018 iissue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-80577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Public Health Department warns that water in several areas may still be contaminated with bacteria.<br>Residents should avoid closed areas of coastline and thoroughly cook recreationally caught seafood. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The various coliforms and bacteria measured have remained at staggering levels above state standards. As of Monday, Goleta Beach has fecal coliform levels that are 150 percent over state standards and enterococcus levels at over 10,000 percent. Fecal coliform and enterococcus are types of bacteria.</p>\n<p>While eight beaches were closed initially, only Carpinteria State Beach, Goleta Beach and Hammond’s Beach remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department warns against going into affected waters, citing high levels of bacteria which could indicate that other disease-causing bacteria are present.</p>\n<p>The department will continue to conduct testing on Goleta Beach and other areas, but for now it recommends remaining 400 feet away from beach areas where mud transports are temporarily deposited. The buffer zone is marked by orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Elevated levels of bacteria in ocean water were first seen after Santa Barbara County began moving mud from Highway 101 to local beaches.</p>\n<p>Mud and soil runoff from the storms following the Thomas Fire in early December were collected and then transported by county flood control officials to make room for road repairs. Goleta Beach was selected as a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/mud-from-landslides-moved-to-goleta-beach-tested-for-safety/\">temporary storage site</a> for this policy.</p>\n<p>The mud dumping largely contributed to the rise in contaminant levels along surrounding areas due to the “unknown amounts of untreated sewage and possible chemical contaminants in the water and sand,” said Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of Santa Barbara’s Public Health Department.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Public Health Department issued a release warning the public to “refrain from eating recreationally raw fish and shellfish where levels of bacteria highly exceed standards.” Individuals should cook “recreationally caught” seafood before consuming it, the department said in the release.</p>\n<p>Goleta Beach is one of the areas cited in the release.</p>\n<p>Campus Point remains open due to acceptable water conditions, county officials said, as coliform levels are stable and only enterococcus bacteria exists in the water. These conditions, however, could fluctuate for as long as mud is being brought to Goleta Beach.</p>\n<p>“Bacteria concentrations at Campus Point will likely be a function of currents and winds that bring the sediment plume from Goleta Beach to Campus Point,” explained Jenna Driscoll, an associate for Santa Barbara Channelkeeper.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Channelkeeper is conducting water soil tests for <em>E.Coli</em>, fecal coliform and other biological contaminants that could seriously affect beachgoers at these locations.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department is also testing the water. Updated data can be found on the Public Health Department and SBCK websites.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 1 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Jenna Driscoll’s name was mistakingly written as “Jenny,” due to an editing error. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80738\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80738\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/","id":4344,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[4343,4342,4341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Lieutenant to Head Up Isla Vista Foot Patrol","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/camarena.jpg?resize=233%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/camarena.jpg?resize=233%2C300&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) is now led by a new station lieutenant, who took over the position this week after the departure of Lt.

His transfer was part of a regular SBSO rotational schedule, under which officers serve for about two years in a division before rotating to another job.</p>\n<p>This won’t be the first time Camarena will serve in I.V., as he worked brief stints with the IVFP while he was a sheriff’s deputy in the late 2000s. He noted that I.V. today has a far less populous weekend party scene, crediting his predecessors for “making things safer” for the community.</p>\n<p>Born in Mexico to migrant field workers, Camarena is a first-language Spanish speaker, reader and writer. He joined the Marines out of high school before starting at the SBSO.</p>\n<p>Camarena said he will open his doors to both UC Santa Barbara students and I.V.’s robust Spanish-speaking population. While he’s getting settled into the job and familiarizing himself with the neighborhood, he said he will work to police by the “golden rule.”</p>\n<p>“Using just the simple values I learned from my parents will open the doors for me to address the community and build that trust,” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents in the past year have reacted strongly to reports of burglaries and sexual assaults.</p>\n<p>In May, Cintron attended an I.V. Community Services District Town Hall to address resident concerns directly. Camarena emphasized his own commitment to preventing assaults from occurring. While law enforcement won’t have all the answers, he said, a unified I.V. might be a step toward solution.</p>\n<p>“Little by little, I’m trying to introduce myself to the different communities so we can see what we in law enforcement and the community need to do to find that fair balance, so I.V. will be a safe place to live, to work in and visit,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron, by the numbers </strong></p>\n<p>Since Cintron came onto the IVFP in March 2016, crime rates have roughly improved in the neighborhood over a two-year period, according to statistics provided by SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>There were 190 burglaries in I.V in 2015, 196 in 2016 and 106 in 2017 through Nov. 29.</p>\n<p>When it comes to simple and aggravated assault, the numbers fluctuated.</p>\n<p>Between July 2015 and June 2016 there were 181 simple assaults, while between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 149.</p>\n<p>There were 35 aggravated assaults between July 2015 and June 2016 and 37 between July 2016 and June 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron reflects on achievements, challenges</strong></p>\n<p>Cintron, who took up the post of station lieutenant in March 2016, said he believes he helped I.V. continue a “trajectory toward the better” during his time.</p>\n<p>“I fully embraced and engaged with the community,” he said. His proudest efforts were put toward preserving community safety and reducing police presence during Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement presence decreased under Cintron’s watch, alongside a decline in crime. During the four-day period through Halloween 2016, the IVFP stationed nearly 300 officers. Less than 100 IVFP officers patrolled the streets during the same period in 2017.</p>\n<p>Cintron’s tenure didn’t go without controversy. A proposed noise ordinance in Oct. 2016 threatened to scale existing “no-loud-music” restrictions from midnight back to 10 p.m. on weekend nights. A sizable community response, comprised mostly of UCSB students, railed against the proposition. The IVFP promptly <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-17/foot-patrol-postpones-noise-ordinance-change-in-response-to-community-pushback/\">delayed</a> and later nixed the plan.<br>\nCintron maintains that the noise ordinance was never his idea; before he’d arrived, the IVFP was “constantly” receiving noise complaints and Cintron was told to finish the job, he said.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, the community has made things easier for him, he said, which will, in turn, make things easier for Camarena, whom he called “very open-minded.”</p>\n<p>Nearing 30 years on the job at the SBSO, Cintron’s stint in I.V. will likely be the penultimate leg of his career.</p>\n<p>“It was a challenge, but I learned a lot,” he said. “A lot of different ideas from different people. It was a good time. A good two years.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-74749\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Children at IVYP’s Children Center are relaxing on the carpet. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I am so excited to be selected as the new ED for IVYP,” Goodman said in an email. “I strongly believe that investing in children, providing them with all [they] need to learn, to be emotionally secure and to be successful is the best investment we can make as a society.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s assignment will begin Jan. 28, following the retirement of Executive Director LuAnn Miller after 30 years of work. The organization itself was founded in 1971 by community members after riotous protests that resulted in the burning of the Bank of America in I.V.</p>\n<p>Goodman said that she wants to expand on Miller’s legacy. She described Miller as an “authentic, caring and competent leader” who grew the IVYP “from a small child care center to the diverse and impactful organization it is today.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s optimism reflects her passion for the program. She said that her main goal currently is to learn everything about the IVYP, from her duties to the people, programs and partners that surround the agency.</p>\n<p>She explained that one of the major challenges she expects to face during her first few months is funding, as with many nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>“Most of IVYP’s budget comes through the California State Department of Education,” she said. “I have a lot to learn about how that funding works, but my experience with governmental funding is that it rarely pays enough to provide the salary and benefits that teachers deserve.”</p>\n<p>She also described IVYP’s relationship to UCSB as “unique” especially as an increase in UCSB admission rates will affect housing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As UCSB moves forward in its plan to enroll more students, that will likely impact housing and services in Isla Vista. Anticipating those changes and ensuring that children and families are not forgotten will be part of my agenda,” she said.</p>\n<p>In the future, she wants to focus on spreading awareness about IVYP and its comprehensive role both in and out of the community.</p>\n<p>“More people should know what we’re doing. We serve children and families in I.V. and Goleta, but our leadership can and should be recognized far and wide,” she said.</p>\n<p>As Miller prepares to conclude her long career at IVYP, she remains grateful for the ability to have genuinely enjoyed every day of work over a span of 33 years. She began at IVYP as a teacher and assumed the role of executive director a year later.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been blessed with the perfect intersection of education, skill set, passion and faith: the ability to do meaningful work to make a difference in our community,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>The next stages in Miller’s life include plans for traveling, cooking, focusing on her health and enjoying time with her husband.</p>\n<p>“I hope I will be remembered as someone who led with heart and head,” she said. “Someone who believed that all the children and families deserve equal access to education, safety, health and respect… someone who truly enjoyed the energy, vibrancy and goodness in Isla Vista that is often missed up those outside the community.”</p>\n<p>Miller hopes that Goodman will fall in love with IVYP.</p>\n<p>“At IVYP, we are working to address the root causes of so many societal problems. When we have strong, whole children and families, our community thrives. What could be more important than that?” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Goodman is also no stranger to community service. She previously worked at Child Abuse Listening &amp; Mediation (C.A.L.M.), where she served as chief development officer and as a member of the senior management team.</p>\n<p>She has also previously worked as a camp counselor, program director, day care monitor, teacherand youth group advisor.</p>\n<p>Goodman has a deep connection with the I.V. community through her tight-knit family. Her son attends UCSB and her husband, Rabbi Evan Goodman, serves the campus through Santa Barbara Hillel. With the new gig, Goodman joked, she can now meet with her spouse for lunch at Freebirds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily

Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

contained to I.V. He hopes to later open a permanent location, but for now frequents street corners in Isla Vista. Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho needs to provide proof of insurance to resume selling on campus, according to the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL has recommended an insurance provider and has contacted Camacho to ask about his progress towards meeting the school’s requirements.</p>\n<p>The insurance required by the university needs to cover up to $2 million in liability, which is a monthly payment Camacho says he cannot afford.</p>\n<p>Days before Fall Quarter began, Camacho learned that he and other off-campus vendors would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">no longer be allowed</a> to sell on campus because the vendors’ sales violate Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding vendors unaffiliated with the university.</p>\n<p>OSL<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/elotero-could-return-to-srb-soon-pending-permits/\"> later clarified</a> the requirements needed for off-campus vendors to sell on campus. Camacho explained, however, that he would not be returning to the campus because the costs of the required permits and insurance would outweigh the benefits of selling one day of the month or even one day out of the week.</p>\n<p>Camacho sold in Isla Vista throughout Fall Quarter, even while Santa Barbara was under “hazardous” air quality due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> during December.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cuando tengo contracto con los estudiantes tengo que venir, sea lluvia o calor.</em>”</p>\n<p>“When I have a contract with the students, I have an obligation to come, rain or shine,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho situates his canopy on Pardall Road and alternates between Isla Vista street corners, where the traffic provides more opportunity for sales.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"977929887\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80442\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80412\" data-attachment-id=\"80412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/hijinio-by-stephan-manga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1274&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1274\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hijinio by Stephan Manga ONLINE-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-80412\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1-1024x652.jpg?resize=888%2C565\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho’s business is currently registered as a business within California, and he is in the process of finalizing the permits that would allow him to sell on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>County regulations require temporary food facilities to provide a cleaning station, use only prepackaged foods and clearly display permits and other paperwork. Camacho’s business meets all these requirements, and he has also been assigned a county inspector he can contact if there is a problem regarding his sales.</p>\n<p>Camacho will still participate in fundraisers with campus organizations in Isla Vista, he said. The organizations still earn 15 percent of the sales as they did when fundraising events were held on campus.

There were fundraising events every day except on Fridays between Nov. 27 and Dec. 7, Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho also expressed interest in expanding his business and clientele. He said he hopes to expand his fundraising services to student organizations from other campuses. He is also working towards a permanent location in I.V. for his business, Camacho Fruits.</p>\n<p>“<em>Eso es mi meta, trabajar con los estudiantes para que tengan un ingreso.

restricting access to Isla Vista for product distributors based in southern California.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Food Cooperative, Hana Kitchen, Woodstock’s Pizza and other restaurants in I.V. are making menu changes as products are arriving late or not at all due to distributors using an alternate route on Interstate 5. This route involves circling back south toward I.V. from northern Santa Barbara County and takes hours longer than usual.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had produce delivered six hours late because they had to go all the way around,” Woodstock’s manager Cristy Wiebelhaus said.</p>\n<p>Sam’s To Go was forced to source produce from local vendors, and the restaurant’s meat distributors are using the longer route to make their deliveries.</p>\n<p>Representatives from Naan Stop, Pizza My Heart and Hana Kitchen told the <em>Nexus</em> they are also experiencing late deliveries.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen is currently not serving vegan bowls due to limited deliveries of ingredients. The restaurant only recently received their beef shipment. In addition, only mini bowls will be available until the restaurant receives a shipment of regular-sized boxes, allowing them to resume selling regular bowls.</p>\n<p>Lao Wang, which recently relocated from Goleta to Isla Vista in early 2017, is experiencing a beer shortage because certain vendors halted distribution after the highway closure.</p>\n<p>Caje, which sources its bagels from Jack’s Bagels in Carpinteria, has also encountered its own shortage.</p>\n<p>Caje general manager Troy Yamasaki told the <em>Nexus</em> that the restaurant has stopped selling bagels, as the cafe currently has a shortage of at least one-third of its bakery items.</p>\n<p>Caje will also temporarily not serve orange juice or use it as an ingredient, since their southern-California-based orange distributor is unable to make deliveries.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying, and we’re adjusting.” said Yamasaki. “More people are ordering our avocado toast, so we might see more permanent changes to our menu.”</p>\n<p>The I.V. Co-op has faced “substantial” problems, according to merchandising manager Steve Snyder.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80422\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1012326101\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80422\" data-attachment-id=\"80422\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/mudslides-shut-down-101-local-businesses-suffering/iv-businesses-by-kaitlyn-nguyen-online-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=2000%2C1258&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1258\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Businesses by Kaitlyn Nguyen ONLINE-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=250%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=888%2C558&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-80422\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5-1024x644.jpg?resize=888%2C558\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=250%2C157&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=768%2C483&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Businesses-by-Kaitlyn-Nguyen-ONLINE-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kaitlyn Nguyen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“Customers took notice last week when we had a lot of empty shelves,” Snyder said. He also mentioned that the Co-op is unable to get produce from vendors south of the closure.</p>\n<p>Fresh produce, frozen goods and chilled foods were all late in reaching the store. The Co-op is receiving produce from Goleta and Gaviota to compensate.</p>\n<p>Supply for fresh ready-made food like burritos and wraps is already low, and the products have short shelf lives, Snyder said. The low quantity of supply makes refrigerated truck deliveries via alternate routes unjustifiable.</p>\n<p>Highway 33, which was previously used as a detour around the closure, will also be closed for three more weeks.</p>\n<p>Caltrans is expecting route 101 to open the week of Jan. 22, but no exact date has been announced.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print
