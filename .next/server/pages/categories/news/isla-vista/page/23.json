Other activities throughout the event included a butterfly exhibit, a bounce house and a soccer game with police. Various businesses throughout I.V. offered flyer coupons to Meet Your Neighbors Day attendees.</p>\n<p>The new community center on Embarcadero del Mar opened Oct. 17, serving as an art exhibition for the day. The center displayed photographs, paintings and sculptures as well as a stage for an open mic session, a zumba class and yoga.</p>\n<p>Curator for the art exhibition and third-year art major Robert Perez said opening the Community Center on Meet Your Neighbors Day was beneficial for both events to attract a large crowd.</p>\n<p>“We want to attract as many people as possible to every event,” Perez said. “There’s so much going on today, there’s stages out in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and everywhere, so we thought it made sense to unify everything under Meet Your Neighbor Day.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Aaron Howard said he showcased seven of his photographs of I.V. in the day-long art gallery at the community center.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it’s a good way to bring people together and expose people’s work,” Howard said.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Taylor Nguyen said she appreciates the art exhibited being part of Meet Your Neighbors Day.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to see the artistic side of the community. I think that is something that is not always highlighted at events, but to see student artwork has been really impressive,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematics major Gabriel Pragin said he helped organize Meet Your Neighbors Day and the community center launch. According to Pragin, it is very rewarding to see the event come together and I.V. residents enjoying themselves in the parks.</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to get us all to work together and be friends and meet each other in parks and have a good time listening to music, looking at art,” Pragin said. “It’s a way to get together and just be a community and support each other and have fun together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna and intern with the Christian organization Real Life Samantha Urena said Meet Your Neighbors Day is a good opportunity to develop stronger relationships within the community.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] create[s] more of a community of respect and compassion and bonding over having some fun on a Saturday afternoon, not just getting drunk and making more acquaintances, but actually becoming friends with some people,” Urena said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major Philip Griffin said he enjoyed listening to music and being outdoors during the all-day event.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] is a really important event,” Griffin said. “It’s such a small town and we’re all so close it would be nice to have some more events that really unify everyone and create an overall sense of unity and friendship and trust.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/","id":4645,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[4644,4643,4642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Launch Held for New I.V.

At Saturday’s launch event, participants shared ideas and recommendations for the community center’s role and services. The center is set to be complete spring 2017.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are “extremely enthusiastic” about the project.</p>\n<p>“They have formed committees to work on different aspects of it,” Farr said. “We are certainly encouraging their participation and input into all faces of it. My mantra has just been that we really want to keep the project moving forward and as on budget and on time as possible.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said the community center launched after decades of inactivity due to support from the county.</p>\n<p>“I think [the community center] has to do with the opportunity that the county has given us to actually own — for the community to own — this building,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said another reason for the project’s increased momentum is a community response to challenges I.V. has recently faced.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, I think it also has to do with other events that have happened in our community which have raised awareness about the issues that we have here,” Dela Cruz said. “We do need county resources, we do need the university to invest money, we do need residents to take ownership.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Sue Whisenand said she hopes I.V. residents of all ages and backgrounds use the community center for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>“For me, I see it being multigenerational,” Whisenand said. “I see it being a place where we have food events that help with building good nutrition and eating habits, and I see places where we can have different shows, and I see a pleasant place where maybe there are some parenting classes.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdock also said she wants the center to serve all I.V. communities.</p>\n<p>“I envision it as a location for flexible activities where various groups can request use of the building, and I hope it is used for residents, students and all age groups,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she was happy to see people come together to celebrate the project’s launch and show interest in its progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad to see that throughout this process different communities have been able to come together and to talk,” Dela Cruz said. “At the beginning I think it is difficult because we all have different ideas and perspectives … but it’s nice to just see, look at this, we did it together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fire Engine 11, which was staffed with one Captain, one Paramedic/Engineer and one Paramedic/Firefighter, was dispatched and responded from their station located at 6901 Frey Way (at Storke Rd.) in Goleta. Upon arrival, Firefighters were met by several agitated bystanders stating that the subject had cut his arm and needed help. Firefighters donned the appropriate protective equipment and approached the subject, where they found a combative male victim, around 20 years of age, being restrained on the ground by Sheriff’s Deputies who had arrived on scene prior to our arrival.</p>\n<p>Our Captain and Engineer assisted with restraining the subject, who was extremely combative, while the Paramedic/Firefighter began treatment and worked to control the bleeding. An American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance arrived on scene. The subject was placed onto a back board and restrained with soft restraints to prevent further injury to himself or to first responders. He was then transferred to the AMR ambulance and transported without delay to Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Our Firefighter/Paramedic rode to the hospital in the ambulance to assist with patient care. The Captain and Engineer remained on scene, at the request of Sheriff’s Deputies, to assist with cleanup at three different locations on Abrego Road. There was a large amount of blood on the street at these locations, which presented a biological hazard. The areas were cleaned with the use of Septisol and copious amounts of water.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Firefighters pride themselves in their professionalism while working with law enforcement and AMR to provide the highest standard of patient care. Our members treat every emergency with urgency and professionalism. Engine 11’s crew on October 11<sup>th</sup> included an experienced team of Firefighters and Paramedics. Every effort was made to provide the very best care and life saving measures for this young man.”</p>\n<p><em>For the original allegations:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/","id":4638,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4637,4636,4635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Halloween Parking Restrictions and Noise Ordinances Discussed at City of Goleta Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The City of Goleta hosted a community meeting to discuss residential parking permits and noise ordinances for Halloween weekend in Isla Vista Thursday evening at Goleta City Hall.

Neighborhood Service Department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta will implement a parking restriction from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Oct. 30 to Nov. 2, with restrictions on parts of Del Playa, Sabado Tarde, Trigo, Camino Del Sur, Camino Pescadero and El Embarcadero starting at 5 p.m. on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, UCSB will offer discounted campus parking permits for those who wish to purchase one in preparation for Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What they’ve done to mitigate the problem with students living on Del Playa is that they’ve offered the students an opportunity to buy night weekend permits at a reduced rate, so they actually get a permit they can use for the rest of the year,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino said a noise ordinance will help ensure parties to not reach unmanageable levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been studies done that show that the sooner you shut down the music the sooner the party is over,” Plastino said. “As you close that gap between the times you allow it to the time you shut it down, you lessen the amount of drunken violence and fights that break out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, the parking permit program and noise ordinance are intended to make Halloween a local event for I.V. residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this has been very successful at doing is instead of creating large, open parties with two, three or five hundred people showing up and music blasting, it’s now smaller contained parties, local parties, where students are having parties with just their friends, smaller groups, hence less alcohol, less problems,” Signa said. “By keeping it local it stays contained.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Butch Arnoldi said many people who visit I.V. for Halloween do not respect the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately people that are not from the area come up here and think that’s it free game for all kinds of assaults, physical assaults and sexual assaults,” Arnoldi said. “This is not the old west, people can’t come here from out of town and brutalize our people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said approximately 200 law enforcement officials will patrol I.V. during Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement for Isla Vista is going to consist of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s department, UCSB police department and we’re each going to have different areas that we’re going to be patrolling,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Director Vytautas “Vyto” Adomaitis said the City of Goleta developed a parking permit program with community input and has received “overwhelming support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the feedback we got from the residents was, in fact, to do something about having permit parking in the area to help keep all of the outside visitors who come into the neighborhood and flood the area with vehicles,” Adomaitis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adomaitis said the City of Goleta will keep working to decrease the impact of Halloween weekend in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ll be reviewing these measures periodically and methodically like we do after every event,” Adomaitis said. “We find out what went wrong, what needs to be adjusted.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div

Senate meeting on Wednesday, alleging emergency personnel mishandled the events leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>Hoover released the following statement regarding the events of Sunday morning:</p>\n<p>“On 10/11/2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., SBSO Dispatch received a call for medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road for a report of a male subject bleeding from the arm and running around in the street screaming for help. SBSO Deputies, Fire, and AMR responded to assist.</p>\n<p>The victim, Andres Sanchez, suffered from a large laceration around his right arm, near the elbow.  The injury was later determined to have been caused by the victim punching his arm through a plate glass window.  Sanchez was combative and displayed symptomology of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Sanchez was restrained on a backboard and transported to Cottage Hospital Emergency Room by ambulance. Based on witness statements at the scene, Sanchez had struck the apartment window with his right arm and began running around, yelling and acting strangely.  He was bleeding profusely. Several of the witnesses attempted to restrain Sanchez and provide first aid. Sanchez’s roommate believed Sanchez may have ingested some type of synthetic drug, possibly LSD or K2.</p>\n<p>While at Cottage Hospital, Sanchez became unresponsive.  Advanced life-saving efforts were attempted, but were unsuccessful.  Sanchez was pronounced dead at approximately 6:51 a.m.  Next of kin was notified by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Emergency Room staff. The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is conducting a death investigation to determine cause and manner of death.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said fire and medics were dispatched “within seconds” of Melgoza’s 911 call, and deputies arrived within three and a half minutes.</p>\n<p>“I was able to pull up the dispatch log and I can see exactly when the call came in and when it was given to fire and medics,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses’ claims that a translation service was not available following the incident is “totally false,” and deputies do not notify families of tragedies by phone.</p>\n<p>“Foot Patrol has many translators. We have staff and we have deputies that speak Spanish,” Plastino said. “We would never call someone on the phone … we call down to the agency that’s in charge of that area.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he wants to provide “100 percent transparency” regarding the events preceding Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“I am so absolutely positive that we did everything absolutely right,” Plastino said. “I want everything to go to the press because I feel so confident in how we handled this.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said deputies’ demeanor on scene is often misconstrued as harsh.</p>\n<p>“At the moment of the crisis we are the ones that have to do the job, and in order to do that, you have to put up your brick wall … your mental armor to deal with the situation at hand,” Plastino said. “That can come across to some people as being uncaring, unfeeling, unemotional, unsympathetic at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said although he does not agree with Ariana, Baker, Hernandez, Melgoza and Ramirez, he thinks they are asking “good questions.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely 100 percent glad that they are asking these questions, that they are questioning the way things are being done, because things aren’t always being done the way they should be,” Plastino said. “In this incident, I disagree with their perception of things.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses alluded to false events, causing Sanchez’s family “unwarranted grief.”</p>\n<p>“I could care less all day long if they want to question law enforcement,” Plastino said, “but when it affects the family and their grieving process for their son who’s died, then it’s an exception, because it causes them more grief.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, deputies are trained in basic first aid, but are not equipped to handle severe injuries.</p>\n<p>“The first aid kit that we carry is enough to help somebody with a stubbed toe, like a small cut,” Plastino said. “We’re trained in basic first aid, which is something anybody can go get … but it’s not advanced life support … we can apply pressure, we can do CPR.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said it is “frustrating” for deputies to be first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency because they do not have the means to provide the care needed.</p>\n<p>“We want to assist, but we’re powerless because we don’t have the skills, the equipment or everything else that needs to be done during a major incident like that,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he agrees with the witnesses that all police vehicles should contain an emergency kit.</p>\n<p>“Here is where we need to do a better job — there was a criticism that we did not carry a first aid kit,” Platino said. “That’s gonna be addressed … Every single one of [our] cars needs to have a first aid kit.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, one of the two IVFP deputies who responded had a flashlight when approaching Sanchez, but the allegation that a deputy carried a baton is “absolutely untrue.”</p>\n<p>“One of them got out with a flashlight, and the flashlights are not very big, so I don’t know how that could have been construed as a baton. The batons are long,” Plastino said. “That flashlight was never used in any way to restrain the young man, it was never used against anybody that was a bystander. It wasn’t used at all.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is “very impressed” with the witnesses’ response when Sanchez approached them.</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who was assisting, trying to keep him down, because he was trying to get up,” Plastino said. “Hats off to those who assisted him because with blood loss, the more worked up you are, the more blood you can lose. They were absolutely doing the best job they could as bystanders.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the deputies’ behavior alleged in the witnesses’ accounts can “not be tolerated,” and he asks for evidence that such misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p>“Whoever is propagating that kind of nonsense, I would ask them to come forward and provide proof of it,” Plastino said. “If there is proof of it, we need to have a full-blown investigation.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, officers will meet with the Sanchez family today to ensure the two deputies did everything in their power when addressing the situation.</p>\n<p>“The sheriff is meeting actually with the family today and going to show them everything so that they can rest assured that we handled their son properly,” Plastino said, “that he was not mistreated in any way, that no part of this was mistreatment of their son.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Correction: This article previously stated San Diego deputies notified the Sanchez family of Andres Sanchez’s death; however, it was Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital that did so.

Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students.

She says she was motivated to retire so she could spend more time with family.</em> Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr announced Friday she will not seek a third term after December 2016.</p>\n<p>Farr has served on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors since 2009, representing Santa Ynez, Goleta and Isla Vista. While in office, Farr secured $480,000 of county funding for an I.V. Community Center and $10.3 million for the Pescadero Lofts, which provide housing and services for I.V.’s houseless population. Farr has also supported Assemblymember Das Williams’ recently signed Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which will create Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. if approved by residents.</p>\n<p>Farr said she decided to end her time in office because she is feeling “the pull of family.”</p>\n<p>“My sister passed away in the spring. She was my only sibling. She was four years younger than I was. That was a real blow and continues to be a real blow,” Farr said. “My mother — now I’m the only child she has and she’s 88 years old, and also since I’ve been in office, I’ve had two grandchildren born.”</p>\n<p>Farr said she originally ran for office in 2008 because colleagues told her she was apt for the position.</p>\n<p>“I got to thinking about it, and I thought, well, maybe I do have a unique background … I obviously didn’t know whether I’d be elected or not,” Farr said. “I’d never run for any public office before, and so that was quite an experience.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career began when she presented a proposal to the Board of Supervisors to build sidewalks and stop signs in the then unincorporated area of Goleta. According to Farr, she then led two different neighborhood community groups, one in Goleta and one later in the Santa Ynez Valley. She then became Second District Planning Commissioner of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I’ve lived in the county for almost four decades now, first in the south coast and now in the Santa Ynez Valley, kind of gave me a unique background,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr says one of her “legacies to the district” will be securing funding to open the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s certainly a project that is personally close to my heart, and I’m glad that we were able to keep going and secure the funding,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Farr’s support for AB 3 in her role as Chair of Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a state-mandated agency that typically oversees the development of CSDs, was essential to the development and progress of the bill.</p>\n<p>“She came to Sacramento to testify during our first committee hearing and was able to effectively attest to the real challenges of Isla Vista in their quest for self-governance,” Williams said in an email. “Also, as chair of LAFCO during this process, Supervisor Farr has been a voice of reason, encouraging a compromise where LAFCO could be involved in the formation of the CSD while understanding why the community wouldn’t want to leave it totally in their hands.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who has worked with Farr since she assumed office, said Farr is a “consummate professional.”</p>\n<p>“She’s always extremely well-prepared, and she and I don’t agree on everything, but I’ve always respected her positions. She’s always had a very well-thought-out position, and I’m really going to miss working with her,” Lavagnino said. “I haven’t heard of anybody who’s talking about running, but it is absolutely the most difficult district in the five to represent … she’s got a very difficult job and I think she’s done extremely well.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of External Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said she has worked with Farr on a number of projects, including the recent appointment of Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr managed to get funding for our community service deputy — [I believe] that was $114,000,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, Farr’s work in support of AB 3 will not come to fruition without sufficient funding for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I totally support self-governance for Isla Vista,” Lavagnino said. “The problem is if you don’t have a funding stream to handle that — I don’t think that the students understand exactly how much it costs to provide sidewalks and those kinds of things that supervisor Farr’s been working diligently on for the last years.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she appreciates that Farr has made significant contributions to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am really proud and honored to have been able to work with her, and I think all of our community is thankful for the amount of work she’s put into Isla Vista, the amount of money that she’s been able to get for our community,” Dela Cruz said. “The last thing I’d like to say to her is just thank you, thank you for your hard work.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career has been rewarding, but she is grateful for the opportunity she now has to spend time with her family.</p>\n<p>“When you get into your 60s and your friends are starting to retire and you just start thinking that there are other things that are important to do,” Farr said. “Being the Third District County Supervisor is absolutely an incredible job [and] opportunity — it’s an honor and a privilege every day to have been chosen by the voters to do this very important work that shapes county policy, [and] shapes land use.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 10 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday night to give witness testimonials of the events leading up to the death of second-year pre-biology major Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:40 a.m., two Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help. Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm.</p>\n<p>The five students, Areli Ariana, Ashley Baker, Jocelin Hernandez, Alejandra Melgoza and Marvin Ramirez, dialed 911 following an encounter with Sanchez near their residence. According to the students, first responders on the scene mishandled the situation, mistreating the victim and witnesses based on their race.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said Sanchez ran up to him and Hernandez screaming “help!” while bleeding profusely from his right arm.</p>\n<p>“He, like, ran into my arms and I didn’t even have a shirt on, and I felt him and he had a massive cut in his right arm and it was just gushing out blood, and it wasn’t dripping, it was literally flying and it was ridiculous,” Ramirez said. “I knew at the time that it was a matter of time, and we ran inside and tried to get a towel and we tried to take care of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez was restless but was not violent toward the five witnesses.</p>\n<p>“He was a little bit out of control due to the adrenaline, so he was running around from one apartment complex to another, but we attempted to stop him. We sat him down several times,” Ramirez said. “Though it seemed like he was violent, he didn’t do anything to us.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said she spoke with dispatch and “specifically requested” medical assistance, but was not taken seriously.</p>\n<p>“I was the one who called dispatch and dispatch didn’t believe me,” Melgoza said. “When you have anyone who is pleading for help, saying that there is blood gushing out of a wound — when you have someone who is passed out in front of your doorstep with blood gushing out of a wound, I would expect dispatch to hear the screaming in the background.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and psychology double-major Areli Ariana said EMTs and paramedics who responded to the call displayed a lack of urgency.</p>\n<p>“They literally acted like it was an inconvenience for them to do their job,” Ariana said. “We were yelling at them, and yes we were frantic, but who wouldn’t be if they were covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, emergency personnel took a long time to arrive, and police officers and firefighters did not act urgently upon arriving at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I was jumping in front of them and just full of blood and telling them to hurry up and they just walked out of the car,” Ramirez said. “When the firefighters got there they didn’t want to get blood on their suit, and I remember Jocelin screaming at them, ‘If I have blood on me, why can’t you get blood on you! Hurry up, we don’t have time!’”</p>\n<p>Ariana said responders disregarded her and other witnesses’ attempts to explain the situation, but acknowledged a white male bystander who began speaking to them after police arrived.</p>\n<p>“We’re all basically persons of color; there’s no doubt that we’re brown. He just completely bypassed everything we said,” Ariana said. “He didn’t acknowledge our presence — he didn’t recognize us. From the moment we started speaking he ignored us.”</p>\n<p>According to Ariana, the deputies who responded treated Sanchez “brutally” without reason.</p>\n<p>“While Jocelin and I were huddled over Andy, we were able to hold him down and to calm him down while the police officers came,” Ariana said. “When the police officers came, the first thing they did was to grab a baton and try to hold Andy down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major Ashley Baker said the police officers involved in Sunday night’s incident were not held accountable for their “brutal” treatment of Sanchez.</p>\n<p>“This is the third time in my life that I have witnessed one of my Latino brothers pass away and have it be completely erased the next morning,” Baker said. “Instead of having a thorough investigation they wash everything down. It was like a Hazmat — it  was like it never happened.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the officer did not have an emergency kit and approached the scene with a baton in hand.</p>\n<p>“One of the other things was that the cop didn’t have an emergency kit, so when they got out they just got out with a baton. What good are you by then?” Ramirez said. “We asked why, and they just said the car did not have it on them. That’s not an excuse because we lost a life, and you don’t know how important that is but that’s a life, a student life.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said Sanchez’s death is likely due to first responders’ misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is a fellow student of ours who probably died because of the negligence of the EMTs and the paramedics and the police officers,” Ariana said.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez’s mother was unaware of the situation the next day due to an incomplete police report, in which the witnesses who called emergency services were not included.</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand how hard it was,” Ramirez said. “And how hard it was for the mother when we saw her the next day and she had no idea about what happened because they didn’t take a thorough report and they didn’t include us in the report.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said IVFP did not have translation services available, which delayed the time it took to notify Sanchez’s family of his death.</p>\n<p>“We found out that his family didn’t speak English, so they needed a translator,” Ariana said. “He [the officer] was very insensitive to that and he did not prioritize communicating the sensitive information to Andy’s family.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said emergency responders should have access to translation, especially to Spanish.</p>\n<p>“How many Latino/Latina families are out in Isla Vista?” Melgoza said. “The fact that we don’t have translating services is a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she wants to stress the “racial dynamics and dimensions” of the law enforcement’s failure to address the situation.</p>\n<p>“It looks like two cops running in and trying to restrain the individual. And they criminalized the individual because they don’t know how to react,” Hernandez said. “They recoiled at the sight of the wound because they’re not trained, that is not somebody that is trained to ensure our safety.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the police officers did not carry out their responsibility to ensure Sanchez’s well-being.</p>\n<p>“This is a student that meant nothing to us, I’m not even getting paid to care,” Ramirez said. “If we have such urgency why don’t they do everything in their power?”</p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">“IVFP Responds to Allegations of Misconduct in Sanchez’s Death.”</a></em></p>\n<p><em>For the SBC Fire response:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Nexus<em> firmly believes in fair comment and is actively seeking comment from all agencies involved in these allegations.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus. <em>The title of this article was edited to better reflect the context in which the statements were delivered. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/","id":4640,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4639,4638,4637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brown Signs Three Bills Regarding Refugio Spill","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brown.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brown.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Governor Jerry Brown signed three bills on Oct. 8 authored by Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Das Williams in response to the May 2015 Refugio Beach Oil Spill.

According to the bill, installation of these technologies will be complete by Jan. 1, 2018, and the State Fire Marshal will have adopted the necessary regulations to effectively assess risk analysis of pipelines by July 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes more frequent pipeline inspection could have prevented the Refugio Beach Oil Spill, as many pipeline failures are largely due to damage from chemicals added to oil for faster transport.</p>\n<p>“As oil has become more viscous and more problematic, there are more corrosive chemicals being used to thin it out so it can be transported more easily, and these are having a tremendous and detrimental effect on the pipelines,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said while the three bills are a “step forward” in protecting the environment from oil spill damage, oil production still poses as threat to surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>“As long as we have oil production in environmentally sensitive areas like those in Santa Barbara County, we live under threat of damaging oil spills,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double major Nicholas Frey said the bills are only temporary solutions to the greater problem of fossil fuel dependence.</p>\n<p>“While they were good, it was just kind of putting on a little Band-Aid to a much larger problem,” Frey said. “I would’ve wanted to see more transitioning out of fossil fuels and actually removing said pipelines.”</p>\n<p>UCSB CALPIRG campus organizer Alena Simon said California needs further legislation that transitions it toward alternative energy.</p>\n<p>“I think we’d like to see California go 100 percent renewable and not actually rely on these dirty fossil fuels at all,” Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said California should seek renewable energy “as rapidly as possible.”</p>\n<p>“We can work to make pipelines safer, but as long as there is oil drilling there will be oil spills,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>EAB Co-chair and second-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said he hopes legislators continue to pass legislation to impose tighter controls on the fossil fuel industry prior to another oil spill, rather than in response.</p>\n<p>“It stinks for me that we have to have these spills before we can pass tougher legislature on oil and fossil fuel industries,” Berry said. “I’m glad to see them passed, and I think frequent checks will be better … because it’s never if a spill’s going to happen, it’s when, so hopefully they can be checked and prevented.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Included in the 10 points are proposals for the temporary seizure of guns from dangerous individuals and background checks on all gun sales. Schneider also presented the idea for a $10 billion national gun buyback program in her plans. The Santa Barbara Police Department (SBPD) held a gun buyback program the past two summers, allowing owners to return their guns for money, no questions asked.</p>\n<p>Schneider said as a result of the SBPD buybacks, hundreds of guns in the Santa Barbara area are now “off the streets.”</p>\n<p>“We could calculate 55 million guns off the street with this kind of [national] program,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said gun control is a “top priority” in light of recent mass shootings, including those at Northern Arizona University and Umpqua Community College in Oregon.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we’ve seen the very tragic events both in Isla Vista last year,” Schneider said. “Everywhere you turn, these kind of incidents happen, and as a mayor you don’t want to get that call that someone’s been shot and killed due to gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who organized a vigil to honor victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting, said he discussed the importance of gun laws with Assemblymember Das Williams in the past.</p>\n<p>“Take guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “If that’s gun control, then I’m all for it. Certain people should not have guns; that’s all.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Assembly Bill 1014, a legislation similar to Schneider’s 10th point which allows law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from a person who poses immediate danger, will only be effective if Californians know they can request a dangerous person’s weapons be removed.</p>\n<p>“Having [AB 1014] on the books is helpful but a lot of people don’t know about that,” Armbruster-Sandoval said.</p>\n<p>Owner of Dodge City Shooters Supply Rick Dodge said most of Schneider’s proposals would have little effect on his gun store because California gun laws are already some of the strictest in the country.</p>\n<p>“Most of those things don’t apply to California because we already have them,” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Dodge said while he is in favor of background checks, gun owners are prone to undeserved scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“Thirty-thousand people die in a car accident every year, so why don’t we all drive cars at 15 miles per hour with rubber tires put all the way around?” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said attention to recent mass shootings will make gun laws a prevalent topic in the upcoming 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s changing in the last couple of years especially is that general voters, democrats, republicans, gun owners, non-gun owners are saying enough is enough,” Schneider said. “This is going to be and should be a campaign issue in 2016.”</p>\n<p>Dodge said Schneider’s proposal may have an unexpected effect even if it fails to go into law.</p>\n<p>“When [politicians] talk about it … more people rush into the stores and are worried about more stringent regulations, it creates more sales for us,” Dodge said. “We always joke around: The best salesman in the world is President Obama — he mentions something and everyone around the nation rushes in to buy.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

following Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 in the interest of pursuing a model for self-governance similar to Isla Vista’s.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 proposes the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. While unincorporated areas such as I.V. and Castro Valley receive municipal services from their county, a CSD is governed by a board of local representatives that decide what services to provide to residents using local tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Traditionally CSD’s are formed through Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO), but both unincorporated areas have found that LAFCO’s model for a CSD does not fit each area’s respective needs. AB 3 bypasses LAFCO by establishing a CSD though state-level legislation. Castro Valley Matters, a group advocating for self-governance in the northern California community, have been closely following the bill, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law last week.</p>\n<p>According to Castro Valley Matters President Michael Kusiak, the group has followed AB 3 since Williams first introduced the bill to the Assembly in December 2014.</p>\n<p>“We’re kind of crazy people up in northern California who have been following what’s been happening down in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista,” Kusiak said.</p>\n<p>An I.V. CSD as outlined in AB 3 would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Kusiak said a UUT is an “innovative means” of funding self-governance in unincorporated areas, because LAFCO often rejects CSD proposals on the basis that they are not financially feasible.</p>\n<p>“Our contention is that any unincorporated community that tries to go to LAFCO at this point will be told, ‘Actually, no, you’re not fiscally viable,’” Kusiak said. “Isla Vista is really special. It’s really interesting. That’s why we at Castro Valley Matters are following it.”</p>\n<p>Castro Valley Matters Vice President Michael Baldwin said the group is interested in a “virtual town” model, which combines a CSD, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC). According to Baldwin, no area has attempted this model, but I.V. is “as close as it comes.”</p>\n<p>“I was advocating to have a ‘virtual town’ model, which is basically what you guys did — to have a CSD that covers the whole town,” Baldwin said. “Nobody has ever done all three together — no ‘virtual town’ model.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said the self-governance process in Castro Valley has been “a lot slower” than in I.V., and their few group meetings have led to participants “talking in circles.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the opposite of what’s going on down there,” Baldwin said. “You guys got together and figured something out and pushed it through.”</p>\n<p>Kusiak said AB 3 can serve as an example of local governance for unincorporated areas that are unable to attain cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think it sets a precedent not just for Castro Valley but for all unincorporated communities,” Kusiak said. “I know it only applies to Isla Vista, but it tells our state legislature that unincorporated communities can be given alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said when he called William’s office after AB 3 was introduced, staffers told him not to market the bill as a model for other unincorporated areas seeking self-governance for fear it would invite opposition.</p>\n<p>“They kind of said, ‘Oh no. Don’t publish that actually. We don’t want people to think its precedent even though it kind of is,’” Baldwin said. “They were worried that if the legislature saw it as a precedent they might not pass it.”</p>\n<p>Williams said some are “scared to death” AB 3 will pave the way for other areas to circumvent LAFCO when working toward self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that, with the opposition to AB 3, much of it was based on that it could be precedent setting,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill was specially made for I.V. and he does not intend to replace the LAFCO process throughout California.</p>\n<p>“At no time in this effort have we taken on or criticized the LAFCO process for the entire state,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said Castro Valley Matters’ support demonstrates I.V.’s role as a progressive and innovative unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>“As far as governance for an unincorporated community, it shows that our community is a very forward-thinking one,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said I.V. should support other unincorporated areas such as Castro Valley.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be important for Isla Vista to share its experience now to other communities who need that help,” Abboud said</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 only seeks approval of I.V. residents, not in the recognition of those outside the area.</p>\n<p>“The real legitimacy of the government doesn’t rest with people outside the community,” Williams said. “It rests with the people in the community making the decisions themselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

California in the coming months, bringing wet weather and the possibility of increased erosion along the cliffs of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>El Niño is a climatic change that occurs every two to seven years near the equatorial Pacific region. The 2015 El Niño has already affected climate patterns and ocean temperatures in the Pacific region. While winter weather across the country will feel the effects of El Niño, California and other Southern states in particular will experience atypical weather conditions and heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of earth sciences Alex Simms said the predicted heavy precipitation may lead to increased erosion.</p>\n<p>“There are higher rates of erosion during El Niño,” Simms said. “If you have one of those houses that is already hanging off the cliff, things are probably going to get bad for you.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of geology Charles Jones said El Niño is caused by a change in atmosphere that leads to warming waters and heavier moisture.</p>\n<p>“An El Niño is an interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially the tropical oceans,” Jones said. “It has a reoccurrence time of about two to seven years and it has a lot of natural variability.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the upcoming El Niño is predicted to be the strongest in nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>“Some forecasters think that it might be similar to the ’97, ’98 El Niño, which was the strongest El Niño on record,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and I.V. resident Molly Morrison, who last year led a campaign to install safety fences along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive, said she is concerned heavy rains may cause damage to the cliffs.</p>\n<p>“I’m not so concerned about the fences as I am about the actual cliff situation,” Morrison said. “Whether the fences can stand or not I don’t think is really the question, but whether the cliffs can.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said even without increased precipitation levels the cliffs are subject to significant erosion each year.</p>\n<p>“On average, the cliffs on this side of Isla Vista are supposed to erode about a foot a year,” Morrison said. “It will be interesting to see, if El Niño does pick up, in winds, velocity … how it will increase cliff erosion rates.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Connor Dodds said though he lives in a cliffside house on Del Playa, he is not concerned about El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be any big deal,” Dodds said. “When it’s high tide, the waves have already been hitting the cliff and it hasn’t really been doing much.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and Spanish double major Connor Kulg, Dodds’ housemate, said he looks forward to the improved surf that will come with El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Kulg said. “I’m not looking forward to the rains, but I am looking forward to the big waves.”</p>\n<p>Simms said the cliffs have been eroding for many years, and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>“This process has been going on for thousands of years, and there is nothing we can do to stop it,” Simms said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Self-Governance Bill (AB 3), which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law on Wednesday, and funding for and I.V. Community Center. AB 3 aims to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives and supported by a Utility Users Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>Farr said it will be a “big job” to educate I.V. residents about how a CSD would affect them before they vote to approve it in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people get voter fatigue; they’ve got this enormous ballot, all this stuff to go through so hopefully [AB 3] doesn’t get lost in that,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr said she has heard concerns regarding funding for CSD administrative costs and services, and the role Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) would play in a CSD.</p>\n<p>Farr said a UUT, which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills, is a more effective method of dividing the costs of the CSD between students, long-time residents and property owners.</p>\n<p>“That was why they wanted the UUT rather than a property tax because the thought was that the tax burden is spread more evenly throughout the community that benefits, and not just on those people that own property,” said Farr. “Long-term owners are concerned that they are going to be saddled with enormous tax assessments.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, IVRPD was intentionally excluded from the CSD planning.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. Park and Rec District did not want to be folded into the CSD and that was why we thought the governor might not sign it, because he doesn’t like creating layers,” Farr said. “So it was specifically written to exclude IVRPD … we’ve got a good thing going, we don’t want to goof it up.”</p>\n<p>Professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said he has plans to raise funds for an Isla Vista Community Center that involve alumni and current students.</p>\n<p>“There are 190,000 alumni at UCSB and most of them have probably lived in Isla Vista,” Ebenstein said. “Only 15,000 people live here at a time, but over twenty or thirty years, 150,000 may have lived here.”</p>\n<p>According to Ebenstein, significant funds are still needed to build a community center.</p>\n<p>“$483,000 is a start, but it is not enough to do everything that should be done,” Ebenstein said. “Our goal would be to raise a million dollars … What we are trying to do is raise a million dollars more — that would be the funds that we think would be necessary to really make the community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/","id":4630,"author":{"id":148,"name":"Jacob Little"},"related":[4629,4628,4627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Until the November 2016 voting period, studies will be conducted to determine how financially plausible this plan is.<em> Online Stock Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Governor Jerry Brown signed Assemblymember Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill, Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), into law Wednesday.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, I.V. residents will vote on the establishment of I.V. as a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives, which would determine local services and infrastructure projects. If approved by voters, the CSD would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Until November 2016 the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) will conduct an analysis of the financial feasibility of a CSD for I.V.</p>\n<p>Field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus Cameron Schunk said the next step for Williams’ staff will be to assist the Board of Supervisors and LAFCO in their feasibility study to provide reliable information for 2016 voters.</p>\n<p>“The way the bill is written, it goes to a vote regardless of what LAFCO’s analysis says,” Schunk said. “Our hope, though, is to work as closely with LAFCO as possible to get the best possible analysis, which provides usable and accurate information. This really gives voters confidence when they go to the ballot, one way or another.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, representatives from Williams’ office will continue to educate residents about the CSD in stakeholder meetings every Tuesday night in the I.V. Clinic.</p>\n<p>“As far as our Tuesday night meetings, we fleshed out a schedule of events where we will be delving deep into each of the services, fleshing out how the community would like to see them enacted, what sort of contract we would want to draw out and how much we would be looking to spend on various things,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said her office will be working to educate students about the advantages of a CSD in I.V.</p>\n<p>“A large part of this, of which the EVPLA office is going to take part, is voter education,” Dela Cruz said. “I hope to inform students of the benefits of AB 3 and also anything that might affect them.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said A.S. needs to continue providing support to the I.V. self-governance movement to ensure the success of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to support any people, power and financial resources we can to ensure that it’s a successful election and start it right,” Villarreal said. “There are people who haven’t heard [about a CSD], so we want to continue with the educational process.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, the 50-year-old movement for I.V. self-governance recently gained momentum because of support from I.V residents, the university, elected officials and other local agencies.</p>\n<p>“In the past, there were entities purposely road-blocking the efforts — LAFCO and the university were actively against those efforts and Isla Vista was powerless against these established organizations,” Abboud said. “This go around, we have a lot of allies that have really assisted us in getting this through officially.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” I.V. residents will vote in favor of a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I think that the community has had enough with the status quo,” Abboud said. “There’s a lot of energy to change the status quo and this is a chance to do so.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/","id":4663,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4662,4661,4660],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":23,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
