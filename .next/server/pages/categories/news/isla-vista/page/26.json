As part of this series, UC Santa Barbara students, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students and Goleta and Isla Vista residents attended the City Council meeting with the intent of securing a council endorsement for AB 3.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 in December 2014 to propose establishing I.V. as a community services district (CSD) to address the lack of self-governance in Isla Vista. A CSD would be funded by local taxes and improve local infrastructure and public services. The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a state-mandated agency that oversees the formation of CSDs, however the I.V. CSD would bypass the LAFCO formation process by act of the state legislature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous. – Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said establishing a CSD is necessary to address the issues facing I.V.</p>\n<p>“We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students off-campus senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said a CSD would provide residents the opportunity to voice the community’s needs and to change I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“AB 3 is the best chance we have to have Isla Visa take control of itself and in a responsible way turn things that are difficulties now into benefits, to turn the reputation of Isla Vista into a boon for the entire area,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>LAFCO commissioner and California Special Districts Association president Craig Geyer said the bill bypasses the LAFCO formation process and should not be included in the Goleta city agenda.<br>\n“The funding source is usually utility tax which is reserved for cities and counties,” Geyer said. “Speaking as a resident of Goleta, I don’t think Goleta has a stick in this fire.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward. We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this. – Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said the discussion on the financial feasibility report outlining the expenses of a CSD is unrelated to the current passage of the bill to committee. Schunk also said LAFCO “continuously misrepresents facts” regarding details of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Consistently property owners, long-term I.V. residents and other groups have been undermining the passage of the self-governance movement and AB 3,” Schunk said. “To say that AB 3 isn’t self-governance while recommending the existing power structures maintain control is not only disingenuous but also misleading.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said the LAFCO process of discussing financial aspects of a CSD is “crucial” in making the decision to endorse a bill.</p>\n<p>“At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward,” Soutar said. “We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Lanny Ebenstein said creating a CSD is a long overdue step, as shown by recent tragic events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was tragedy in many respects that led to this proposal coming forward,” Ebenstein said. “It was the clear evidence that the current government structure for Isla Vista is not working.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created. – Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch said Goleta should not partake in the CSD except to address issues of safety, such as establishing ordinances for Deltopia and Halloween weekends. According to Murdoch, these specific ordinances are county-wide and can be executed from within Goleta without the need for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created,” Murdoch said. “If I.V. was part of Goleta then specific unique ordinances could be drafted to solve these specific unique problems.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, conversations on the CSD’s financial feasibility will not be relevant for months to come and have distracted from the discussion on endorsement of the bill.</p>\n<p>“We will need the feasibility study to determine the rate of the tax but we won’t be determining the rate for maybe another year,” Abboud said. “The CSD law says you’re allowed to have a laundry list of taxes that can be specified later, it’s not important to the fast-paced process of the bill right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta City councilmember Michael T. Bennett said AB 3 is not perfect, but I.V. issues are intrinsically tied to Goleta city issues and should be supported by the council. Bennett said the effectiveness of the I.V. Recreation and Parks Department suggests a CSD that includes students and long-term residents could be successful.</p>\n<p>“I think as a beginning point it’s an opportunity for people to determine their own destiny,” Bennett said. “What gives me the most faith that it can actually work is, in fact, the Parks and Rec Department. When that was proposed there were many naysayers … but it has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectation and has shown that it can work with students and those that are residents with the community.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, committee members took a group vote to postpone the discussion to May 19 to discuss the matter with Mayor Paula Perotte, who could not attend the meeting due to sickness. The motion failed and the committee adjourned to regular meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*This is an updated version of this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63107\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63107\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/","id":4699,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4698,4697,4696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Locals Gather to Raise Awareness for the Houseless","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Houseless-Awarness-Night_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Houseless-Awarness-Night_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"“The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone.

The evening ended with long-term I.V. houseless resident Clyde performing Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” on the guitar.</p>\n<p>Hedges said while many people think of houselessness as an abstract problem, it is actually an issue made up of individuals.</p>\n<p>“They are not a population,” Hedges said. “They are persons who you can meet and know by name and by stories, not by what group they’re a part of.”</p>\n<p>Anyone can become houseless given unfavorable circumstances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>“In a blink, any one of us can become homeless,” Hedges said. “We’ve seen it happen. A house burned and that family becomes homeless. During the landslide, a lot of those folks became homeless for a while.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while nonprofit organizations need to create opportunities for houseless people, they should not try to “fix” them.</p>\n<p>“We stepped in and gave them [houseless people] a key to provide opportunity and advocacy to get their lives back together,” Hedges said. “They take it upon themselves to better their lives.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said houseless people have died in I.V. this past year, specifically his friend, Little Rick, who passed away after struggling with addiction and depression.</p>\n<p>“He ended up dying behind that … liquor store in Isla Vista,” Hedges said. “He drank himself to near death then died of hypothermia that night. He had no will to live, and it broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said people need to stop stigmatizing houselessness because it creates a “self-fulfilling” cycle.</p>\n<p>“There’s a set of characteristics homeless people have — low self-esteem, difficulty holding a job, etcetera,” Rawlings said. “If you tell them they can’t make it or they’re inferior or can’t do certain things, they will lose the motivation to try.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said society’s conceptions on homelessness do not reflect the root of the problem.</p>\n<p>“We carry in our heads bullshit of how the world really works,” Rawlings said. “What is true and what is legitimization — stories we tell ourselves that makes us feel better about the world.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said common ideas on houselessness often underestimate the influence of economic and social forces.</p>\n<p>“Poverty is seen an individual problem — people are poor because they don’t work hard. They’re not the toughest of the lot, but that’s not true,” Rawlings said. “The basis of these B.S. theories on inequality is through an overemphasis on being individuals.”</p>\n<p>Common Ground Santa Barbara Volunteer Coordinator Stephen Gruver said houselessness is much harder than perceived.</p>\n<p>“You end up filling out dozens of paperwork to apply for anything, and people say homeless people are just getting free handouts, which may be true, but they’re working hard to get even the simplest things,” Gruver said. “I want to change the stigma that being homeless is easy.”</p>\n<p>Longtime Santa Barbara county houseless resident Jim said he wishes meetings like Houseless Awareness Night were more frequent.</p>\n<p>“I’m grateful it happens in the first place, it’s a good step in the right direction, but more needs to be done,” Jim said. “Only an hour and a half can’t even begin to explain what we go through every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jim, being houseless in Isla Vista is like living in a “war zone.”</p>\n<p>“At night we get this breeze from Alaska that will be like 10 degrees — you can die of hypothermia,” Jim said. “The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone. The people here don’t give a damn about us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/","id":4697,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4696,4695,4694],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The series of events aims to provide students and I.V. residents the opportunity to learn how AB 3 could benefit the community and to advocate for I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 to the State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) with the ability to levy taxes to provide residents with improved local services and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the events are meant to motivate and inform students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s educational, and it’s also in the hopes of empowering people to do work surrounding AB 3, be involved in the process, to really engage with both the bill and the concept of self-governance,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the key to successfully advocating for AB 3 is to educate I.V. residents by canvassing door to door.</p>\n<p>“I really think it’s just getting the word out,” Dela Cruz said. “There’s no way that we can just mail something out and hope that everyone knows about this. You literally have to go and knock on doors and talk to people. So it’s more talking to them and having them engage in the conversation that we’re having.”</p>\n<p>Williams said community engagement will be key to ensuring the events over the next two weeks are successful.</p>\n<p>“This is the time to show the Legislature that local support exists for AB 3, a bill which will create a community services district to meet the specific and unique needs of Isla Vista,” Williams said in an email. “Having backing from the County of Santa Barbara and surrounding cities is crucial to show the need for more direct government in this area.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 supporters being present at this week’s meetings and next week in Sacramento will be key to the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>“Bottom line is we need Isla Vista community members to rally together and be heard in the Legislature,” Williams said in an email. “Their presence is critical to ensure passing of this bill. Their voices need to be heard. They know the challenges first-hand and can serve as a strong force to move this bill successfully through the legislative process.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said AB 3 is unique piece of legislation because it was developed through I.V. stakeholders’ collective efforts.</p>\n<p>“Usually, legislation kind of just comes from Sacramento,” Schunk said. “To the contrary, Das Williams and his office have really kind of stepped up to the plate and done what I think is an outstanding job of really engaging the community.”</p>\n<p>Williams and the Initiative are asking for increased community involvement because of the bill’s importance to the I.V. self-governance movement, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“This bill is so monumental, so it deserves extra attention,” Schunk said. “Every resident of Isla Vista will somehow be impacted by this, so I think it’s critical that we try and hear from as many voices as possible.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he hopes to see a significant number of supporters turn out for the County Legislative Committee, Goleta City Council and LAFCO meetings, he has realistic expectations.</p>\n<p>“I would like to see at least 10 people at each of those meetings, and I don’t think that’s going to be outlandish,” Schunk said. “The more voices that are heard by these different entities, the more they realize that there is a broad and diverse backing for this movement.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he knows Associated Students will have a significant presence at the AB 3 events, but believes there will also be a strong turn out from non-A.S. students.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, I do expect a lot of A.S. members to be there, because those are typically the people who are politically engaged,” Schunk said. “I also do think that we’ve gotten quite a few students both from SBCC and from UCSB who are not involved in student government.”</p>\n<p>According to Dela Cruz, the series of events aims to also include non-student residents and Latino families who are not as involved in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“We had canvassing for the Family Fun Day … where we had volunteers to help us canvas, and just talked to the community,” Dela Cruz said. “Specifically, families for the Family Fun Day geared towards Isla Vista long-term residents and Latino families who don’t often come to our weekly AB 3 meetings on Tuesdays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the goal of the AB 3 events is to show Sacramento legislators there is broad local support for the bill.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we are seeking endorsements from the County and Goleta as well as the residents of I.V. itself, getting people to every event is going to be challenge due to the meetings being scheduled during work/school hours and out of our control,” Abboud said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Food Cooperative and Associated Students met Thursday afternoon at the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>The time of remembrance will begin with a memorial tree-planting at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and conclude with the MMXIV Music in Memory concert. Attendees of Thursday’s meeting discussed details for events such as the candlelight vigil on March 23 and the memorial paddle out on May 27, in addition to new ideas for crafts using recycled materials, potlucks at the food Co-op and Zumba dancing.</p>\n<p>A.S. Isla Vista Community Advisor Diana Collins Puente said I.V. Open Lab is planning a Blue Night art installation to feature blue and yellow LED lights throughout I.V. and campus.</p>\n<p>“They are actually going to light up as much of Isla Vista as possible, as well as campus,” Collins Puente said. “What they are really hoping to do is have businesses adopt that.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op Outreach and Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki said the Co-op wanted to host a potluck at the Pardall Center, and the meeting attendees decided the dinner should take place May 25.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice President Alexandra Meallet said there should be forums for open discussion surrounding the series of memorial events.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s still a time when we’re becoming more comfortable with speaking about it [the May 23 tragedy] and I think open group discussion is pretty healthy,” Meallet said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Pardall Center staff member Natalie Dimas said her sorority Sigma Alpha Zeta has been discussing arranging a Zumba class if they could secure funding and coordinate with the Pardall Center staff.</p>\n<p>“Dancing can relieve stress and it is a method of coping,” Dimas said. “I’ve been looking around and seeing if I could find a Zumba instructor that would provide the class at a reduced price, if anything.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Director Jeanne Stanford said it is important to remember individuals cope with tragedy in different ways and to be respectful of other’s methods if they differ from your own.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of people who don’t want to hear anything else about it … and then there’s people that want to remember it,” Stanford said. “Whether you want to turn away from it or you want to delve into it, we shouldn’t be judging each other.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said C.A.P.S. staff will be available for anyone who wants to talk about the events of May 23 last year, but will not push their services on anyone who does not approach them.</p>\n<p>“We are not saying that anybody needs counseling,” Stanford said. “We didn’t do that last year, because we had just drop-in consultation, because it was an unusual event.”</p>\n<p>Audycki said she thinks local art stores would be willing to help provide craft supplies for an artistic-themed event to commemorate the tragedy and help students heal.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be really therapeutic for some people to be able to create with something that could’ve been destroyed,” Audycki said.</p>\n<p>Puentes said one goal of the memorial events is to tailor them to the variety of ways that students can cope with last year’s tragedy and find healing through community.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we are trying to do is help people access a lot of different ways to be involved, whether it’s more actively or passively,” Puentes said. “We definitely want to make sure that we have mental health and counselling services available to people in a place that is in the community.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said the memorial events will provide an opportunity to honor the students lost and restore faith in humanity.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, as human beings, we remember what happened,” Stanford said. “What we’re doing with remembrances and anniversary events are about community and about restoring people’s faith in humanity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/","id":4726,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4725,4724,4723],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Brimer also said people should view the environment the same way they see their homes and not allow littler to accumulate.</p>\n<p>“If your house is filled with trash, you would not enjoy it,” Brimer said. “The earth is my home so it does make me uncomfortable to see things like littering.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Andrea Renteria said she tabled with her sociology class, Topics in Sexuality, to inform Earth Day attendees that overpopulation is threatening the environment.</p>\n<p>“We are tabling because, if we can control the increase in size of the population, we can lessen problems that directly affect our environment,” Renteria said. “It is through actions where we will see change.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year mathematics major Jose Lombera said students should lead by example to initiate change in the environment.</p>\n<p>“If we recycle more and keep our community clean, more people will follow this positive model which is good to our earth,” Lombera said. “Future generations can better the environment, but it is up to us to make it as great as we can.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62799\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62799\" data-attachment-id=\"62799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429985213&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.001&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62799\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?resize=600%2C429\" alt=\"80's Alumni band The Tearwayas performed during the Earth Day festival.

id=\"caption-attachment-62679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista and university stakeholders are exploring new methods to cope with current drought conditions given California Governor Jerry Brown’s state-mandated water restrictions issued earlier this month.</p>\n<p>State regulators discussed Brown’s water reduction rules this past Saturday, which cut urban potable water use by 25 percent statewide. According to a California State Water Boards press release, on March 17 the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations that apply to all California residents, prohibiting runoff irrigation to non-irrigated areas, driveway and sidewalk washing and hose use without shutoff nozzles to wash vehicles. In addition, restaurants and other food service establishments have been mandated to only serve water to customers on request.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Recycling and Water Efficiency manager Matthew O’Carroll said the Goleta Water District has robust water conservation programs and relatively low per-capita water use in comparison to other water districts. According to O’Carroll, further water reductions at the university will require higher expenditures.</p>\n<p>“UCSB’s biggest challenge is achieving further potable water reductions,” O’Carroll said in an email. “Just last year, we reduced our potable water consumption 21% compared to the previous year and we are at a point now where we have picked a lot of the ‘low-hanging fruit.’ So future strategies that yield significant potable water savings will also have large upfront costs.”</p>\n<p>According to O’Carroll, while reduction in potable water consumption is a top priority, water conservation for landscape maintenance is less of a priority due to the university’s use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is fortunate enough to have recycled water, a source of water that is of lesser quality than potable/drinking water, but which can be used for certain applications such as irrigation,” O’Carroll said. “Ninety percent of our campus is irrigated with recycled water, and to be honest, if we didn’t have this source, landscape and irrigation could possibly be our largest area of potable water consumption.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department (IVRPD) general manager Rodney Gould said that while recycled water is beneficial to the university in water conservation, it is inaccessible in Isla Vista due to lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately the distribution lines for recycled water stop at UCSB and don’t reach Isla Vista,” Gould said. “We asked Goleta Water District if they would extend the pipes but they indicated they don’t have the funds to do so. If we can find the funding for the infrastructure, they would provide the water.”</p>\n<p>According to Gould, while IVRPD has made significant cuts in water consumption in the past few years, more conservation efforts will be necessary with potentially increasing rates based on a Stage 3 surcharge.</p>\n<p>“With proposed changes in Goleta Water District’s billing structure, the District could potentially experience a $38,000 annual rate increase,” Gould said. “We’ve been watching our water usage very carefully and on average have cut back by 25 percent as compared to the 2012-2013 fiscal year. We’re also in the process of auditing the irrigation in all of our parks looking for leaks, and calculating usage in specific areas.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Food Co-op produce manager Rebekah Miles said local produce suppliers have been hit the hardest, while the Co-op itself has not been greatly affected by the water shortages.<br>\n“For example, we usually have a constant supply of local avocados, but this is the first time in the four-and-a-half years I’ve been here that we’ve had a three month gap in avocado supply,” Miles said.</p>\n<p>Miles also said in addition to water shortage, farmers have been dealing with various pests that are especially prevalent during droughts, such as the bagrada bug that feasts on brassica, a certain leafy green produce.</p>\n<p>“Brassicas include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and various other leafy greens, all of which we carry at the Co-op,” Miles said. “Organics do not use pesticides, so these bugs are really causing problems especially in dry conditions.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said members of the UCSB Bren School formed the Water Action Plan in 2013 after the university surpassed the 20 percent potable water use reduction goal by 2020 mandated by UC Office of the President. According to O’Carroll, developing the Water Action Plan helped identify the major consumers of potable water on campus, which are bathrooms and labs, primarily in academic buildings and residence halls.</p>\n<p>“The majority of our potable water consumption is in academic buildings and in residential housing,” O’Carroll said. “In academic buildings we are looking at more efficient water fixtures in both bathrooms and the lab setting.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said in addition to short-term modifications to conserve water, such as bathroom retrofitting, educational campaigns are also a part of Housing and Residential Services water conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services has continued their commitment to conserving water and has continued to outfit the residence halls with efficient fixtures and also have a very robust education and outreach program,” O’Carroll said.</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) co-chairs third-year biology major Heather Vest and third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh said in a joint statement that changing personal eating habits is one of the most difficult parts about conserving water.</p>\n<p>“One method to reduce is cutting down on water-intensive food choices such as almonds, meat and walnuts, which use a hearty supply of water to produce,” Vest and Suh said in an email. “So much of California’s water usage is agricultural, so it’s important to consume less.”</p>\n<p>According to Vest and Suh, water conservation is most significant at the individual level.</p>\n<p>“As students at UCSB, we often find it difficult to see any effects on our lives personally because with the ways we live, we don’t pay for our water sources within campus and/or Isla Vista housing, so many students do not see the need to decrease our water usage,” Vest and Suh said. “But we need to make choices every day that show we are conscious of the situation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/","id":4724,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4723,4722,4721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss funding an independent financial feasibility study that would break down the costs of pursuing different forms of governance, including a Community Services District (CSD), cityhood and a Municipal Advisory Council. The Fund for Santa Barbara, a nonprofit organization that supports grassroots organizations in Santa Barbara county, expressed interest in organizing the study using funds gathered from local groups and organizations.</p>\n<p>Interim Executive Director of the Fund for Santa Barbara Nancy Weiss said it would cost around $40,000 to conduct a feasibility study for a CSD, with an additional $16,000-$20,000 for cityhood and $10,000 for legal analysis of I.V.’s potential self-governance options. According to Weiss, approximately $32,000 has been committed by community organizations to support these costs.</p>\n<p>“There are a number of commitments that have been made either in writing or verbally for paying for the study,” Weiss said. “That includes individuals and some major entities like UCSB and City College.”</p>\n<p>Even with enough money, the financial feasibility study would still require several months of collecting and analyzing information to complete, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“By the time we press go, sign a contract and have it start, what I understand is two to three months will then be needed to gather all this data and crunch it,” Weiss said. “At this point I don’t even know when a start date will be.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, Community Organizer from the Office of Das Williams, said her existing relationships with local agencies can speed the data collection process.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time it takes for the study is gathering information and reaching out to agencies and all that stuff to get numbers,” Elliott said. “Since I already have relationships with all those agencies, I have a lot of that information that I can send to them that will help speed it along.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, online crowdfunding is another source of revenue that could help pay for the feasibility study.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said fundraising can be done through the I.V. Community Relations Committee as well.</p>\n<p>“We would probably be open to it,” Schunk said. “We could do micro-donations.”</p>\n<p>Participants plan to discuss the boundaries that could potentially be under the administration of a local government in I.V. at next week’s stakeholders’ meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; those who sow courtesy reap friendship, and they who plant kindness gather love.” The club, along with other neighboring Lions Clubs, serves the local Goleta and Santa Barbara area through numerous community service activities.</p>\n<p>UCSB Lions Club President and second-year economics and accounting major Shane Sato said the trees are a step toward recovery for the community.</p>\n<p>“We are proud to plant these trees in remembrances of those we lost in the tragic event in hopes that growth and healing are also planted into the hearts of our Isla Vista community,” Sato said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sato said the idea came primarily from Mitch Grimes, a fourth-year communication major and the Fundraising Officer for the club.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a good idea because Mitch’s dad owns a landscaping company and he’s also in the Lions Club in Pleasanton in Nor Cal,” Sato said. “He thought it would be a good idea if they donated some trees for us.”</p>\n<p>Sato and Grimes said planning for the event began in the winter when they sorted out the necessary logistical steps to proceed with the project.</p>\n<p>“We started planning four months ago trying to get all the trees,” Grimes said. “I think the [Trigo-Pasado] park is a pretty popular location in the middle of I.V. that a lot of people see.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62616\"

with other Lions Clubs from the International organization.</p>\n<p>“We work a lot with the neighboring Lions Clubs, like Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Ventura,” Sato said. “We’ve done blood donations, a multiple sclerosis event, and a veteran’s marathon.”</p>\n<p>Cabinet Treasurer of the Santa Barbara Lions Club Howard Hudson, the “Guiding Lion” and sponsor for the club, said he also oversees and provides support to the local UCSB club.</p>\n<p>“We’re giving them the guidance; we provided them with initial supplies and we’ll continue to give them guidance for the next couple years until they’re really on their feet,” Hudson said. “The UCSB club is going to be focusing on the Goleta and Isla Vista area but they will also be involving themselves with Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<div

Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Associated Students organization Take Back the Night hosted their annual rally and march on Thursday night at Anisq’Oyo’ Park to address sexual assault in Isla Vista and to protest the climate of fear and violence women face near campus areas.</p>\n<p>Approximately 40 participants attended the event to support the campaign against sexual violence. The event included poetry readings, music, art, games, t-shirt making and art projects.</p>\n<p>Editors from <em>Feministing.com</em> Lori Adelman and Jos Truitt spoke at the event about what constitutes feminism.  Adelman said feminism might cause strife between genders as power dynamics change.</p>\n<p>“When we’re talking about feminist goals, we’re not necessarily talking about a zero-sum game,” Adelman said. “There are some things that we are asking, telling and demanding that men and people who have been operating under the privilege of patriarchy give up. And it’s not something they can do without maybe some direct personal loss.”</p>\n<p>According to Adelman, feminism is not a friendly request, but a demand for what is owed to an individual.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t us asking for you to do us a favor and be nice and from the bottom of your heart or to be kind and give us these small feminist wins,” Adelman said. “We’re asking and demanding power. It’s not always going to be an amicable relationship.”</p>\n<p>At sunset, attendees marched through I.V. with signs labeled “Slut shame is victim blame” and “My body is mine.” After the march, attendees regrouped at Anisq’Oyo’ Park for a “survivor circle” to share personal thoughts and stories about sexual violence.</p>\n<p>Take Back the Night Co-chair and third-year feminist studies and English double major and Kelty Kauffman said females are constantly on edge when they are out in the streets after dark.</p>\n<p>“It’s scary going out at night,” Kauffman said. “When you’re someone who’s not a straight white dude, going out at night means doing a checklist in your mind of things that could go wrong, figuring out how to keep yourself safe.”</p>\n<p>According to Kauffman, this year’s event saw a new, wider range of emotions compared to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“This year’s event had a lot of heart,” Kauffman said. “There were a lot of tears and there was a lot of healing, but there was also a lot of laughter, which is not something that I’ve experienced in these spaces before, and that felt really, really good. We were okay to laugh. It was allowed. People were allowed to express themselves however they needed to.”</p>\n<p>Kauffman said the organization aims to empower women in order to gain the same privileges as men.</p>\n<p>“The phrase ‘take back the night’ means taking back our autonomy, our ability to leave the house, our ability to do things like a regular person would, and by regular I mean straight white dudes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said after she was sexually assaulted last year, survivor resources at UCSB advised her against taking the case to court against her wishes. According to Melgoza, Judicial Affairs claimed the case would not make it to court, and if it did, she would not win.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately I only got to enjoy my college experience one quarter here at UCSB,” Melgoza said. “Survivors all have different ways of healing and coping … There’s not a single label or stereotype but unfortunately, Judicial Affairs wanted me to fit a mold. I had to persist and literally argue with them through phone calls, emails and appointments. I had to make sure they were doing their job.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Maya Trifunovic said the event was informative and ensured the topic of rape remained relevant.</p>\n<p>“We still live in a rape culture,” Trifunovic said. “There’s a lot of conversations that I think especially people our age need to be having about the society we want to build as we go out into it. I think it’s a good space and really educated people with a lot of resources and ideas about how to fix that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger said there is more to sexual violence than the victim and the perpetrator, and “sexism encourages rape culture.”</p>\n<p>“There’s so much that plays into sexual assault. I think people tend to look at it as a person to person thing, like it’s an individual perpetrator’s problem,” Ballinger said. “But really, it’s a result of people giving their tacit approval.”</p>\n<p>According to Ballinger, events such as Take Back the Night remind community members and survivors that they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important that survivors know that other people care,” Ballinger said, “and that there’s awareness about it. Being here is educational. It helps me learn more about what’s really going on and things under the surface.”</p>\n<p>Ballinger said sexual assault is more common than most students realize.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody knows someone who is a survivor,” Ballinger said. “You could be sitting in lecture and the person next to you could be a survivor and you wouldn’t know. People just don’t know that they know survivors.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and global studies double major Presly Mellor said “taking back the night” means women should not have to live in fear.</p>\n<p>“I see it very literally where we take back the night,” Mellor said, “where we, as women, can walk freely without feeling threatened, without feeling the need to look over our shoulder multiple times on a walk back home at night, I don’t have to worry about being too drunk or having to walk down a dark street.”</p>\n<p>According to Mellor, she hopes the organization will continue its fight to end sexual violence and assault.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s really empowering to see what younger students are organizing and leading because I’m on my way out, but I still want this work to be done,” Mellor said. “It’s really nice to hear that first-, second- and third-years are going to be dedicated to this cause the rest of their time at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Mellor said though participation rates have not changed since she attended in 2013, the diversity of participants has greatly increased.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a change in the people coming which I think is good, because it shows that more people are interested and different kinds of people, all different majors, different years,” Mellor said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/","id":4721,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4720,4719,4718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Office of Das Williams, Community Discuss I.V.

The services provided by the proposed CSD currently include the ability to fund a municipal advisory council (M.A.C.), which would be an advisory board with no taxation power recommending certain policies to the county board of supervisors. Other services would include an area planning commission, managing a parking district, the ability to contract for additional policing services above the current level provided by the county and university, managing a tenant mediation program to work out disputes between tenants and landlords, the ability run community facilities and the ability to manage lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliot hosted the conference, during which community members had the chance to speak about their opinion on two ideas related to governance. The first proposal of an I.V. CSD was presented by economics professor Lanny Ebenstein, while a second proposal was presented by former resident and alumnus Eric Hutchins.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What you might want to do is stop the endless discussion and start thinking on more global or situational terms. – Former resident and alumnus Eric Hutchins</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ebenstein said an I.V. CSD board could potentially have seven members, one of which would be appointed by UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang, one of which would be appointed from the full County Board of Supervisors and two members elected at large from within the boundaries of the Isla Vista proper, and three elected from districts in IV, two of which would comprise IVRPD jurisdiction and one representing the university property surrounding IV.</p>\n<p>“It is important that people who are residents of the IVRPD, which are the primary boundaries of the IVCSD, are the majority on the IVCSD Board,” Ebenstein said. “What I would suggest would be then four members elected from the boundaries of the IVPRD of which two would have four-year terms on staggered basis — so at each election there would only be one person be elected to a four-year term.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Louis Mariano said if a student is elected to the board, they should have a system in which the student would serve for six months as an intern to gain “institutional knowledge and actually use it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62399\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62399\" data-attachment-id=\"62399\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/ab-3-das-williams-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429037372\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Das Williams-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62399 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies major Akshaya Natarajan said having a student unofficially appointed to the board to gain experience would be good idea.</p>\n<p>“Still being temporary enough where students are empowered to run for one of these positions, but at the same time it still gives them a bit more experience before they have voting power,” Natarajan said. “So perhaps exploring a designate status where they could be elected and serve for six months rather than an internship.”</p>\n<p>Hutchins presented the second proposal of the meeting and said the Assemblyman’s office could hold a CSD conference during which community leaders and businesses could voice their opinion on current CSD ideas. Hutchins said participants could then distribute their plans for comment to I.V. agencies, organizations and interest groups.</p>\n<p>“What you might want to do is stop the endless discussion,” Hutchins said, “and start thinking on more global or situational terms. For me, what that meant was it would be easier to be the task of this group to essentially create two bookend proposals for CSD … and ask the university chancellor and university trustees who are perhaps inconveniently your best friends right now in terms of getting anything through because they have already taken positions on the CSD.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Psychologist Jeremy Roark said he thinks having only people in support of the CSD at the conference may be a more productive option than having a meeting with various community members.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if this next meeting we are talking about — if this day-long conference — if it may be beneficial to ask only those people who we think are in support and that way maybe gain more momentum with more yay-sayers than nay-sayers,” Roark said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he supports Roark’s idea because it provides specific choices to the larger community which can then decide on finalized options.</p>\n<p>“I like what you are talking about in a sense where you have two separate things that forces people to get in the conversation in these areas and institutions to give their answer as to what they want,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>At the end of the meeting, I.V. residents took a poll about who they would prefer to see on the I.V. CSD board, the geographic boundaries for candidates and the number of board members.</p>\n<p>The top choices in each category included university-appointed and Santa Barbara County-appointed members, the CSD boundary comprising either the “box” of I.V. plus university owned property or the box and the West Campus and El Colegio residences, and unanimous agreement for a five-members elected to the I.V. CSD board. Agreement was not unamimous however on the boundaries of an IVCSD.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly detailed the Ebenstein plan as calling for three appointed members of the CSD. That is incorrect, the story has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/","id":4722,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4721,4720,4719],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Continue To Discuss Isla Vista Self-Governance","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Students, Isla Vista residents, Santa Barbara County officials and university administrators gathered Tuesday night at Assemblyman Das Williams’ stakeholder meeting in the I.V.

Clinic building to discuss the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) to facilitate self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), introduced in December to create a CSD for I.V. by act of the state legislature, will be amended to include more detailed plans for the proposed special district before it will be voted on. Tuesday’s meeting was part of a series of meetings that have been hosted by Williams to establish and clarify the bill’s language regarding the creation of a CSD. During this Tuesday’s meeting, stakeholders discussed the extent to which students should be allowed to be involved in self-governance, whether or not county representatives should be on an I.V. governing board and the events of last weekend’s Deltopia festivities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he is in favor of having self-governance representatives from both the university and the county holding positions on a governing board for the CSD.</p>\n<p>“I want the cooperation of UCSB and the county. Basically, I want their advice,” Schunk said. “That’s a big part of it for me. There are a lot of complicated things that we want to do with this CSD and I think that both entities have expressed that they might be comfortable with an ex officio seat.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said any group with an interest in I.V. governance can run a candidate for the board.</p>\n<p>“If there’s other entities … that have a real concern about what’s happening at that level, they’re going to find a candidate and they’re going to put their support behind that candidate,” Soutar said. “That is the electoral process and I don’t know if we need to make it super complicated.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD board member and fourth-year global studies major Jacob Lebell said the university and county’s support will be necessary to form a governing board.</p>\n<p>“In the position we are in now, we need both the county and the university to have support for the board,” Lebell said. “Our interests are not always going to be aligned with it but we need their support for the board to come into existence.”</p>\n<p>Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr, said Farr’s stance on the proposed governing board will not be stated until Williams’ final version of the self-governance bill is signed into law.</p>\n<p>“What I see is her [Farr] waiting until the government signs it [AB3],” Aguilera said. “When that’s signed she will decide whether to endorse it or not. I think as it stands right now she’s undecided.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said the two organizations he is a member of, the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee and the UCSB Foundation Board of Trustees, are in favor of I.V. self-governance, but are awaiting to see what the final plans are before endorsing the stakeholders’ plans.</p>\n<p>“Those two very big players at the university are committed to a process that brings greater self-governance for Isla Vista,” Thurlow said. “What’s not clear I think is, ‘What is that? What form does that take?’ And we’re still not sure what exactly the chancellor can do vis-à-vis a piece of legislation. There’s still some huge questions that aren’t answered. … Finances and boundaries and board makeup.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said he is frustrated with the university and county’s allegedly non-committal attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re all being asked these questions: ‘What boundaries do you want? What board representation do you want?’ We’re all providing our opinions, in some cases impassioned arguments,” Freeman said. “But the university and the county … are in some ways not participating in the process that we’re having right now because they’re simply saying, ‘I’m waiting for you all to come up with what you want and I’ll say yes or no.’”</p>\n<p>In the discussion on the differences between this year’s Deltopia compared to last year’s riots, Schunk said the reduction of crowds by half and the number of medical transports dropping from 50 in 2014 to only nine this year is evidence that I.V. residents are taking charge of the event.</p>\n<p>“I think what we proved to them is that we can add our own structure to the event and the community can really come together and take charge of some portions of it,” Schunk said. “Over time I’m hoping the police force can be reduced and the police feel it is less of a necessity to be here.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and second-year history of public policy major Paola De La Cruz said she noticed a difference in the amount of trash on I.V. streets during the cleanup process the day after Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“When we went out to clean for Adopt-A-Block compared to last year the amount of trash that was on DP and other streets was just, like, ‘Oh my gosh, did Deltopia even happen?’” De La Cruz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62133\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62133\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/","id":4719,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4718,4717,4716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia Calmer Than Last Year’s","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This past weekend’s Deltopia street party did not repeat last year’s violent riots and drew only half the crowd, with approximately 10,000 people on the streets of Isla Vista by midday and only ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62043\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1661429318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62040\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62043\" data-attachment-id=\"62043\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/deltopia-participants-walking-on-dp/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428154403\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia_Alex Gonzalez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62043\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.

The Sheriff’s Office partially attributed smaller crowds to the efforts of I.V. residents to defer out-of-towners from coming into their homes and parties. Other factors contributing to the decrease in attendees, according to the Sheriff’s Office, include the university’s efforts, student-only activities, over 100 police officers from across UC campuses and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the surrounding counties. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the county festival ordinance prohibiting music after 6 p.m. and restricting parking on certain streets in I.V. and Goleta was “instrumental” in reducing the crowd size.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated. – Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the 50 percent decrease in attendance from last year, the Sheriff’s Office stated the number of arrests and citations remained high because of increased presence of law enforcement. Preliminary numbers provided by the Sheriff’s Office count 140 citations and 102 arrests issued, compared to 190 citations and 130 arrests during last year’s Deltopia. Medical incidents this year also decreased significantly with only nine medical transports reported compared to 50 in 2014.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason said in an email the crowds this past weekend were more manageable compared to last year.</p>\n<p>“The crowds were smaller and more respectful than last year,” Eliason said in an email. “On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason, the calmer crowds were in part due to the planning and coordination that began months prior to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think the tremendous planning and coordinated effort by everyone affiliated with the event helped to make it more enjoyable than last year,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the number of arrests and citations were a reflection of the saturation of police within I.V. and not necessarily of a reckless student body.</p>\n<p>“Keep in mind that there were over 300 police officers in a one square mile radius,” Schunk said. “If you have a bunch of people in an area drinking, there are going to be people who are committing crimes. If you have hundreds more police officers, then the rate at which those people who are committing even minor nonviolent offensives, there is a higher chance that there will be a police officer nearby.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property. – Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said he agreed the coordinated efforts demonstrated a sense of ownership by I.V. locals for the event.</p>\n<p>“I noticed a lot of cooperation amongst different entities in order to really take ownership of the event and provide structure,” Schunk said. “UCIV, the campus, IVFP, UCPD, and Life of the Party … There was a sense that this was more than just some wild street party that got out of control automatically.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, if this trend of community involvement continues he believes extra policing will not be necessary at future Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“I think even police officers resonated with that and it helped them show a little more restraint,” Schunk said. “I think over time we could see the level of necessary policing decrease more and more as we add in that structure that helps support the event.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said to continue positive progress for a safer Deltopia, he hopes to see more focus on the student volunteer program University of California Isla Vista (UCIV), which helped facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think really the thing I would love to see targeted and expanded upon next year is the UCIV program. And the idea of student volunteers,” Schunk said. “The reception generally was incredibly favorable. Countless people came up to us and said, ‘Thank you so much for taking your time today to hand out water bottles.’ People were almost incredulous.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr said he understands the need for police action during Deltopia and hopes the event will gradually return to a smaller party meant for I.V. locals.</p>\n<p>“I think the intimidation from the sheer number of police this Deltopia was one of the only benefits of mass law enforcement,” Foehr said. “My 300 person party getting shut down at 3:00 p.m. at the time it seemed unnecessary, but it was for the general welfare and I understand that. I feel that next year’s Deltopia will be more local and back to normal like before the [2014] riots because of this intimidating police presence.”</p>\n<p>Foehr also said he believed the increased police presence had some disadvantages.</p>\n<p>“However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property,” Foehr said. “Also, it’s a waste of public resources to have so many cops here, just because of irresponsible college kids.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Nehanda Wells attended Deltopia this past weekend and said she also experienced a run-in with the police, but the incident did not change her opinion on the positive aspects of additional policing.</p>\n<p>“Outside BevMo! … a cop banged on my window and asked to see my ID. I’ve never had that happen before. It was intimidating because I wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Wells said. “I’m not saying that it was a bad thing. I just think that was reaching too far. But as far as having more police here for the weekend, it obviously worked because things were much calmer this year than last year.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/","id":4748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4747,4746,4745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Adopt-A-Block Holds Isla Vista Clean-up Following Deltopia","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Volunteer organization Adopt-A-Block held an Isla Vista clean-up following a full day of Deltopia festivities on Saturday, drawing over 300 students participants on Sunday.

Many participants were students from various environmental groups, community service organizations and Greek life.</p>\n<p>Adopt-A-Block supervisor Adam Porté said I.V. relies solely on volunteers for clean-up and that without volunteer help, litter would otherwise be left on the streets.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time everywhere else in the world … you’re going to have a private contractor that would come out and clean up all the trash afterwards,” Porté said. “We don’t have that here, so the amount of trash that is generated and is left on the streets from events like this is just essential to have all these volunteers because if we didn’t that stuff would just sit there forever.”</p>\n<p>According to Porté, clean-up events are important because I.V. does not have street sweeping days, and street sweepers are unable to remove trash because of the large number of parked cars.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista we technically don’t have street sweeping days,” Porté said. “All the cars on one side of the street never have to be moved, so a street sweeper can’t get in. So any of the trash you see on the ground never gets picked up except when our volunteers pick it up.”</p>\n<p>Computer engineering major and Lieutenant Governor of Circle K International Club Andrew Pagan said he helped organize and keep track of the logistics of the cleanup.</p>\n<p>“Today we are helping out with registration because we need people to sign waivers and come back to register the number of hours they picked up trash, number of buckets of trash, and blocks they covered,” said Pagan. “Having 300 people in one day in two hours cleans a lot of blocks”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Dejanae Allen said collecting trash is important for the safety of Isla Vistans, especially with the large amount of glass littering the streets.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of glass, so we were trying to pick that up because I know some people walk around barefoot so we got to make sure we get that picked up,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental studies and economics double major Jose Valdez said athough Deltopia this year did not generate as much trash as last year, it is important to clean up litter accumulated to protect the environment.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia was a lot more controlled this year with the huge effort to keep out-of-towners out of here, so people were more controlled so it’s a lot less trash, people were more respectful especially since most of them lived here,” Valdez said. “It’s important to clean the trash up because that trash you see on the sidewalk will end up in the sewers, and that sewer will end up in the water and that’s going to effect the environment.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Anbareen Shefa said trash on streets in I.V. could easily end up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“We’re so close to the ocean when you have heavy winds, the winds just going to blow all the trash into the ocean, so I’m trying to divert that as much as I can,” Shefa said. “There are lots of cigarette butts, which is mostly what I’m after. People smash them into the plants and stuff, it’s sad.”</p>\n<p>Porté said he was content with the number of people that showed up to participate in the cleanup and was glad to take part in the event to improve the I.V. environment.</p>\n<p>“It’s so much fun to come in and see all these people come together to want to clean up their community,” Porté said. “It’s just so rewarding. And I know that I’m helping out the community and know I’m improving the quality of life for 23,000 people. I’m huge on environmentalism, because that ocean out there it can’t protect itself, so we got to do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/","id":4744,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[4743,4742,4741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shooting Victim Files Complaint Against County, Sheriff, Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Former student Antoine Cherchian, a victim of the May 23 Isla Vista shooting last spring who survived multiple gunshot wounds, filed a complaint for damages against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Former student Antoine Cherchian, a victim of the May 23 Isla Vista shooting last spring who survived multiple gunshot wounds, filed a complaint for damages against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, the County of Santa Barbara and the University of California Board of Regents on March 10, alleging a violation of due process under the 14th Amendment.</p>\n<p>The case brief lists events preceding perpetrator and former Santa Barbara City College student Elliot Rodger’s shooting spree, exemplifying him as a public danger. The plaintiff alleges that the Sheriff’s Department violated their own Law Enforcement Services Manual by not investigating the department’s former incidents of contact with Rodger and not performing a background check on California’s gun registration system after receiving complaints about Rodger’s violent tendencies. Cherchian’s brief also alleges the county, Sheriff’s Department and the UC Regents violated policy manuals, the Psychiatric Emergency Team Regulations and the Firearm Policy  by not requesting or providing a mental health evaluation by a licensed clinician after receiving a welfare check request from Rodgers’s mother, Chin Rodgers, on April 30, 2014.</p>\n<p>Because of these violations, Cherchian alleges the defendants deprived him of his right to be free from personal injury and threat of death, claiming each of the accused are legally responsible for the injuries and damages he sustained on May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>The case brief states the Sheriff’s Department and the Regents acted irresponsibly by not acting on the readily available information Rodger himself posted on public websites, which included multiple videos posted to YouTube under his name expressing violent threats. According to the case brief, the Sheriff’s Department also failed to perform a check on the California gun registry or interview any of Rodger’s mental health providers, despite their ability to consult the registry where information on his possession of firearms would have been available.</p>\n<p>“Recklessly and with deliberate indifference … no person from the SBCSD [Sheriff’s Department] or the Regents watched any part of any videos, reviewed any of Rodger’s other online postings, performed any kind of gun ownership or background check, or interviewed any mental health provider where Rodger was a known psychiatric patient,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>Cherchian’s brief also alleges the Sheriff’s Department is essentially responsible for putting those around Rodger in danger because of their lack of investigation into his background and unstable nature.</p>\n<p>“Through their conduct, the officers impliedly affirmed that Rodger was not dangerous to the public, increasing the existing danger to his roommates, their guests, and the general public, living and interacting with Rodger on a daily basis in the college community about him,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>According to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office final investigative summary report on the I.V. mass murder released on Feb. 19, while six law enforcement officers responded to the welfare check request made by Chin Rodger, the sheriff’s deputies found no risk factors that justified a search of Rodger’s apartment or an involuntary mental health hold.</p>\n<p>“[Rodger] explained he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista,” the report states. “The videos were merely a way of expressing himself. There was nothing during the contact with the suspect that gave deputies reason to believe he was a danger to himself or others.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry and math major Jose Brizuela said he believes the Sheriff’s Department should not be the target of Cherchian’s lawsuit because he feels law enforcement did their jobs to the best of their ability.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like the sheriffs should be the people they go for because they were just doing their job to begin with,” Brizuela said. “Even when everything happened, they tried their hardest to stop [Rodger].”</p>\n<p>Brizuela also said this lawsuit may set a precedent for more victims to come forward against the Sheriff’s Department, the Regents and the County.</p>\n<p>“If this guy’s medical bills get paid off and whatever he wants to gets paid off, I’m sure other people will try and do the same,” Brizuela said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major Caroline Park said Rodger’s parents are more to blame than the Sheriff’s Department because she believes they were aware Rodger had purchased weapons and was a potential danger.</p>\n<p>“When I first read about the case, I definitely thought that his parents were more in the wrong than anyone else,” Park said. “They had the most information. They knew he had guns. They knew that he was dangerous.”</p>\n<p>According to the report on the shooting, Rodger’s parents had been informed by his life coach about the manifesto and YouTube videos, but had no knowledge of his weapons and did not view him as a threat to others.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff’s detectives … spoke with both of the suspect’s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, by telephone. The parents were in the process of driving to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles,” the report states. “Both were worried about their son based on the manifesto that had been emailed earlier that evening, but they both found it very difficult to believe that their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.”</p>\n<p>Park also said the Sheriff’s Department has a duty to protect the rights of citizens living in I.V. and were in a difficult position during the welfare check on April 30, 2014. Park said she believes that if law enforcement had searched Rodger’s apartment and found nothing, it would be assumed they were violating his rights and would set a bad precedent.</p>\n<p>“I think either way it could have gone wrong. If they were able to search his house and find something, that would have been great,” Park said. “But if it didn’t happen that way, that would be violating his rights. That could happen to any one of us in I.V. and I think that sets a bad example.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of news and media relations at the Office of Public Affairs, George Foulsham, declined to comment on the case, stating the university does not comment on pending litigation.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Santa Barbara County Counsel and Cherchian’s legal team did not respond to requests for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/","id":4758,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[4757,4756,4755],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":26,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
