The alleged data thieves have since been arrested, according to the notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement did not specify whether it was Santa Barbara city or county police that notified the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates said it was notified by police on March 23 about the potentially affected applicants, including a list of their email addresses. According to Wolfe &amp; Associates, these individuals have been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Erin Valenzuela, a third-year communications and philosophy double major, only one person in her four-person Wolfe &amp; Associates-managed apartment had been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found out more from twitter than I did from them,” she wrote in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fourth-year student who leased with Wolfe &amp; Associates from 2016-18, and asked not to be named because they intend to pursue legal action, said in a message that “The main concern is the cosigners.

CSD) agreed to house the collective, the IVCC secured a $43,000 grant from the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) to run the program for slightly less than a year, accounting for breaks throughout the school year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said during the meeting that it is an accomplishment for both the I.V. CSD and the IVCC to be able to run the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really big win for the compost collective to obtain that source of revenue for almost a full year’s worth of operations, which is a really big deal,” Brandt said. “For us, we’ve stood up here all the time when people come to us with great ideas, which is great. But an idea just by itself without any action doesn’t always materialize into something that’s actually change-making.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC serves 96 homes in I.V., collecting composting buckets and delivering compost to gardens throughout I.V with the help of student workers called “dirtriders.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel extremely, extremely relieved and ecstatic that we have found a new home for the compost collective, and I’m very excited for the future,” said Jacob Bider, the current IVCC director and a fourth-year environmental studies major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Bider said he hopes to expand the program’s capabilities to serve more houses; currently, the IVCC has more than 100 houses on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did recently request funding [from the </span><a href=\"https://www.fundforsantabarbara.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fund for Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">] for a new cargo trailer that has increased capacity that would allow us to collect more compost, which would allow us to expand the program without having to add more workers,” Bider explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re also looking into the potential of using compostable bags instead of our buckets, which would save us a large amount of time because we wash every bucket after we switch them out for houses.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

For the leasing aspect of the website, prospective tenants can review topics such as landlord responsiveness and timely repairs, as well as general experiences in renting from the landlord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move-out section will allow tenants to say whether their landlord set clear expectations for the move-out, such as whether or not the prospective tenant is expected to hire an outside cleaning company, according to Menzhausen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The renter will also be able to choose whether or not they would recommend their landlord to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s almost like when you sign up for classes, right, with RateMyProfessor, you want to know what you’re getting into,” Menzhausen said. “The syllabus may not encompass everything that’s actually going to happen.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landlords will be able to respond to what their tenants post about them, but renter posts themselves will be anonymous in order to prevent possible retaliation, according to Lieberman. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some landlords have expressed concerns over how renters might use the website, especially if it is based on anonymous reviews. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t usually say anything [on review websites] unless they’re upset,” said Michelle Roberson, president of Sierra Property Management. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When they’re trying to get leverage over a situation, that’s when they go on there to make things go their way. It’s almost a threat instead of an unbiased opinion or review, in our experience,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are other websites where renters may review their rental experience, such as Yelp, ratemyivrental.com is aiming to have streamlined reviews so I.V. residents can learn about their rental options in one place, rather than going to multiple websites.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website is partially designed to keep landlords accountable to their tenants, according to Menzhausen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Holding them to higher standards, and then for the landlords that do treat their tenants really well, getting to promote them and showcase them as student favorites,” she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/isla-vista-rental-review-website-currently-in-development/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/isla-vista-rental-review-website-currently-in-development/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/isla-vista-rental-review-website-currently-in-development/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/isla-vista-rental-review-website-currently-in-development/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/isla-vista-rental-review-website-currently-in-development/","id":4301,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4300,4299,4298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Community Gathers To Celebrate Life of Isla Vista Advocate Michael Bean","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beane-Memorial_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beane-Memorial_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Bean instituted the Isla Vista Free Box, a community donation box in front of the I.V.

Recreation &amp; Park District building, and was a guest speaker at various UC Santa Barbara classes — was remembered as “the type of person to respect all people, regardless of who they were,” said Marcelino Sepulveda, a friend of Bean’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He touched many generations of people, and that is represented here today. Today is an opportunity for the greater community to honor Michael for who he was and what he gave us,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees spoke of Bean’s talent for bringing together generations; UCSB students and permanent Isla Vista residents alike touted his dedication to the community around him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had an uncanny ability to see past age and see the person instead, which made people of all ages enjoy his company and want to spend more time with him,” one tearful community member explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean’s commitment to the environment was “unparalleled,” they added. Bean often biked through the streets of I.V. collecting trash and was a strong proponent for a community forest to feed food-insecure community members, the community member said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean was also an active member of the spiritual group Diamond Heart, as several mentioned at the memorial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our group sessions, we would share personal information that was often very difficult to say. Michael would always be there with a kind word, to listen and in turn share his personal stories,” according to one speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to members of Bean’s various community groups, UCSB students also found inspiration in Bean’s dedication to an environmental community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would often read together,” Ash Vincent, a UCSB environmental studies and feminist studies major, said. “He was always interested in what me or any other people were reading, and I thought sharing that shows how he was always interested and always learning new ways he could be useful to the community.

In addition to a petition to dedicate the Free Box to Bean, Vincent encouraged attendees to email him for a copy of an Ecovista source book that Bean wrote before his death.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student — Bean’s neighbor and an environmental studies major, who remained unnamed — acknowledged his uncommon relationship with Bean, who he met in UCSB Professor John Foran’s sociology class Earth in Crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had a very special connection to this place, and I got to see him try and better himself and our community… seeing him biking around and coming home to him feeding the scrub jays in our yard was a really special moment for me, and I’ve been doing my best to feed them for him,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sepulveda, who helped organize the celebration of life, asked attendees to take wildflower seeds and spread them around I.V. following the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We invite you to take these and disperse them, so that his spirit may grow and blossom amongst the flowers here,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The police department claimed at the time that the radio station was preventing them from doing their jobs in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Owens explained, I.V.’s Bank of America at the time had become a symbol of the capitalist establishment, which many student activists attributed as the cause of oppressive social issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hour-long special takes listeners on a deep dive into the KCSB archives, featuring KCSB news coverage of the Isla Vista riots — often phoned in at the scene from telephone booths — the bank burning and recordings that depicted police violence against protestors, according to Lisa Osborn, current news director at KCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound bites from key players like the Santa Barbara Police Department and then-defense attorney in the Chicago Seven trial William Kunstler, as well as accounts from former students, provide different perspectives on what happened and the consequences that followed. Sound bites of I.V. and narration from Owens illustrate the entirety of I.V. in 1970, later coined the “Year of Rebellion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For Isla Vista, 1970 was the scene of a bank burning, a fatal shooting with a student by a police office, novel law enforcement riot tactics, police brutality and mass arrests,” Owens said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What came in February, April and June in Isla Vista spun its web around the symbol of the establishment: the Bank of America,” Owen said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program takes a chronological approach, starting with the events that lead up to the Bank of America burning in February before taking listeners through the consequences that followed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A day before the Bank of America building burned, the special says the Santa Barbara Police arrested two men. According to the special, the warrants for their arrests cited their use of obscenities during an earlier protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An argument ensued between the officers and the men, forming a crowd that quickly grew upset when the men were arrested. The crowd took action, desecrating the policeman’s car and eventually lighting it on fire. Another officer removed the police from the scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, and hours before the infamous bank burning, Kunstler had been scheduled to speak at the Harder stadium. The special included the audio from Kunstler’s speech at Harder Stadium, which focused on the frustrations of youth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In his book, Justice Douglas said the establishment today is the same as George the third. And he said if the establishment does not stop its stampede toward oppression and repression, then the only honorable course is what men did in 1776,” Kunstler said in his speech at Harder Stadium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owens explained how the timing of Kunstler’s speech, and the bank burning later that day, led the former state Attorney General to investigate Kunstler for inciting a riot. No evidence involving Kunstler was found, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when authorities showed up later that evening to control the crowds gathered on Embarcadero del Norte, they “proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds of tear gas at the demonstrators,” the special stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions climaxed at the Bank of America building, where Embarcadero Hall stands today. The bank was first looted and later set on fire — twice —  first around 7 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and again around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, KCSB was broadcasting it all live. Owens extracted these clips from vintage KCSB archives to allow listeners to hear from the reporters who very first covered it, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pardall may be clear now, I’m not sure. I am beginning to feel the tear gas in my throat. I hear teargas rockets continuing to be fired off, which means they are coming from the overpass,” an unnamed KCSB reporter phoned in to the radio station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the chaos ensued, KCSB student reporters described the riot’s atmosphere, preserving the sounds and images they witnessed from the streets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An incendiary device has been thrown into the Bank of America right now, and it is burning very brightly on the floor with high flames shooting almost to the roof,” an anonymous KCSB reporter said. “However, again, you have your opposing factions in Isla Vista because almost as soon as that device was off inside the Bank of America, two guys went running through and attempted to stomp out the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 18, a second riot occured at the bank. Violence ensued when it became known that the UCSB administration canceled a scheduled speech by a Chicago 7 defendant, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this riot, Santa Barbara police officer David Gosselin shot and killed 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran, an economics major who was seeking to protect the bank from other student protestors. Gosselin, according to the special, claimed his rifle had misfired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemonium and confusion caused by the heavy exchange of gunfire during the first moments of conflict make it impossible at this time to accurately determine whether or not the officer fired the fatal projectile,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff James Webster said in a sound bite from a press conference featured in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the second protest, KCSB was ordered by Sheriff Webster to shut down its broadcasts; Webster stated at the time that KCSB’s broadcasting of the officer’s operations and locations were “making the enforcement of this area absolutely intolerable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webster claimed he had the authority to shut down KCSB’s broadcasts despite dismissing questions about federal protections over the press, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shut down KCSB — that’s very rare, because we’re licensed by the federal government, not the local cops, but because the Regents hold our license, supposedly, they wanted us off the air,” Osborn said, explaining how local police blamed KCSB for inciting violence at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB returned to air five days later and continued to cover life in I.V., including having interviews with community residents who recounted the violence they witnessed. During the special, one woman recounts seeing the police assaulting her husband, describing the sequence as she chokes back tears. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Somebody yelled, ‘I think the police were coming.’ He stopped and the police rushed up the stairs, grabbed him and hit him in the stomach and dragged him down,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third disturbance in June led to a strictly enforced curfew and an increased presence from the Los Angeles Special Enforcement Bureau in I.V., leading to numerous complaints from residents, according to Owens in the documentary. Godfrey recalls that from dusk until dawn, no one was allowed outside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of America eventually closed its Isla Vista branch for good in 1981; now, Embarcadero Hall, a UCSB lecture hall, stands in its place.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/","id":4103,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4102,4101,4100],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Based Island View Outfitters Celebrates 10th Anniversary, Owner Reflects on Company’s Growth and Future","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV-Wanderlust_Alaska-Yokota_ONLINE_1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV-Wanderlust_Alaska-Yokota_ONLINE_1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gerstenberger created Island View Outfitters, now located on Trigo Road, in his second year at UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On their own, a vat of ink, a mesh and a squeegee don’t add up to much.

They had a garage,” Gerstenberger said. “And the second that I had space was, ‘let’s go buy a piece of equipment and make it happen.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gertsenberger also touched on his eagerness to begin screen-printing, which he said he was drawn to from the beginning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that I could actually see the process of creating a stencil on a mesh with ink and a squeegee and create a final product is, I think, really fascinating.” Ultimately, he said, he “just wanted to have a print shop in a garage just so [he] could make [his] own t-shirts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Gerstenberger built his passion project into a small business, starting with $7,000 in investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “$7,000 is a lot in some mindsets,” he said. But, assuming one order of t-shirts was worth $500, “I could do … 10 jobs or 20 jobs in two years and make my money back.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon enough, he had far more than 20 jobs coming his way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerstenberger recalled working 40 to 50 hours a week at the beginning, which, according to his calculations, was often far less than minimum wage. But the business kept growing, necessitating five moves across Goleta and Santa Barbara in search of bigger spaces to keep up with demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At times, I hoped that there was an electrical fire that happened where we could just be like, ‘bummer, it all burned down and we got to move on,’” he joked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as the company grew, something had to give; in this case, it was Gerstenberger’s economics major, which he dropped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s ironic, because I walked into the econ department saying I’m gonna start a small business … ‘Do you guys have any suggestions?’” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department advised that he “apply the theories” that he learned in his classes. Later, when Gerstenberger returned at wits’ end to ask if he could use his business as the basis of a research project, which would have allowed him to reduce his course load, they turned him down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[They were] like, ‘sorry, we can’t do anything,’” Gerstenberger said. “‘We can’t do independent study,’ like, ‘this is the way it is.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these hardships, Gerstenberger said he lives for what he does.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve learned to realize that the people around me are the most valuable thing I have,” he said, listing customers that range from  PTA moms, to “a random group of people from elementary school” to “a small business here to a medium-sized business there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone needs t-shirts,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular relationship that stuck with Gerstenberger is Jose Cardoso, a fellow screen printer with over 25 years of experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We met when I was in the garage and I didn’t have the experience that I needed to do everything,” Gerstenberger said. “And so I’d send him jobs that I couldn’t do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gerstenberger, the pair quickly settled into their own roles: he the “designer and sales,” and Cardoso the “master printer.” After a year of working together, they decided to join forces for good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trust in other people and … let other people do the things that aren’t your strengths,” Gerstenberger said. “Divide and conquer was something that was important for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Gerstenberger said he is looking to expand operations to universities beyond UCSB and to parts of northern California. More recently, in 2018, Island View Outfitters moved their print shop to Cuyama, a town two hours away from I.V. with “a market, a gas station and a hotel,” and little else, but with cheaper manufacturing costs and the ability to ship to anywhere in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The future is never certain, and the difficulty with a small business is we don’t have that control,” he added. “On the other side though, it’s not a matter about what the future is. It’s a matter about today, it’s a matter about the present.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div

</span><em>Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But collecting this data involves a large amount of behind-the-scenes work to keep it running from decade to decade. To help students at UC Santa Barbara understand how the census works, U.S. Census Bureau Media Specialist Vanessa Moreno sat down with the Nexus to speak about how exactly collecting population data at UCSB and in I.V. works. Moreno specializes in dispelling misconceptions around the census and providing citizens a solid foundation for understanding how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first U.S. Census was administered in 1790, and one has followed every 10 years since that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The census also determines congressional apportionments for the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We allocate over $675 billion each year across the country for services … things that everyone’s going to use at one point or another. That’s why it’s really important to get a fair and accurate count of everyone,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of methods the U.S. Census Bureau employs to get an accurate count of the population, which depend on the living situation of those being counted. For those who live in residences such as houses or apartments, the occupants of each space are invited to respond to the census via the phone, mail or online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll send mail out invitation[s] to respond in mid-March. It’ll be a letter, and it will be addressed to the residence, not the residents, not the actual people living there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, reminders will be sent to those who have not yet responded. If all else fails, an enumerator, a representative of the U.S. Census Bureau tasked with interviewing non-responses, will be sent to a residence in a last-ditch effort to obtain a proper count for the residence, according to Moreno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an accurate number of students living in residence halls or university apartments, the U.S. Census Bureau will instead contact the university directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any students that live in the dorms or student apartments don’t have to take the census themselves because we [have] already contacted or we are contacting [university] administrators and asking them how many people live there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who do not have a permanent residence, census enumerators must take a more active role in obtaining a count. First, Moreno said, representatives will be sent to service-based localities such as soup kitchens or homeless shelters, where they will contact those who head those services to obtain a count of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After, she said the U.S. Census Bureau will have people go to other locations, such as freeway underpasses or encampments, and do a physical count of how many people live there over a three-day period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process takes months, and the results of the census are compiled and delivered to the president in December, with the results available to the public in early 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also noted that those working with the U.S. Census Bureau must take an oath of confidentiality before carrying out any tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will never tell, for example, your landlord that you have more people living there than you should have. That’s not something we can or would do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take a lifetime oath to protect people’s information. And if we ever were to break that oath, we are subject to a $250,000 fine or five years in prison,” Moreno said. “So no one is too eager to break that oath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also addressed a point of controversy that has sparked criticism of the census in recent times. In </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/trump-census-citizenship-question.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, but Moreno emphasized that the addition in question was struck down and will not be on the 2020 census.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no fear necessary when filling out the census,” Moreno said. “[People’s] information is safe and protected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is a college town with residents who often move and may not be aware of how the census is carried out — or what relevance it has to their community— Moreno said there is some likelihood of an undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno went over a number of risk factors that could lead to this outcome, including the tendency for parents to include their children as residents in their household while the children are actually living at college, as well as resident fears that information obtained by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used against them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequences of an undercount are significant, Moreno said, noting it can result in inaccurate apportionment in the House of Representatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is the risk of California losing a seat in Congress,” Moreno said, adding that impacts to federal funding could also be severe, depending on the magnitude of the undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically any social service that you can think of could be affected if people don’t make themselves count, and there’s no way to reassess the census once it’s been done until the next census,” Moreno said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is estimated that for every person that [isn’t counted] about $2,000 per year are lost from funding. Let’s say 100 people don’t answer. That’s like $200,000,” she said. “Then you multiply it by 10 years and it’s like $2 million.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

transformed into a warm yet still stylish space. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The few seats available had been claimed, leaving others to bunch up near the door, craning to catch a glimpse at the men responsible for filling the Friday night air with music. A group of professors sat together toward the front of the room, while other adults from the local Santa Barbara community sat at tables enjoying food. Students crowded the back, mostly standing and swaying to the beat, and Chancellor Henry T. Yang and his wife were seated at a far table with their eyes fixed on the band at the front, the music uniting different and usually separate groups of people that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the scene of the first performance of the new year for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, a pop-up club featuring a series of local musicians who aim to bring the Isla Vista community together and provide a space for music and conversation on important topics. The event series was founded in 2015 by Jeffrey Stewart, a professor in UC Santa Barbara’s Department of Black Studies​ and a recent Pulitzer Prize winner for the biography “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the project was formed as a response to the distress felt after the Isla Vista tragedy, Stewart said. Wanting to bring the people of I.V. back together again, Stewart could think of no better way than through music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea was initially sparked by a student’s comment that made note of the similarities between the small, congested and tense venues in Paris and those in I.V. Inspired by the intimacy of the jazz clubs, Stewart said he saw the value in replicating them for the community surrounding UCSB and I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was in Pasadena, we used to have coffeehouses and people would play jazz, so I just tried to reproduce it,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each venue for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is carefully selected and transformed into a warm yet still stylish space, Stewart said. The series also works in conjunction with Stewart’s class, History of Jazz, and runs alongside it during winter quarter. After trying to bring musicians into class to perform for students, Stewart said he quickly realized that it wasn’t the right environment for students, or anyone for that matter, to be able to enjoy or appreciate jazz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need learning environments in the community that aren’t as heavy handed as a real classroom,” Stewart noted. Now, with the creation of Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, his students are always in attendance and able to experience jazz in its natural setting, rather than in a classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The theory of the class is that jazz evolves through dialogue between the performers and the audience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart said he hopes that students will discover new tastes and different preferences through  the music they experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s his goal “that the students have a feeling that they’re part of this, [that] they’re not just spectators or listeners.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its creation, Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse has been unique in its ability to attract a wide variety of different people to its events, Stewart said. He noted that “a lot of students live here, but they have really no interaction with the people in the community,” which he aims to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events such as Stewart’s are one of a few that make an attempt to bridge the gap between different generations in the community, he said. While it’s often rare to see professors, students and locals of I.V. together in the same space, these events encourage exactly that, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only here can a professor show their students how to properly bust a move on the dance floor, while Chancellor Yang catches it all on video. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s not really a space on campus even for professors to hang out,” Stewart added. While the University Center is often the go-to meeting spot, he said “it doesn’t seem warm; it often feels cold and commercial.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These events also provide a much-needed outlet and space for dialogue among I.V. residents, Stewart said. Often featuring spoken word and panels on relevant issues like intersectional justice, gender, violence and food insecurity, these pop-up clubs make an effort to accompany music with meaningful conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart emphasized the need for these types of spaces, remarking that “there are very few places where students can come and have discussions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is proof, Stewart said, that “you can have learning going on in spaces that are also pleasurable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to have this cited in Isla Vista, in the hopes that more people will come from downtown and be able to view this community not just as some crazy college town,” Stewart said — a testament to the power music has to bring a community together.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-92762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years. <em>Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Gardens, the counterpart to Tropicana Del Norte, will now solely house UC Santa Barbara students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift in housing is motivated by the different schedules of the two schools, said Dave Wilcox, executive director of Tropicana Student Living, which manages the two properties. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) runs on a semester system, starting in August and ending in May, while UCSB works on a quarter system, starting in late September and ending in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After evaluating our numbers over the past couple of years, [Tropicana Student Living] decided that it was best for all parties to make a change to better support both sets of students,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, with all the students [in one dorm] attending the same school, everyone can start and end at the same time,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilcox emphasized that there will be no change in the number of SBCC students and UCSB students living in Tropicana Student Living overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We aren’t adding anything or taking anything away,” Wilcox said. “Overall, we expect our SBCC student numbers and UCSB student numbers to stay roughly the same, with 300 SBCC and 600 UCSB students.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years, Wilcox explained. The city college doesn’t have any residence halls near its campus, which is located in downtown Santa Barbara, so Tropicana has housed SBCC students who want a residence hall experience, Wilcox said. To get to school, SBCC students can take the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District line 15X from Tropicana Del Norte, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the housing change, Wilcox said that incoming UCSB and SBCC students will receive the exact same residence hall experience as students have had in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now we can provide more direct services that are 100% geared towards their specific school,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Student Living talked with both SBCC and UCSB administration to inform them of the decision and to see if there could be any negative impacts, but “everyone we spoke with all saw the benefits of making this shift,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Del Norte is currently being advertised to SBCC students on the university’s website under the housing section, according to Wilcox. As opposed to living in a house or apartment in Isla Vista, downtown Santa Barbara or the general Santa Barbara area, Wilcox said, “if SBCC students want to have a residence hall experience, Tropicana is the only option available to them.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. <em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident was first </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/exb9tr/sigma_nu_is_disgusting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about to r/UCSantaBarbara, a subreddit for the UC Santa Barbara community, and was soon shared on various other UCSB social media spaces as well, including the Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Reddit post, the user wrote about attending a Sigma Nu house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He asked her if “her friend in the red(me) Is a [transgender woman] because someone at the door let a [transgender woman] in” and it was his job to go find her. My friend said no she’s not and that’s so fucked up [of] u guys to even ask,” the user wrote, referencing the slur that the fraternity member allegedly used to refer to a transgender woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then he apologized and showed her the SNU group [messages] where someone had asked “who the fuck let that [transgender woman] in” and something along the lines of “kick her out” then he replied saying “I found a girl I thought was her but she’s not it. I’ll keep searching”.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reddit user who posted about the incident did not respond to a message from a Nexus reporter asking for further information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir was the first to bring up the post at the meeting on Monday, noting that many students had approached her over the weekend about the post. Sir asked Interfraternity Council President Jason Stone what the council was doing to address the complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not actually aware of the details of that, but generally speaking, with regard to discrimination, it’s something we take seriously,” Stone said. “I’m absolutely ready to visit that as I’m able to understand that situation, but I’m not really aware of it right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), added that “notably our Greek leader retreat occurred this past weekend, so several leaders in the Greek community were actually not in Isla Vista during the weekend, so there’s some communication delay.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said his office had been notified about the post and had started to look into it, but was not aware of the poster’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alvarez stepped in to say that the Title IX office had also received a report about the incident, and had reached out to the user who made the Reddit post. She did not specify who made the report to the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve received some data and screenshots of some group chats so that is data we’re collecting, and we are trying to figure out what additional information is available and figure out next steps in our response,” Alvarez told the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the office feels like it has enough information to move forward, Alvarez said it will conduct an assessment to see if the report falls underneath either the nondiscrimination policy or the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t meet the criteria under those two policies, I’m unable to take action, but I will forward it then over to the Office of Student Life to potentially take action under additional codes,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said in an interview afterward that her office and several other offices had started looking into the incident, but since the only formal report was made to the Title IX office, that office is now in charge of the investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said at the meeting, however, that it’s difficult for the office to issue any disciplinary action in response to “speech infractions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Generally, even the most offensive speech is permitted by the law, and therefore [permitted by] our policy as a government organization,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we wind up in a position where we may not be able to hold a person accountable in terms of a change to their student status or a formal warning or something like that, but we do still have the opportunity as an institution to express our values, express our concern, to offer the voluntary education,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists President Kyremina Youssef touched upon the incident in a later discussion during the meeting about timely notifications to the community, saying that while many students had seen the post circulating on social media, they hadn’t heard anything from administrators.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said she and others wanted to see a statement from UCSB administrators in support of transgender students and offering resources to those affected by the post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like students are just waiting on UC administration to say something,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said after the meeting that while she believes it’s important to “let the student body know how we feel about this and our values,” a statement from the university would likely come in her monthly newsletter as opposed to a campus-wide email from the chancellor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating, when this happens,” Armistead said. “It’s just so against our values, and it’s hurtful. We definitely can have some more conversations with all of our organizations to make sure that they’re inclusive, and that’s definitely something I’ll be proactive with.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But winter break brings a decrease in customers, and despite the density in population, college students can turn out to be a much more difficult demographic to break into,  Yamasaki explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yamasaki, this is because students often have limited resources and have a higher standard for what they are willing to spend money on and the value they are getting. Businesses struggle to meet this standard at a price that pays the bills, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high cost of living also makes it hard for businesses to have sufficient time to establish the roots they need to develop a following, especially for smaller businesses, according to Darien Nisbett, marketing representative at Woodstock’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would imagine it is difficult to generate the sales necessary to pay your employees a living wage and eliminate turnover in that sense as well,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, winter break brings the challenge of finding people to work; UCSB or Santa Barbara Community College students make up the majority of employees — Nisbett said students make up 90% of employees at Woodstock’s, which means they often go home for breaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the store can bring more benefits than keeping it open; maintaining a healthy store is not simply about cash flow but also maintaining an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take this time to update the restaurant … [We] see an increase in business in-store from families in the surrounding areas and businesses in Goleta, as well as deliveries,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. Yamasaki said he has noticed an increasing number of students who choose to stay over break. And as these businesses have developed a more consistent customer base, they can rely on some of these students to still support the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We stayed open almost the whole break and we gained some understanding that many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international and out-of-state students are still here. They appreciate having some place to hang out and eat,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides winter break, summer also proves challenging to businesses, which often find profits to be cut in half for three months out of the year. But this trend appears to also be shifting slightly, according to Yamasaki.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot more students seem to be taking summer school. The UC keeps admitting more students and I think it encourages just generally higher populations and people that will visit during the summer,” Yamasaki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, one way for unestablished businesses to manage and learn to thrive in I.V. year round is to refine methods during breaks and summers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not even the initial capital to start a business, but the capital it takes on your personal life to really almost be a martyr to the business for a few years until it establishes those solid roots,” Yamasaki added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/","id":4286,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4285,4284,4283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Beautification Program Provides Work for Local Houseless People","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=960%2C540&ssl=1","description":"Part of Ron Moomey’s transition out of houselessness came from a job with the SeeClickFix program in I.V. called Isla Vista Beautiful. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early last year, Ron Moomey was houseless and lived in downtown Santa Barbara’s PATH shelter before moving to Isla Vista, where he occasionally slept in Anisq’Oyo’ Park.

CSD), hires houseless people and pays them $15 an hour for various cleaning and landscaping tasks, according to Emily Allen, the United Way nonprofit’s director of Homeless and Veterans Impact Initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was homeless, they hired me for this, now I’m not homeless,” Moomey said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said he works around 20 hours a week, responding to the numerous service requests by users of the SeeClickFix app, which can range from graffiti cleanup and cutting overgrown weeds to removing Lime scooters on sidewalks. Anyone can download the SeeClickFix app, take photos of a nuisance in Isla Vista and someone — possibly Moomey — will fix the problem.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since working as the local beautification specialist, Moomey said that he has seen a tangible change in the community, in part from the work he has done so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of the homeless individuals here. Well, I guess I inspired them; they see what I’m doing picking up trash, doing landscaping stuff. They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A

SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, aimed at curbing the number of citations issued in Isla Vista, allows residents who have violated one of three ordinances — ordinance 36-2, consuming alcohol in public; 36-3, having an open container; or 40-2, playing loud music outside of curfew hours — the chance to wipe the violations from their permanent record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, which </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officially on Oct. 4, was advertised as a way to create a “bridge between law enforcement and the community” — the same sentiment that has been advertised in other programs Schroeder has created since taking the position of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s community resource deputy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must attend a class, typically taught by Schroeder and members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department, and perform a number of community service hours. Guest speakers are also invited to talk to residents about the impact their actions have on others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the program’s launch on Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, 58 people received citations for one of the three violations listed above. Of the 58 people, 49 signed up to attend the class; 31 have finished the classes but have not yet completed the community service portion, according to Schroeder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw a huge peak [in attendance] when it first launched, which was right before Halloween,” Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there was a “significant drop” during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break, a period in which most students leave Isla Vista for the three-week gap between quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be eligible to have a citation waived, residents must register for the program in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and have to complete the classes themselves within 90 days. Schroeder hopes to launch an app in the near future that would allow residents to sign up using their smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical class is two hours long and begins with a brief history of Isla Vista, discussing more “high-profile” incidents that newer students may not know about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees also are guided through an interactive activity, in which they attempt to solve a community problem. Schroeder and guest speakers also explain why certain policies are in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that they additionally go into “how people can make safer choices when using alcohol and drugs — not necessarily telling them not to do it, but how to do it safely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has been a “mostly good mix” of UCSB and Santa Barbara City College students attending the classes, Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three classes have been held so far, and the typical class sees between 15 and 20 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schroeder also noted that citations issued in Isla Vista are down 50% from last year, a fact he attributed in part to Isla Vista outreach programs, such as the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which launched last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not lecturing these people — we really are trying to work with them to make sure crimes are reduced in the future. They’re part of the group solving the solutions,” he noted. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
