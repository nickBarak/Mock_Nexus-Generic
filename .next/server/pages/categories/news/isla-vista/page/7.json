Rumor has it that boiling water can cleanse a lot more than germs (sins). Come help cook for your community and stop by 777 Camino Pescadero at 2:30 p.m., when the cooking commences. At 5 p.m., you can serve the food at Little Acorn Park. After the cooking is done, clean those sins away (just kidding, the kitchen) at 6:15 p.m. back at 777 Camino Pescadero. The organization is always in need of new volunteers and cooks for vegan-only food using donations from farmer’s markets and the Isla Vista Co-op. </span></p>\n<p><b>Birote the Musical, Weep Wave and ///Internet</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If pass times treated you well this quarter and you don’t have any classes this Friday, then there is no better way to spend your night than at Biko Garage.

Le dan mucho gusto. Llegan y me saludan,”” Camacho said in an interview with the Nexus. “Creo que va hacer un éxito.”</p>\n<p>“All the young people of the university are very happy. They like [the truck] a lot. They come and they greet me,” Camacho said. “I believe it will be a success.”</p>\n<p>UCSB prohibited Camacho from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">selling food on campus in 2017</a> due to violations with its Environmental Health and Safety policies for off-campus food vendors.</p>\n<p>Camacho then began collecting funds to transfer his business from the small blue cart he used on campus to a new food truck. He used money from his savings in addition to a loan to bring the project to life.</p>\n<p>“Empezó el proyecto cuando desde el momento que nos sacaron de la universidad,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>“The project started from the moment they took us out from the university,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho previously sold food on campus in collaboration with student organizations from UCSB for fundraising events when the Office of Student Life still gave permits to vendors like Camacho to sell on campus.</p>\n<p>Some of the student organizations that Camacho worked with tried to raise money for Camacho after he was banned from selling on campus. Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educación y Revolución (M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB) created a GoFundMe page to fundraise money for Camacho’s new food truck.</p>\n<p>GoFundMe later refunded the money because M.U.J.E.R. was unaware of the time limit policy on fundraisers, according to M.U.J.E.R. former co-chair Dulce Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>The inside of the truck has a built-in kitchen with a freezer, an ice machine and three sinks for Camacho to prepare his products.</p>\n<p>Currently, Camacho sells food in Isla Vista, Goleta, Carpinteria and Santa Barbara. He hopes to expand his service by obtaining additional permits so he can sell his treats in Lompoc, Santa Maria, Paso Robles and other nearby places.</p>\n<p>Camacho likes to frequent the parking lot across the street from Wells Fargo, where other I.V. food trucks set up shop as well, to access students leaving or entering the university through the Pardall Tunnel.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual food Camacho sells, he now offers paletas, a Mexican frozen ice pop that usually comes in flavors like mango or strawberry.</p>\n<p>Despite his success with the launch of the food truck, Camacho still hopes to be able to sell on campus again.

Students live in I.V. for four to five years; they deserve to have their voices heard,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>The resolution writes that non-citizen resident status includes “visa holders, permanent residents, undocumented, and mixed status.”</p>\n<p>The Senate will only support these efforts if residents’ personal information and voting data will not be accessible to third parties such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (I.C.E.), and if any movements to extend voting rights to non-citizens does not negatively impact UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Residents of I.V. pay property taxes which fund local agencies including the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and local school districts, but only citizens can elect board members to these organizations.</p>\n<p>The issue of voting rights for non-citizens is personal for Cornejo.</p>\n<p>“As students and residents here we pay taxes … For some, you do have a vote on who you elect, for others, myself for instance, I do not,” Cornejo told the Senate during Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Measure R was cited as a reason for passing the resolution. Because non-citizens could not vote for this measure, which raised taxes for I.V. residents, “many students and UCSB community members [are] disenfranchised regarding their tax dollars,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>During discussion of the resolution, Cornejo cited the San Francisco Unified School District as an example of granting non-citizens the right to vote in District elections. In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition N, which extended voting rights in school district elections to non-citizens who are of legal voting age and are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 19 living in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are no resolutions to extend voting rights to non-citizens in I.V., and the path to extend non-citizens the right to vote is more complex than other cities because I.V. is unincorporated territory.</p>\n<p>According to Cornejo, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors would have to vote to declare I.V. incorporated territory. If I.V. was an incorporated territory, town representatives could add a resolution into I.V.’s bylaws granting non-citizens voting rights in local elections.</p>\n<p>As of 7 p.m. on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said he was not aware of the resolution and said he would have to consult I.V. CSD’s legal counsel before he could give a firm answer about what governing body would have the power to grant non-citizens local voting rights.</p>\n<p>“But in general, I support allowing undocumented people to vote in local elections. If you live here and pay taxes here, you should be able to participate in local decision making,” Brandt added in a statement to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Katherine Swartz is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD, pictured above, released a statement on Monday condemning the proposed Title IX changes. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The amendments, proposed by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, would narrow the definition of sexual harassment as well as limit the proceedings to live hearings, among other changes.</p>\n<p>The amendments would also allow educational institutions to dismiss cases of sexual and domestic violence that do not occur on campus premises, according to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/httpspence/status/1084870878024818689\">statement</a> issued by Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is “greatly concerned” about this proposed change due to the large number of students that live off-campus — I.V. alone is home to approximately 14,000 UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referenced statistics from the 2017-2018 school year, which stated that 376 students approached UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E) office to disclose that they had experienced “sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and/or had been stalked, either on or off campus, recently or in the past.”</p>\n<p>“The new standard will leave the door open for legal challenges that could encourage higher education institutions to look the other way when sexual and interpersonal violence occurs off campus,” the letter said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD also said fear and pressure can leave many students unwilling to file a report.</p>\n<p>“Reporting to Title IX will become much more difficult, and some cases [may] be ignored completely,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in a statement to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>With these new amendments, the I.V. CSD said it believes that even more cases could be left unreported, and students committing sexual and domestic assault could do so without facing disciplinary action from school administration.</p>\n<p>Brandt went on to highlight the ways that support groups on campus have worked to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing survivors of harassment and assault.</p>\n<p>“Survivor advocacy and support groups and political organizers, such as Students Against Sexual Assault, are doing excellent work bringing the lived experiences of survivors out of the shadows and into the light. Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration should be working with groups like them to reform Title IX policies, instead of right-wing special interest groups,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The University of California reflected <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">similar sentiments</a> regarding the proposed amendments, according to a press release sent out by Suzanne Taylor, the UC’s interim systemwide Title IX coordinator.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed concern that changes to Title IX would create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors and hinder the university administration’s ability to properly enforce Title IX.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal civil rights law enacted in 1972 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally-funded educational institutions. These regulations require administrators to take action in response to reported cases of sexual and domestic violence.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education encourages students, educators and community members to share their responses to the proposed amendments by Jan. 28.</p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal and Sean Crommelin are reporters for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

It’s a truly amazing experience and I’m blessed to have had it.”</p>\n<p>Jordan’s campaign in 2016 for a position on the Board focused on increasing safety in Isla Vista through securing more street lighting and parking for residents. Now, she says the past two years in her role were more about working with other board members to create the foundation of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and define its role for the public.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of it for me, was making sure that we were able to kind of set a precedent of what it meant to be on the Isla Vista Community Services District and setting a tone for the community as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Jordan participated in the CSD’s policy committee, which created governing documents for the functioning and mechanics of the Board as well as its interactions with the public and media.</p>\n<p>These policies helped to build the “baseline” for CSD’s growth and efficiency in the future, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>While Jordan says the CSD has made progress toward increasing safety in Isla Vista, lighting and parking projects never came into full fruition during her term.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD organized lighting walks and began discussion on lighting in I.V., but there is still work to be done before the community will enjoy additional lighting in the area, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>Increasing parking in I.V. also required a more lengthy and tedious process than anticipated, but as with lighting, Jordan hopes it will continue to be a priority for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s still a pressing need for our community but should be set as a long term goal,” Jordan said. “I think there are a lot of solutions to kind of take that on.”</p>\n<p>Among the accomplishments made toward increasing safety in the community, Jordan cited the collaboration made with UC Police Department for safety stations in I.V. and the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator as steps toward her overall term goals.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman on the board, Jordan said her perspective helped to shed light on safety concerns and issues faced by women in Isla Vista including sexual assault, catcalling and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“Of course I can’t speak for all women in any circumstance but I think the perspective I have as a woman in Isla Vista is really imperative… and being able to address those [concerns] from my perspective I think was really important and important for the board and our community to hear and understand,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Now that the board is without a female member, Jordan hopes that women in the community will pursue the opportunity to get involved with the board.</p>\n<p>“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also noted that her “frankness and honesty” during board meetings allowed her to contribute unique perspectives to discussions.</p>\n<p>“I’m never afraid to really speak my mind. I think that that’s a big part of what I brought to the board… a perspective that I had as a student, as a first-generation college student and a resident of Isla Vista,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Throughout her term, Jordan at times struggled to effectively divide roles and responsibilities among board directors, a challenge which she attributes to the initiative demonstrated by board directors.</p>\n<p>“I think all of us on the board are natural leaders and… everyone wants to take on as much as they can but I think being able to have us all kind of share in that responsibility is a really big part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, Jordan at times arrived late and left I.V. CSD Board meetings early or failed to show up at all, according to <i>Nexus </i>reporters who regularly attend the I.V. CSD meetings.</p>\n<p>Jordan said her absences were due to conflicts with her job as an event coordinator. When her work conflicted with I.V. CSD meetings, Jordan was obligated to attend her paying job over the meetings, which Board directors only began getting paid for last November.</p>\n<p>“I was responsible for paying for my own tuition, which is a big issue so as a full-time student I was also working around 55 hours a week,” Jordan said. “At the end of the day, I needed to make sure that I could pay for my school, which is the reason that I was here in Isla Vista in the first place.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During her term, Jordan oriented herself more toward university players and issues, but said that I.V. CSD could have benefitted from her developing more relationships with stakeholders in I.V. as well.</p>\n<p>“I was much more involved with university politics than I was more local and state, so I think that learning more about those key players and how I could’ve contributed to those conversations would have been meaningful to the board,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she fulfilled her role on the board to the best of her ability despite these difficulties. Overall, she said she is proud of the work she did while serving on the Board.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Jordan advises that the I.V. CSD maintains their obligation to the community as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“I think the only thing that we should be concerned about is continuing to serve the community and just always keeping that as our guiding force,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jordan believes the past two years have set up the board for success in the future.</p>\n<p>“I have very high hopes that this inaugural board was precedent setting for expectations for board members for years to come and also in creating relationships with community members and truly being a representative government.”</p>\n<p>For the next I.V. CSD Vice President, Jordan said that being open to the opinions and suggestions of others is vital to the position.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is coming into it with their own unique perspectives and everyone is coming into it with what they feel is the right thing to do,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Hearing people out is the most important thing you can do [when] trying to make an educated decision.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also said that I.V. CSD needs a vice president with a strong resolve and commitment to the community.</p>\n<p>“Somebody who [has] got a can-do attitude and has a little bit of grit. That’s what we need in Isla Vista. Somebody with grit and a willingness to get it done at all costs,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>After completing her master’s degree this June, Jordan hopes to obtain a job that provides her with the same motivation she found while serving on the I.V. CSD Board.</p>\n<p>“Being able to find a career that still gives me that meaning and driving force and willingness to go to work everyday is really important,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that eventually I’m able to come back to something like a local elected position because I really found a lot of purpose and meaning in that job as well.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1:07 p.m.]: An earlier version of this article said there were three empty seats on the board.

id=\"caption-attachment-85278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The organization was founded less than a year ago. <em>Courtesy of Nolan Fuss</em></p></div>\n<p>Greeks Go Green – a student-run organization focused on making Greek life more sustainable – was founded less than a year ago, according Kappa Alpha Theta member Miranda de Moraes, a third-year sociology and philosophy major.</p>\n<p>The organization is currently operated by two co-presidents: de Moraes and Dean Narlock, a third-year computer science major and Sigma Pi member.</p>\n<p>The farmer’s market, held between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m., featured a handful of campus organizations and local businesses from the greater Santa Barbara area: Blue Ridge Honey, I.V. Food Co-op, I.V. Trading Post, the Climate Reality Project, I.V. Surfrider and the Program for Assessment and Certification for the Environment and Sustainability (P.A.C.E.S).</p>\n<p>Some served various types of food, while others showed off art pieces and live music; all promoted “eating environmentally” and environmentally conscious attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to educate anyone [who came to our] event on how to choose your foods, whether you’re at the grocery store or a farmer’s market, and know the story behind everything you buy,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>De Moraes said the organization was first created to address the lack of sustainable practices in Greek life at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Greek life is a massive organization of people, and unless environmentalism is a top priority, it will inevitably generate a lot of waste due to the number of people involved,” she said.</p>\n<p>Greeks Go Green is officially recognized by UCSB due to its sponsorship by the Inter-Greek Council, allowing it to have its own budget, according to de Moraes.</p>\n<p>It is also entirely supported through donations and fundraisers, she said.</p>\n<p>“We did a restoration project with [the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration] and were able to raise $200 dollars from that by planting native plants and eradicating invasive ones,” de Moraes said.</p>\n<p>Projects generally take place within Greek life houses, focusing on sustainable practices such as “getting compost and recycling bins in the houses or reducing the use of styrofoam in the kitchens,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>According to Narlock, Greeks Go Green is divided into two subcommittees – projects and events – that plan accordingly in respect to the organization’s quarterly theme. This quarter’s theme was sustainable food consumption, promoted through Sunday’s event.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85279\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85279\" data-attachment-id=\"85279\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/greeks-go-green-hosts-farmers-market-promotes-environmentally-sustainable-practices/img_1990/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=1280%2C853&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,853\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_1990\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85279\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85279\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event also featured live music. Courtesy<em> of Nolan Fuss</em></p></div>\n<p>Narlock added that Sunday’s event was planned by the core executive council as well as the events committee.</p>\n<p>Last quarter, the organization’s focus was “on sustainable fashion,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with I.V. Trading Post to hold an inter-Greek clothing swap that was open to the community,” he said.</p>\n<p>De Mores noted that between 400 and 600 pieces of clothing were diverted from landfills simply through small donations during the event.</p>\n<p>Although relatively new, Greeks Go Green has made significant progress in making Greek life and Greek housing more sustainable with their composting project, de Mores said.</p>\n<p>For example, Greeks Go Green collaborated with Marborg Industries to create a food scrap collection program. She added that the goal of the program is to divert scraps and waste from participating chapter kitchens and turn it into mulch rather than trash.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to implement a food scrap collection program in several chapter kitchens, which is a big deal because around 40 people live in each chapter house. In most of them, there is a chef or kitchen staff of some sort that’s preparing the food for everyone in the house,” she said.</p>\n<p>“That staff is now diverting those pre-consumer food scraps from landfills by using this food scrap collection program we’ve implemented with Marborg, which is the county’s trash collection service. That compost is going to local orchards and farms in the area in the form of mulch.”</p>\n<p>The addition of a sustainability chair in all Greek houses, another key success to Greeks Go Green, provides each chapter with the opportunity and power to make changes regarding its environmental impact, Narlock said.</p>\n<p>In the future, he hopes to see a growth in support of Greeks Go Green with the addition of younger members to continue to promote environmental awareness after he and de Mores graduate.</p>\n<p>“Our big push through this year is getting some young energy involved in our group. Miranda and I are both juniors, so getting freshman and sophomores involved once we graduate is going to be a key focus for us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Now, this experience from her college years is just one of the reasons she changed her mind about the profession and decided to pursue a career in police work.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing how well you remember that and then you can’t remember what you had for dinner last night,” Avila said, adding that she still remembers the name of the officer whom she accompanied.</p>\n<p>Now, a decade later and recently named the first interpersonal violence investigator for Isla Vista, Avila brims with enthusiasm for her position and the community she works in.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and the UC Police Department <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">created the position</a> in late November. A contract signed by the two allocates funding to a peace officer designated to investigate crimes such as stalking, domestic abuse and sexual violence both on campus and in I.V. with the latter previously falling to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Avila has spent almost four years working at UCPD when she was hired in 2014 after working at Guadalupe Police Department.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman at Guadalupe PD for some time, Avila was often assigned delicate cases, such as child sex crimes, through which she began practicing some of the skills needed for handling interpersonal violence cases.</p>\n<p>Avila’s training also includes courses on numerous subjects, including human trafficking in minors, sexual assault, trauma interviewing and a drug endangered children course.</p>\n<p>Being a mother and a “people person” are qualities that Avila cites as making herself a qualified and strong investigator for Isla Vista, though she acknowledges that sometimes her passion for helping survivors can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I think I care too much. I get really attached to my survivors. I get really empathetic about their situation,” Avila said. “People might agree or disagree but I think that is a strength of mine.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of her position, Avila hopes to build trust between her and individual survivors as well as the general community of I.V. through community outreach, attending meetings and dispersing information about interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“I think in general when we humanize the form and the badge and the officer, that barrier diminishes a bit and people are more open to come up to us and inform us of things,” she said.</p>\n<p>The implementation of a police officer dedicated wholley to processing interpersonal violence cases is a victory to several groups and individuals in the community, such as Briana Conway [[ok]], director of Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.), and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</p>\n<p>Relationships between survivor advocacy groups like C.A.R.E. and STESA with UCPD are crucial for informing survivors of their options with cases and facilitating difficult processes involved in case investigation, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“When an advocate and law enforcement have a really smooth working relation, the likelihood that a survivor’s going to want to stay in that process is greatly increased,” she said.</p>\n<p>The position of the interpersonal violence investigator fills some of the “holes” that existed in the previous processes for handling interpersonal violence cases, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Efforts to solve cases are now more streamlined, reducing the number of times survivors have to tell their stories. Cases are also less likely to slip through the hands of officers who often have other cases that take higher priority.</p>\n<p>“To be able to have that compassionate connection to at least explain the legal process from their expertise could just be really helpful in the [survivor’s] decision-making process as well,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway has worked with Avila since she began at UCPD and describes her as an “incredibly kind and patient” officer.</p>\n<p>“I can say wholeheartedly, from how she treats survivors, [her work is] remarkable and wonderful, and survivors are in a much better place getting to speak to someone like her,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Despite her qualifications and support from community members, Avila acknowledges there are personal challenges that lie ahead in her demanding position. Being what she calls a “feeler,” Avila knows the realities of her job and her attachment to survivors takes a toll on her emotional health at times.

Rides can cost anywhere from $3 to $6.</p>\n<p>“We thought that same concept could be applied to food security, so we decided to lay out this idea where we create a page for grocery rideshares in the same format,” he said.</p>\n<p>CalFresh coordinator and fourth-year psychology major Stephanie Perez also provided pivotal direction in the implementation of the program.</p>\n<p>“When I applied for CalFresh, I got approved for the program … but there was another barrier that was stopping me from getting groceries: transportation,” she said.</p>\n<p>“This is something that we really need on campus – transportation for students that really need to go to the grocery store.”</p>\n<p>Despite several programs on campus that address food insecurity – such as the Associated Students Food Bank – transportation still remains a barrier for many students, Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“Getting to places like Costco, Albertsons and Trader Joe’s can be difficult if you don’t have a car,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Nadia Abushanab, a CalFresh advocate and third-year environmental studies major, the idea for the grocery rideshare was sparked during the Food Security Retreat at Hastings Nature Reserve that took place in September.</p>\n<p>“In [the retreat] we broke out into groups talking about different problems with food security that we want to address,” Abushanab said.</p>\n<p>Melanie Leung, a second-year environmental studies major, used the grocery rideshare group to carpool with three others to Sprouts and Trader Joe’s soon after the page was created.</p>\n<p>“I’ve only done it once, but so far it’s been a good experience,” Leung said. “I think it’s a great idea because I find it a waste of gas when I go get groceries alone and feel a little less guilty if I’m bringing others that need to go as well.”</p>\n<p>Perez had similar feedback about her experience with the rideshare group.</p>\n<p>“I can pay $5 for roundtrip, rather than paying Lyft $10 for one way and $10 for the other way,” she said. “As of now, the rideshare group has been effective for me and I’m glad we got it started.”</p>\n<p>Perez says there is potential in the future for the rideshare group to transform into a school-affiliated carpool system.</p>\n<p>“We hope there will be enough data from the rideshare group to show that there is a huge number of students who need rides and that transportation is stopping them [from] getting the proper nutrition that they need,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Eventually we want it to transform into something bigger where the school provides transportation for students to take them to the grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>Until then, the group hopes to increase its membership to benefit more of the UCSB community. The group currently has over 400 members.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to pick up momentum and hopefully the message will spread and people will want to engage,” Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mutually beneficial situation. We are very new, but we are hoping to expand a lot.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Coffee Organiks is simple: Coffee is delivered straight to a customer’s door anytime between 6 a.m. to 8:30 a.m Monday through Thursday, and 6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m Friday through Sunday, thus eliminating the inconvenience of idling at storefronts such as Starbucks or Caje for a morning cup of joe, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“If we can wake up Isla Vista with fresh coffee, deliver it to your door and cut out mediocre coffee that is victimizing our friends, then it’s a job well done,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Trump estimates roughly three to four pounds of coffee beans are brewed weekly to meet demands.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks starts their day earlier than most, preparing to wake I.V. by roasting fresh beans around 5 a.m. Cold brew is also “soaked in a sanitized vessel that extracts the flavor from the beans,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>“We pack our bags, put our earphones on and greet the person with their coffee.”</p>\n<p>Customers can order 16 oz. of hot or iced coffee for $3.50 and cold brew for $4, according to the company’s Facebook page. For 50 cents, customers can add hemp seed milk, almond milk or wildflower honey.</p>\n<p>All orders come with cane sugar and half &amp; half cream and customers who provide their own mug will receive 50 cents off.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks sources its beans directly from farmers Trump has personally engaged with while working on coffee plantations in Central America. Beans from countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and many others, have already made their way into the mugs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>Quality is the paramount aspect of Coffee Organiks and often a characteristic that is hard to come by in the coffee served in Isla Vista, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“[In I.V.] I don’t think there is anyone out there that can beat the quality of our coffee,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks’ first round of deliveries brewed more demand than expected. Trump noted in a Facebook post that the Peruvian blend sold out in a matter of three days.</p>\n<p>In addition to his Central American coffee blends, Trump is also looking to impress the caffeine-cravers of Isla Vista by securing an agreement with a chef in New York to expand Coffee Organiks’ menu to include domestic flavors as well.</p>\n<p>Trump has faith Coffee Organiks will continue to satisfy I.V.’s palate, adding they are “flirting with the idea of a coffee subscription” which would allow customers to have coffee delivered every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis for a discounted price.</p>\n<p>Also in the works along is an app, which would allow users to order coffee through their phones, he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks is not Trump’s first experience in caffeinated enterprises.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first introduction to the coffee industry was during a trip to Central America in 2012. During his time in Atenas, Costa Rica, Trump gained knowledge about the process of producing coffee beans while working at a coffee plantation owned by the Carlos family, a family he continues to source beans from for Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“I grew a stronger passion once I started working on the coffee fields,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>After returning to California to work as a chef for Google, Trump had a casual conversation about coffee with his roommates, which, after some experimentation and taste-testing, ushered the idea of a coffee delivery service into fruition.</p>\n<p>Trump came to UCSB after he was offered a scholarship in molecular biology. After only a year of being a Gaucho, he officially launched Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“Nothing is better than someone who takes a sip of our coffee and is immediately in a better mood,” Trump said when asked about his favorite part of the process.</p>\n<p>All products from Coffee Organiks are brewed in a sanitized kitchen under a food handler’s license.</p>\n<p>Orders can be placed at Coffee Organiks’ Instagram @Coffeeorganiks or on the company’s Facebook.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) began the memorial by reading the names of the 12 victims that were killed on Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>Meijer was also one of the organizers who helped plan the memorial, which was put on by the EVPLA office.</p>\n<p>Since Thousand Oaks is a little over an hour south of Santa Barbara, many UCSB students that are from the area attended the vigil with sorrow in their hearts.</p>\n<p>Alli Adam, an on-campus A.S. senator and someone who grew up in Westlake Village – a town that borders Thousand Oaks – spoke to the crowd, telling people to stick together even in hard times.</p>\n<p>“I have lived the past three years in Isla Vista but I spent the first 18 years of my life in Thousand Oaks. It’s very easy to blame and thus divide in times like these but I urge you to remember that we are one,” Adam said.</p>\n<p>Many faculty members, student leaders and fellow attendees shared the sentiment of the community helping to cope with the suffering that has hurt so many people.</p>\n<p>This shooting also resonates strongly in the I.V. community because of I.V.’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/backpacks-memorialize-victims-of-mass-school-shootings-across-u-s/\">own tragedy</a> in 2014.</p>\n<p>“It breaks my heart that we come together in this space [Love &amp; Remembrance Garden] near the benches in which each one is dedicated to one of the six victims of the Isla Vista tragedy in 2014,” Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Services District (CSD) secretary and fourth-year History of Public Policy major, said.</p>\n<p>Brandt was also quick to point out how frequent these shootings are happening and how big of a problem this country has.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We have seen far too many school children, university students, people of different faith, color, etc. killed by senseless gun violence… This does not need to be our future.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“A couple of nights ago one of the victims, by sheer coincidence, happened to be a survivor of the Las Vegas tragedy,” he said, referencing Telemachus Orfanos, a 27-year-old who died in the Wednesday night shooting.</p>\n<p>“When we live in a country where our citizens are at risk of not just being victims in one mass shooting but two and might not live we have a problem, a big problem.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand also shared the same sentiment as Brandt. He asked people to find a way to make a change in this system.</p>\n<p>“We go through this too many times, we have gathered at this beautiful garden too many times… The only way we are going to change this is by action, we cannot continue to do the same things and expect different results,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“We have seen far too many school children, university students, people of different faith, color, etc. killed by senseless gun violence… This does not need to be our future.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand listed out several things individuals can do to try and create change, such as voting, writing to a senator or having difficult conversations.</p>\n<p>He closed his statement by playing a rendition of “Imagine” by John Lennon, who he pointed out was also killed by gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Let’s imagine a world with no gun violence because we can accomplish it if we do it,” he said as he finished his cover.</p>\n<p>Despite how difficult the night was, several people said how happy they were that this community continues to come together during tragedy and how it eases the pain.</p>\n<p>“It is really easy to feel alone especially when you are away from home. It’s hard not being there when you find out your friends have passed away, but now we have [the vigil] right now and it helps,” Iris Renessen, second-year pre-biology major and Westlake Village resident, said.</p>\n<p>Adam said she was happy for everyone that showed up tonight, encouraging a sense of community during hard times.</p>\n<p>“I hope that this vigil gives you the healing and peace it has already brought me just standing here looking at my amazing community,” Adam said.</p>\n<p>“We are one community, one people and one country. Moving forward let us be kind to one another, let us remember that we are never too busy to give others a smile or ask how they are doing. Let us remember that we are in fact one.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
