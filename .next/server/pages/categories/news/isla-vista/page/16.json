On the listed dates, the Santa Barbara County Code prohibits outdoor festivals or any similar musical activity, defined as music played at any location not built exclusively for that purpose such as a concert hall or music venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current law sets an ordinance on April 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and Oct. 26 through Nov. 4, but it does not cover this year’s Deltopia weekend, which will take place April 7, 8 and 9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendment to the ordinance was initially proposed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Feb. 14 and would extend the days to include this year’s Deltopia as well as the following six years’ celebrations, including Halloween.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors meeting next week will determine the adoption of the bill. Board members must vote to pass the amendment, though it is likely to pass as all five members of the board voted in favor of setting the date for the hearing at Tuesday’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commander Kelly Moore of the Sheriff’s office spoke at the board meeting to discuss the amendment and said the previous two years’ Deltopia events saw much smaller crowds as a result of the festival ordinance. Commander Moore said the 2015 crowd was approximated to be 10,000 and the 2016 crowd was near 3,500, compared to 2014’s estimated 20,000 to 25,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. community members also spoke at the meeting, including I.V. Community Services District Director-elect Spencer Brandt, who said the festival ordinance is flawed but continues to be useful to law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The festival ordinance is an integral tool for the Sheriff’s Office and other partnering law enforcement agencies to make use of,” Brandt said. “While it is an imperfect solution, I see no reason why this policy shouldn’t be continued this year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution last week articulating the Senate’s position in favor of the amendment to the ordinance dates. Senator Batsheva Stoll, who authored the resolution, spoke at the board meeting to reiterate the Senate’s view on the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re in support of the ordinance as long as it’s being enforced on the day of Deltopia,” she said. “We want to make sure that, when it’s being enforced, it’s being enforced fairly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stoll said law enforcement’s presence at Deltopia could be a point of misunderstanding for students and stressed that police should work with campus organizations like UCIV to minimize potential conflict. UCIV is a volunteer organization at UC Santa Barbara that warns residents when they might be violating ordinances, connects students with medical services when needed and hands out free condoms and water during Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, there can be miscommunications with students and law enforcement, so we urge [law enforcement] to work with organizations like UCIV that volunteer to help students understand the law and kind of work as sort of a middleman to ensure that everything runs smoothly on Deltopia,” Stoll said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76078\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76078\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/","id":4442,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4441,4440,4439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Installation of Signals In Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County officials spoke at the A.S.

Senator Alex Giolito last week prompted county officials to come sooner.</p>\n<p>The petition calls for the termination of the project and urges alternative methods of controlling the intersection’s traffic flow to be considered.</p>\n<p>“I know they spent a lot of work on it and appreciate them addressing the current solution, but I believe alternatives can still be reached,” Giolito said.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Giolito said the signal would stop hundreds of bikes during rush hour and thus “clog” the intersection.</p>\n<p>McKarrell said Isla Vista Foot Patrol recognized the intense volume of traffic at the Pardall intersection almost a decade ago in 1998. However, it was not until 2007 that possible solutions were discussed. In 2013, county officials proposed the idea of a traffic signal.</p>\n<p>“I think it will actually help the bikes and pedestrians to all get through, and people will always know who has the right of way,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>Bert Johnson emphasized the simplicity of the traffic light’s design, noting that the signal would include an additional mast arm clearly visible to bikers so they will be able to see the signal before arriving at the intersection.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Giolito asked if county officials had considered the possibility of cars speeding on the six-and-a-half-block stretch of Embarcadero Del Norte, from Embarcadero Hall to Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the Santa Barbara Public Works Department has found that car speeds average around 29 miles per hour. He added that after the signal is installed, they will test the speeds again to ensure they do not exceed the 30-mile-per-hour range.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Aaron Hendizadeh asked the officials about how the new traffic light would be enforced.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, the I.V. Foot Patrol will initially implement a warning period for people who do not abide by the new traffic light. He said after a certain period of time, if people do not adhere to the signal, then enforcement will begin.</p>\n<p>McKarrell added, however, that the most important aspect of enforcing the signal is the safety of pedestrians and bikers at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“The only tools we have are educating the community on how to be safe and the other is enforcement,” McKarrell said. “The officers don’t want to come out here and start handing out citations. We have matters that are much more serious, but it is your safety that’s paramount.”</p>\n<p>The officials addressed alternative solutions to the signal, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or funneling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V.; however, all of these solutions were “too multilayered” to be deemed feasible.</p>\n<p>The officials suggested future discussions about the traffic signal closer to the beginning of the signal’s construction.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named A.S.

Community Services District (CSD), spoke at the meeting, saying the center has great potential to help I.V.</p>\n<p>“There are so many potential uses for the facility, and it can truly benefit the culture of Isla Vista, providing an outlet and a venue for positive activity,” he said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, an I.V. resident since 2011 and board director for the I.V. Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), spoke during public comment to thank board members who have previously supported I.V.’s attempts to establish the community center.</p>\n<p>“From the abolition of the development agency to the granting of $485,000 in support of critical renovations to the building, the board has proven a steady ally to the sizable community of Isla Vista,” he said. “For that you have our appreciation.”</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock went on to list the possible uses for the building if the grant was acquired and funds were allocated to the center.</p>\n<p>“I believe all the residents will benefit from the sense of knowledge and community that comes from classes such as dancing or cooking or by sweating out the stresses of work and studying during live music shows,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock also suggested the space could be used to host private events for a variety of members in the community, including quinceañeras and sorority and fraternity events.</p>\n<p>Skip Grey, assistant director of the Santa Barbara County General Services Department, is working on the application for the grant. Grey said that the grant will specifically be used for the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>Grey said his department began working on this grant in December, and the application has already been completed. The Board of Supervisors’ motion Tuesday now authorizes Grey to submit the paperwork. He said the application is complete and due to the state on Feb. 23.</p>\n<p>According to Grey, the grant is competitive and is not awarded automatically. The winners of the grant are expected to be announced by June 30.</p>\n<p>General Services partnered with the County Community Services Department to complete the application because of its authority over affordable housing programs. General Services will perform the renovations on the community center if the funding is approved, though the two departments worked together to complete the request for funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. qualified for the grant due the number of affordable housing units built in recent years.<br>\n“Specifically, the grant rewards cities and counties that approve affordable housing programs and the County of Santa Barbara has done a good job of that,” Grey said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, IVCDC and CSD board member, was not in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting but spoke to the Nexus on Monday to describe possible uses for the grant.</p>\n<p>If the grant was used to renovate the community center, Brandt said possible renovations could include replacing the roof of the building, creating a shade structure and possibly installing a garage-door-like opening on the side of the community center so that events could be held outdoors and indoors simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75795\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75795\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/","id":4435,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4434,4433,4432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Woman Sexually Assaulted on Estero Road","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","description":"A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police said the assault occurred when a woman who was lost walked into a residence on the 6700 block of Estero Road Saturday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to police, a male subject assaulted a woman at the residence that afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman was able to leave with the help of some friends, police said, and she reported the sexual assault to the I.V.

Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one.

Half of the funding will come from the public works department and the other half from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The project will begin in late summer, and the department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The county will determine a specific start date after removing pre-existing streetlight infrastructure at the intersection.</p>\n<p>Given the high traffic at the intersection, the construction will occur almost entirely on the sidewalk area. Some street shoulders are expected to be closed.</p>\n<p>The intersection has two stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic, giving eastbound and westbound traffic the right of way at all times.</p>\n<p>An increase in bike and car traffic over the years contributed to the change. Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, presented the project at an I.V. Community Network Meeting in January.</p>\n<p>“This project should provide a much more orderly and functional intersection, safely integrating bicycle, pedestrian and auto traffic,” George Thurlow, the university’s liaison for I.V. affairs, said.</p>\n<p>The original plan involved the installation of two traffic signals, one at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte and the other at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>The county determined that only one signal was necessary with the hope that the signal on Embarcadero Del Norte will cause sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic at the Embarcadero Del Mar intersection.</p>\n<p>The county also proposed a four-way stop and a roundabout for this intersection, but officials concluded that neither would be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes coming through the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to a traffic signal,” McGolpin said. “It will allow the bikes that are coming out of the campus to see the red bulb and slow down a little bit and allow the signal to go through a 15–20-second cycle. It’s definitely going to be new for I.V.”</p>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board chair and a 35-year I.V. resident, said she has noticed cars and delivery trucks having difficulty crossing while students ride their bicycles during the busiest times of the day.</p>\n<p>“Safety is the biggest concern,” she said. “Whatever is put there, I hope people are paying attention and being careful.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant.

Knew you’d be back again for the inside on catching the insides this weekend. Now, because of the overwhelming demand on my surf expertise, I have decided to bless ya with yet another completely accurate compilation of my surf report.

Oftentimes, rain means bacterial runoff being really present in the water during and after first day of rain. I know your surfing urges plunge you into the water despite possible sickness, but please be careful. Take care of yourself for finals, okay? Don’t say I never warned the freshies.

<em>Supriya Yelimeli/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police arrived at the residence at approximately 11:15 p.m. According to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), the person who made the report was “too afraid” to meet the police due to a large crowd of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officers cited several people at the party for alcohol violations, according to SBSO, and then noticed what appeared to be an active narcotics deal on a balcony, with one subject allegedly snorting a white powder off his hand and another suspected to be holding a bag of drugs.</span></p>\n<p>Suspects began resisting when deputies and officers attempted to detain them. The suspects also assaulted the police officers, SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said, and one officer sustained minor injuries that did not require medical attention.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One officer discharged a taser on a suspect before placing him in handcuffs and ankle restraints. An SBSO press release described some of the suspects as “extremely combative.”</span></p>\n<p>A total of three suspects were arrested after the incident. One was arrested for possession of cocaine, felony resisting arrest and assault on a peace officer. Another was arrested for assault on a peace officer, resisting arrest and possession of narcotics for sales.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last was arrested for resisting or delaying a peace officer while the first two suspects were being arrested. Due to an ongoing investigation, police have not released names of the suspects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who attended the party were leaning over a side barrier to observe the scene when police were arresting the suspects.

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The bluff was a communal backyard for the nine units on 6653 Del Playa Drive, known as The Oasis housing.</p>\n<p>After emergency personnel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-22/balcony-collapses-on-6653-del-playa-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">responded to the sudden collapse</a> Sunday, a Santa Barbara County building inspector determined that Units 1, 4, 5 and 9 would be evacuated to preserve the residents’ safety.</p>\n<p>Though the foundation of the building was unharmed, the four ocean-facing units were evacuated in preparation for emergency demolition — the first of many steps to scale back the Del Playa property before future cliff erosion.</p>\n<p>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals, purchased the building from Ed St. George in 1992. It was built in the early ‘70s and is among 38 buildings leased by the rental group.</p>\n<p>“None of my other properties are in any danger at all,” Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em>. “This was a total fluke.”</p>\n<p>The bluff collapsed on the day of a heavy storm, and though there was no damage to the actual residence, Del Playa Rentals returned the evacuated residents’ security deposits, last month’s rent and partial January rent.</p>\n<p>Residents were initially given until Friday to find new housing, but Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that the county Building &amp; Safety Department red-tagged the units for Thursday, giving students one less day to relocate.</p>\n<p>No one was injured in the bluff collapse, but “if anyone was going to be hurt on that patio, it would have been me,” Gelb said, adding that he conducts very frequent inspections of all of his housing units.</p>\n<p>Currently, Gelb has filed an emergency demolition permit for the evacuated units. Santa Barbara County will approve the permit, and Gelb said County Building &amp; Safety Manager Massoud Abolhoda intends to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>The Building &amp; Safety Department is responsible for approving the permit within 30 days, and Gelb said he will continue to cut back his properties to account for future deterioration of the I.V. cliffside.</p>\n<p>The entire Del Playa bluff is vulnerable to erosion, Abolhoda said, and the county conducts inspections of the rock face after every major storm.</p>\n<p>The last building inspection was in August, and though the county knows the “setback of every building” in Isla Vista, Abolhoda said events like Sunday’s emergency could not be predicted.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing you can do to avoid it,” he said, adding that there are inherent risks to living on cliffs in I.V. The county could not determine exactly how much of the Del Playa backyard fell into the ocean, but it is estimated to be more than five feet.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75253\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1883960290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75245\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75253\" data-attachment-id=\"75253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/2017-01-23_stephenmanga_6653dp-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"676,784\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75253\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=676%2C784\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"784\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?w=676&amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exposed rounded concrete cement poles in a house adjacent to the balcony collapse reveal the extent of cliffside erosion on Del Playa Dr. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Del-Play-Bluff-Policy-Revised-February-2016-2-1.docx\" target=\"_blank\">county figures</a>, the rate of I.V.’s bluff erosion is “a source of debate,” but the bluff is retreating on average six inches a year. In extreme conditions like a storm, a cliffside can crumble by as much as a foot.</p>\n<p>If California building codes were applied in I.V., the foundation of a home would have to be at least 40 feet away from a descending slope. The county says in its documents, however, that “several geotechnical and geological studies” in I.V. have determined that a building only needs to be 15 feet from the cliff.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of a landowner to determine that a building’s foundation makes a home “safe and habitable,” according to county codes. The foundation of the building was unaffected by the bluff collapse, Gelb said, adding that resident allegations saying the foundation had cracks in recent months were unfounded.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Gelb said he has cut back 15 of his residences to prevent damage and injury from future cliff erosion. “I’ve done everything proactively,” he said, adding that other landlords in I.V. have also begun replacing oceanside units further back from the cliff.</p>\n<p>Students who were evacuated from 6653 Del Playa Drive will be forced to find alternate housing by Thursday, and others are still shaken from what they described as the sounds of a “massive earthquake” on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Several former residents who were contacted by the <em>Nexus</em> throughout the week were unable to respond, saying they were in the process of moving furniture, belongings and signing leases for new housing.</p>\n<p>UCSB is offering housing in Tropicana Student Living for up to two groups of seven students, and the off-campus apartment complex also has room for individual students.  The University will not be covering the housing costs, but the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships may be able to provide emergency grants or loans.</p>\n<p>“It seems that both the university and Tropicana each have enough space to accommodate all of the displaced students, so there should be no difficulty for any of these students in quickly finding alternative places to live,” Andrea Estrada, UCSB’s spokesperson, said.</p>\n<p>Several former Del Playa residents are searching for non-university housing in I.V., and the street-facing units are still occupied.</p>\n<p>According to Abolhoda, the street-facing units are “as safe as any other building anywhere else,” barring an emergency situation like an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The former residents will be safe entering their homes to retrieve their belongings, Abolhoda said, but residents at Unit 9 will not be able to enter the home due to a staircase that was compromised after the bluff collapse.</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the I.V. Tenant’s Union (IVTU), said the “situation is still evolving” daily with information from Del Playa Rentals. Unander said it is too early to determine if there is any legal ground for a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“There is not a lot of other compensation that they would be entitled to at this point, and we need to see where all of the dust settles,” she said.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Senate also discussed a resolution in support of the displaced residents, asking that IVTU provide up to $300 per student for moving costs and ensure that the students have legal representation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75245\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75245\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/","id":4464,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4463,4462,4461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Free food, chocolate tastings, and more this week in I.V.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>SPECIAL MEETING</strong><br>\nThere is a special meeting of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District’s Adhoc Grants Committee at 8 a.m. at the IVRPD District offices at 961 Embarcadero Del Mar.
