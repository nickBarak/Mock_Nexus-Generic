The branch received a grant from the </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the summer 2018 to help gather data on library needs for Zone 4 — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/rezoning-will-provide-i-v-with-more-library-access/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a library service area that includes Goleta and I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to library technician Marie Crusinberry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here to have a conversation to better understand your aspirations for the community,” Crusinberry told the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry began by asking the directors what they would want for I.V., bringing up the idea of a local branch in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand stressed the importance of children’s programs for I.V., along with language access programs, which provide translation and interpretation services, and technology access programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen and Board President Spencer Brandt both suggested library service ideas geared toward college students. While Nguyen proposed extended hours at the Goleta Valley Library during exam weeks to give students another study space, Brandt spoke about possibly increasing the number of common college textbooks and course reserves for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say it’s a biology class or that you’ve got 700 people in this lecture hall. It’d be great to keep some reserves of those types of textbooks and make those accessible to students,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that that really will help in terms of making the project a success by bringing the college students in and having that community atmosphere that’s all inclusive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President Robert Geis raised his concerns over the divide between I.V.’s youth and the Goleta Valley Library, citing the physical distance between the two as a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The library’s really important to those young kids, so how do we get either library services here or get [kids to a library]? My idea is to get them to the library,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry recommended three possible initiatives to get the I.V. community involved in the Goleta Valley Library: a bookmobile, a branch in I.V. or a direct bus shuttle connecting I.V. and the library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bookmobile would be able to bring books directly to I.V. This would allow people to check out or return books easily, without having to go to the library — something that Crusinberry suggested when addressing Director Jay Freeman’s idea for a book drop-off in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has not had a bookmobile since its former one was sold years ago, according to Crusinberry. However, she says the option has resurfaced and is being discussed again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a library branch in I.V. was highly supported, it was seen as a long-term project with obstacles. Director Bertrand did note that the opening of the Isla Vista Community Center in August might be able to provide a space for library programs but the bookmobile and bus shuttle were seen as more immediate solutions to bring library services into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board seemed to favor a direct bus shuttle from I.V. to the library in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD). Director Bertrand stated that a shuttle to the library will be something he plans to address with SBMTD at a later date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just trying to learn and get information because there has been talk about the underserved in I.V. But we need to understand what that means. You can’t just say, ‘Well, we want a library.’ There’s a lot as far as what you want,” Crusinberry said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to make sure that we have our data that shows what we should be doing with our money that we have.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

be. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Coffee Company; Sam and Luke’s, named for their kids; or Moose, for their dog, were were a few of the names they pitched to their friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But ultimately, they settled on Campus Point Coffee, a nod to the beach by the UC Santa Barbara Chi-5 freshmen dorms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more we came up with names and bounced them off our friends, Campus Point just kind of stuck. We really felt like we wanted something that identified with the local town,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You could name it anything; I bet you there’s probably a randomizer on Google that will give you different names. But we wanted to come up with something that was kind of a flag post saying, ‘We’re a part of this community.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson, who grew up in Santa Barbara and graduated from UCSB in 2001, said he had always been interested in owning “something in Isla Vista.” When he saw the location was available, he said he knew he had to go for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This [space] was a big part of my life when I was at UCSB when I was here, and it’s such a great spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s vision for Campus Point Coffee is simple: He wants Isla Vistans to use the space as a place to come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson referenced Java Jones, which occupied the space before Coffee Collaborative, and how the shop fostered a feeling of community — one he wishes to replicate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Back in the late ‘90s, early 2000s … [there] were places in I.V. that were just like the space where your crew met. It was either Java Jones, or I.V BC, which was Isla Vista Brewing Company before it became a lecture hall. Or Deja Vu, or Woodstock’s, Freebirds, but there was a spot that was like wherever you met or hung out, that was the spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be that spot for people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson believes one of the biggest advantages the shop has in creating that atmosphere is the amount of space they have to accomodate customers. In addition to a large seating area indoors, they also have generous patio space, he noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other coffee shops in the area, Nelson wants Campus Point Coffee to have “killer WiFi” and late hours, but says the store will be “very responsive to the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson wants to be proactive about asking the community for feedback, particularly in the store’s first few months of being open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tentative opening day for the shop is Aug. 1, although Nelson said that’s more of a goal than a firm date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until then, Nelson will be working on finalizing hires, training the staff and finishing up the remodeling of the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson and his wife are opening up the coffee shop in the same space where Coffee Collaborative used to be.

But with the help of perfect timing and a movie that changed her mind, Xu decided to open her wallet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a Korean movie about policemen who watch drug dealers from a fried chicken place across the street. The fried chicken place was about to close down, so they bought the place to watch the drug dealers,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, Xu offered to purchase Sweet Alley from Sun on a whim, who had been struggling to find a new owner for months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw [Sun’s] advertisement, and then the next day, I asked him if [Sweet Alley] is still on the market. He said, ‘Yes.’ And then the next day, I gave him the deposit.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With renovations set to begin next month, Xu wants to welcome customers with a completely new interior. On top of selling the frozen yogurt equipment, she plans to tear down old walls and refurnish the entire store; she is also flirting with obtaining a light liquor license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internal wall will be knocked down and moved further back, and I’ll add a small countertop so this whole area can be a sitting area,” she said, pointing to the concrete slab where customers used to walk up to get their frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and dessert are also on Xu’s short list of amenities to include at her Vons, on top of the boba she plans to bring daily from Phresh Teas, a restaurant of hers dedicated to serving a variety of different tea creations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the unit’s small footprint, Xu estimates she will need roughly half the amount of employees she has staffed at her other restaurants. Instead of hiring former Sweet Alley employees, Xu said she will be “pick[ing] from Uniboil staff” and offering them a spot at the new store. Xu expects Vons will be managed by the wife of the current Uniboil head chef.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure authenticity, Xu said Vons flies trainers directly from South Korea to host trainings for employees whenever a new store opens — a franchise policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Uniboil, which follows a more traditional restaurant style, Xu plans to make Vons more expedient so customers can just “grab and go.” If a customer simply wants to buy food and leave, Xu estimates they can be on their way in as little as 10 minutes. If customers would like to stay and eat, however, they’ll have plenty of time to choose when to come in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, I’m thinking Monday through Thursday, we’ll do 3 o’clock to 11 o’clock and 3 o’clock to two in the morning Friday through Sunday,” Xu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If fried chicken isn’t enough to fill customers’s stomachs, Xu said desserts will be available as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be selling boba cake — a milk tea cake with boba on it — and also coconut jellos, which is made of coconut juice and real coconut with jello inside. We’ll also be selling Hong-Kong style desserts and street food,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further impress palates, Xu said she is working with a local chef who is skilled in making authentic “Chinese street snacks.” She said the chef currently works from home and only delivers food from his house. If everything goes according to plan, Xu said, those street snacks may soon be on Vons’ menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu also plans on developing a “really strong delivery system.” Not only will this allow Vons to serve food beyond its own walls, but it will also help the store remain competitive, as most restaurants in I.V. offer some form of delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has a lot of work ahead of her in the coming months, Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store, which will be sometime in the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, Xu said Vons will be the sole restaurant in I.V. where customers can sink their teeth into Korean-fried “flats” and “drums” — the industry-standard cuts of chicken that are commonly fried into delicacies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no good fried chicken around here. We only have KFC — not even a Popeyes or Wingstop. We don’t have anything. That’s why I think this will be a really good idea for a chicken place,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Barthelemy began to curate these objects to preserve them in the weeks following the tragedy for a public exhibit that would be ready by the first anniversary of the tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 10 weeks of exhibition at Old Gym, all of the objects were archived on the Special Collections section of the Davidson Library, located on the third floor. But it wasn’t until this past year that an online collection of the exhibit began to gain momentum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five-year project culminated this Wednesday with “We Remember Them: Acts of Love and Compassion in Isla Vista,” where the exhibit’s new website was unveiled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://islavistamemorialproject.omeka.net/exhibits/show/werememberthem\">website</a> is a recreation of the original exhibit, meant to be seen room by room, and allows users to search for specific remembrance items with detailed information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lauren Trujillo, a library and information science masters student at UC Los Angeles, played a key role in helping the Isla Vista Memorial Project come to fruition. She first became involved in the project as a second-year student at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo began working on the project because of her interest in archiving, she also had a personal connection to the Isla Vista tragedy; as a member of Delta Delta Delta, commonly known as Tri Delta, Trujillo was a close friend of victims Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I] wasn’t sure if that would be too personal for me, but I knew I had to do it. I had to be the voice for my sorority sisters, I had to be the voice for undergraduate students and get our stories straight from what the media had torn apart … so taking it back was something that I could help with this narrative,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Trujillo has been creating a website for the Isla Vista Memorial Project to commemorate the fifth year anniversary and received funding through a year-long grant at UCLA from the Mellon Foundation to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trujillo’s aim with the online exhibition was to allow people to access the materials at a time when they were ready to address what was a highly traumatic event, especially for alumni who had been around in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that other students weren’t ready to go through the exhibition yet. They weren’t ready to readdress that trauma again,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted the importance of educating students who weren’t here for the tragedy on how the community came together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can find the details of what happened that day on the Internet, but you can’t find how our community reacted and all the great things that came out of this unspeakable event … for them to see our community’s story and how UCSB and how Gauchos reacted and how we came together can help them understand the campus they belong to and the campus that they are contributing to,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original Isla Vista Memorial Project, as well as its new website, show I.V. in a different light compared to media’s response to the Isla Vista tragedy, Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The news just grabs any photo [they] can get, which is whatever happens to be on your Facebook profile at that second. And so, for the families not to be able to choose the photograph they want to represent their loved one is a really big deal,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project gave those families the opportunity to choose a picture of their loved one, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can imagine that was really emotional for them to go through photographs and choose one, and it was emotional for us too,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Isla Vista Memorial Project evolved over the past five years, Barthelemy and Trujillo’s work to memorialize the tragedy has grown. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barthelemy became the official liaison between the university administration and the families of the victims, a position she said is unique to UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now, Barthelemy said she is ready to hand some of the responsibilities over to UCSB administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to develop really close relationships with the family… [but] I’m going to just be able to focus more on my history work and not so much the administrative stuff, but I want the families to be very well taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Trujillo, continuing work on the Isla Vista Memorial Project was a way to continue healing after the loss of her friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing that I had to realize was that trauma, you never get over it, and I had to accept that. I’m never going to get over this. So sometimes when I’m working with an object or if I see something and it makes me cry, it’s okay and I can let it out,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But then the next day, and another day, I can continue working with these things and feel like I’m doing this for a bigger reason.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Platoff, UCSB librarian and Isla Vista Memorial Archive curator, told the audience at the opening of the exhibit on Wednesday night that working on such a personal exhibit has led to a greater political energy for those working on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can be professional in your daily work with the materials, but we are also people with opinions who read and participate in our community … when I leave the library at night, I’m political,” Platoff said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo is proud of the work she has done, she said she sometimes harbored guilt about the shootings that have occurred since Isla Vista’s own tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt guilty that we could have done more in 2014, and [I] should have gone out and started speaking and done more to make them stop happening,” Trujillo said. “Hopefully by sharing this online exhibition and by sharing these items in a university space, we can start conversations and we can inspire action of some sort … [these shootings] need to stop and it’s been re-traumatizing every time another community’s affected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m blessed for what I’ve been able to do, but I do feel the sense to do more.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heather Carr contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When going forward with the planning of this, I really wanted to just make it a space of memorial and remembering,” said Jeike Meijer, former Associated Students (A.S.) external vice president for local affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office has been working on recreating the original memorial events that students put together in the aftermath of the shooting. One of those recreations included putting up posters of the original blackboard messages that students left for the victims in 2014 by the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re basically replicating that this year because we wanted to bring back the initial reaction and memory of the five year anniversary,” Meijer added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vigil and walk from Storke Tower to Anisq’Oyo’ Park <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/281778196041141/\">taking place</a> on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. is also a tribute to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-25/isla-vista-community-gathers-to-mourn-share-memories-of-those-lost/\">initial vigil</a> that took place two days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president for the I.V. Community Services District, spoke about how I.V.’s  high turnover rate means it can be harder for students to learn about the tragedy when they first come to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My generation of students wasn’t here for the tragedy. And we were the ones who sort of were watching from a distance. I know I remember the day that it happened, I remember reading about it on the news and actually talking about it with my friends just because the details were so horrific,” said Brandt, who will graduate this spring with the class of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we keep talking about it and that we keep recognizing just the horror of what happened, because it is so important to how our community has developed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the sorority Delta Delta Delta, more commonly known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/tri-delta-to-suspend-operations-at-end-of-school-year/\">Tri Delta</a>, closing down at the end of this year and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/coffee-collab-mural-commemorates-tragedy/\">Coffee Collaborative</a>’s future uncertain, I.V. is losing some of the physical markers of remembrance people once used to learn about the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the months after the shooting, a memorial swing bench honoring two Tri Delta sisters who lost their lives in the shooting, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper, was given to the Tri Delta house. Coffee Collaborative has a mural dedicated to the six victims and has intentionally left a bullet hole in the window from that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every four years, we have almost an entirely new town in terms of the population and who lives here,” Brandt said. “I’ve been happy to see that at least in the instance with the Tri Delt bench that it’s found a home </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last that I heard </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with parents of one of the victims.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the student population at UCSB essentially resets every four years, many staff and faculty members who were here in 2014 are still here today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life, has been working at UCSB for 28 years and has worked to help the community heal for the past five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time this year, Armistead said, the Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (A.S.A.P.)  is putting together <a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/events/asap-may-23-iv-tragedy-commemoration-and-reflection-five-years-later\">an event</a> for staff members to “reflect, connect and nourish.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event is described as an informal space for staff and faculty members to come together and will be facilitated by A.S.A.P. Manager Kirsten Olson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t feel as cohesive because now we’ll be with students who are honoring and respecting and remembering, but they weren’t necessarily here,” Armistead said. “And so this space created for staff and faculty is pretty special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, arrived on campus during Fall Quarter 2015 and said it has “been a learning process for [her] in terms of what were the impacts and how have those changed over time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. might be losing some of its physical reminders of the tragedy, Klawunn pointed to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/\">lights in Pardall Tunnel</a>, which were installed as part of a memorial project in 2015, and the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/\">Love and Remembrance Garden</a> in I.V. as examples of how the community has created its own ways to remember and honor the victims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to acknowledging the experiences of faculty and staff members who were here in 2014, Meijer touched upon the experiences of the first responders who were there as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] some of them, that’s the worst night of their life. They were the ones there; they were the ones who were seeing everything happen,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As two students who weren’t at UCSB in 2014, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel said she and Meijer had been speaking to people who were at the university and could talk about the ways in which the community came together in the days after the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bringing that community back together when you’re remembering is really important and making sure that that legacy and that history is being passed down so that no new generation of UCSB students ever forgets what happened,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said that while people would talk about the shooting during the year, there wasn’t a “place to center yourself and focus on remembering the people’s lives” outside of the annual vigils.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to keep reminding students that this tragedy happened in their community just five years before is by holding these vigils and memorial events, Kopel and Meijer both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t want to present it in a way that’s gonna make people not want to see it or not want to remember, because healing in that way is always so hard,” Kopel said. “But I think that just by people walking past those boards, for example, maybe first years, they’re gonna stop and see it and they make initial contact with it once and they’re gonna now know that for the rest of their four years here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It really only takes one instance of contact or a story passed down or knowledge passed down for that to continue on. And I don’t think that people in this community are ever gonna forget that this happened.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

from the tragedy in a positive manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, the Beloved Community Project began working toward that goal by hosting a two-day conference in I.V. with the hope to “bridge all parts of the community,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the conference — which took place in six different locations in I.V. — was a major stepping stone in the Beloved Community Project’s development and was sponsored and funded by over 30 different local organizations, including I.V. Youth Projects, St. George Family Youth Center, I.V. Food Co-op and I.V. Recreation and Parks District.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one segment of the conference titled “I.V. Talks,” Collins Puente said “elders in the community, houseless members of the community and youth of the community” all spoke to their experiences in I.V. while “working toward a common goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her most memorable experience with the Beloved Community Project took place during Fall Quarter 2018, when Meijer —  in collaboration with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Beloved Community — went door-to-door in I.V. and distributed the tote bags as a way to “introduc[e] people to their neighbors and Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other goods, each tote bag contained an “Isla Vista guide” with letters written by local middle school students. The letters asked that college students acknowledge the middle school students in the community and addressed “how to take care of this community for everybody,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88557\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-88557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88557\" data-attachment-id=\"88557\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"People_s Park_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE (6)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88557\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Collins Puente finds that taking care of the community does not always involve an event of its own. She said the “porous” nature of the project allows it to foster change in other forms as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re feeling like we’re making a connection with a person that feels much closer to their own idea of community, then that is actually the product we want at the end of it … Our process is our product,” Collins Puente said about the core philosophy of the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she draws from that philosophy for motivation to maintain the project and foster new initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a part of the Beloved Community Project is simple, Collins Puente noted — when living in I.V., “there is no membership.

apartment building. </span><em>Courtesy of I.V. CSD</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BigSpeak CEO Jonathan Wygant and Anacapa Development owner Terry Huggins are interested in redeveloping the area to increase the amount of affordable housing in I.V. as well as to create more startup/incubator spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant, whose family owns Embarcadero Hall and has a financial agreement with UC Santa Barbara that ends in 2026, said he and his siblings felt that the building could be better utilized than as just a lecture hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant and Huggins were both familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/successor-agency/isla-vista-master-plan.sbc\">Isla Vista Master Plan</a>, “a planning document for the Isla Vista area which sets forth community goals and policies to guide the future growth of Isla Vista,” and felt there was an opportunity to further develop the community, starting with the Loop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After surveying the area, the two said they wanted to create “something that could serve the community at a higher level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed renovations involve turning the Embarcadero Hall lot into an apartment building. The two would then renovate the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naan Stop, Dumpling King, Deja Vu and Rosarito </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to a multi-story building with a lecture hall, restaurants, co-working offices and startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building where the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) currently holds its meetings, 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, would become another multi-use building, housing a new I.V. Community Center and the I.V. CSD offices on the bottom floor and apartments on the upper floors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final building that Wygant and Huggins want to renovate is the current I.V. Community Center building, which is already under renovation by the I.V. CSD. Wygant and Huggins would relocate the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic to the first floor of this building, and then fill the rest of the bottom floor with restaurants. The upper floors would be more startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think that with everything that’s going on, particularly in the hard sciences out of UCSB, it could be a great place to start a business in collaboration with one of the departments or several of the departments over at UCSB,” Huggins said. “And there really isn’t anything like that in Isla Vista right now. But we’d like to provide it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins added that the new spaces would incentivize recently graduated students to stay in I.V. because of the businesses as well, although Board Director Jay Freeman questioned whether the two had actually done research on the demand for tech companies in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two envision all of the buildings to be four stories tall, but said none of them would exceed 45 feet in height. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between the three buildings located on the Embarcadero Del Mar side of the Loop, Huggins envisions a considerable amount of patio space, where students can “sit outside and have a cup of coffee.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant don’t currently own the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar, Huggins said he was “working on something.” Since the proposal is still in very early stages, Huggins said he didn’t want to take action on possibly purchasing other buildings in the Loop just yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not trying to replace the established places that people like to go in Isla Vista to eat or drink. We just want to redevelop this in a way that adds to the community rather than takes away from other people’s businesses,” Huggins added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two also believe that retail around this area would be “really revitalize[d]” by the renovations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant stressed the community benefits of the renovations, the proposal met backlash from the packed room, with several long-term residents and community members expressing concern about the potential loss of public spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone’s gotta say something you guys,” Pegeen Soutar, vice chairperson of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and a resident of I.V. for 35 years, said, kicking off public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spent some time with both these gentlemen and I’ve tried to go into things with an open mind and my concern is always for the community, but I have concerns about even this variation of the plan,” Soutar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a community center finally; after many, many years, it’s going to be open in August. We’ve been waiting 40 years for this and I think it’s going to be beautiful…I think it’s going to be what we need and it’s a great start for us. If somewhere in the future we decide we need more space, when we’ve proven that we’ve burst out of the doors of that one, then I think that’s something that we as a community can discuss,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, I’m not, right now, seeing a benefit to the community to put things on hold or to change things that already exist right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar also pointed out the lack of parking allocation in the plan or any research on the environmental impact of having more people frequenting the Loop. Soutar said she respected the two for reaching out and asking the community for feedback, but said “at this point, I’m so excited for what we have already.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen echoed Soutar’s comments, pointing out that having that many UCSB students on that side of the Loop would cause a slew of traffic problems for cars, bikers and pedestrians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another community member stood up, pointed at the proposal sketch and dryly said, “Welcome to Los Angeles, eventually.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once public comment was over, the I.V. CSD returned to its discussion and questioning. All the board members expressed concern with I.V. losing the public spaces that it very recently created for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSD Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he was uncomfortable with the idea of people coming in from the outside and changing the landscape of I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a process of questions, and questions are important. But there is also a visceral reaction that I’m sure some of us in this room have which is somehow beyond those questions,” Hedges said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At least three of us remaining on the board sit here because… one of our taglines was ‘nothing for us without us.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Visioning is something best done by those who will live out that vision rather than those who have good ideas from the outside. That’s not to say that good ideas can’t come from outside,” Hedges said. “But I’m not ready for this, I’m really not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins and Wygant plan to take all the feedback they received into consideration before deciding how they want to proceed. They both anticipate being present at future I.V. CSD meetings and will continue speaking with community members about how to make their proposed renovations more community-friendly.</span></p>\n<div class=\"_3_bl\">\n<div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\">\n<div class=\"_4gx_\">\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"_1aa6\"><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The trek out to the edge of town is certainly worth it to dance to some head-banging tunes. Grab your bedsheets and fashion yourself a makeshift toga and get ready to jam out to Careless Cub, The Mallards, Delta Dagger, Odd Army and tons of other talented local bands. Located at 850 Camino Lindo, come make the most of your Saturday and forget about real clothes. Togas are cooler. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/2210695989007770/\"><b>Sick Epic Party Concert</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have the chance to see a concert for the same price of a Yerba Mate, you simply cannot pass it up.

General Manager Troy Yamasaki, the new shop, located at 416 E Haley St., is revolutionary in its progressive steps toward reducing waste.</p>\n<p>“We are unique in that we don’t have any single-use to-go cups or single-use to-go anything,” Yamasaki said. “At Cajé in I.V. we understand that students are busy and have to run, but we do have a lot of consumer waste there.”</p>\n<p>“With us having the opportunity to open a shop with an entirely new concept, we thought that we should take a step in the right direction for the environment and cut down on our use of single-use plastic cups,” he added.</p>\n<p>The downtown Cajé relies on what is known as an “exchange program” as an alternative to single-use cups. Customers pay a deposit to use a reusable cup, which is repaid when the cup is returned.</p>\n<p>“We have an exchange program, so it is $5 for a hot cup and $2 for a Mason jar, and you pay that deposit and you get your order in a reusable cup,” Yamasaki said. “If you give it back to us, we give you [the deposit] back.”</p>\n<p>In contrast to the I.V. location, the downtown location will be a Prohibition-era themed bar beginning at 5 p.m. The bar, called Lab Social, is a speakeasy-style bar, meaning that it is hidden from public view.</p>\n<p>“[The bar] is supposed to be slightly incognito,” Yamasaki said. “It is a trend that a lot of bigger cities are doing, where instead of just being a bar with the front door open, it’s a bar that is kind of hidden within another store or hidden from plain sight.”</p>\n<p>The front door will be locked at nights, and customers will have to find their way into the bar through the back entrance, according to Yamasaki.</p>\n<p>Other differences between the I.V. location and the new Cajé downtown revolve around the menu.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, we have bagels, acai bowls and smoothies,” Yamasaki said. “[Downtown], our menu right now is consisting of a tortilla española and an avocado toast, which is different than the location in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the downtown Cajé has formed a collaboration with Sama Sama Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant, to diversify Cajé’s menu. According to Yamasaki, the menu is expected to grow, with the full version to be rolled out come grand opening, pending a time and date to be determined.</p>\n<p>“The space is beautiful, and we are really excited to provide a downtown haven for our regulars in Cajé Isla Vista as well,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate all the love and support we have received so far. It’s actually been ridiculous how many regulars from our current location came out to show some love and some support. There is just a lot of gratitude here for that loyalty.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

The case alleges that Shehadeh owes Icon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ikes-lawsuit.pdf\">more than $42,000 in overdue rent</a>, according to public records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reached out to both Icon’s leasing office and its legal team several times, but did not receive any comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a separate interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shehadeh said he recently filed a countersuit against Icon, alleging that “[Icon] did some things that we didn’t appreciate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh’s countersuit alleges that Icon breached his lease agreement and committed fraud in the form of concealment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a court document sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Shehadeh’s attorney, the countersuit alleges that Icon hid important information following a situation involving mold on the premises, resulting in the eventual litigation currently taking place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After informing Icon in January of 2018 that he would no longer be leasing the store, “Icon negotiated with Ike’s Place to amend the lease” and remain in I.V., according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that following the repair of a faulty hose in the soda dispenser at the I.V. location, Icon, “unbeknownst to Ike’s Place… hired ATC Group Services LLC to perform a mold inspection in the neighboring property…” that same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that same week, ATC Group Services allegedly reported that the mold found on the premises was coming from Shehadeh’s store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report claimed that the faulty hose was to blame for the mold but, allegedly, nobody from ATC Group Services contacted the store to inform Shehadeh there was a presence of mold on the premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the court document alleges that Icon had knowledge of mold on the premises prior to the faulty hose in the I.V. location’s soda dispenser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soda dispensary machine at the I.V. location had allegedly been inspected just “weeks prior” and the health inspector “did not find any issues with that machine,” according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Shehadeh entered negotiations between Jan. 19 of 2018 and Jul. 4 of 2018 to extend his lease with Icon, the leasing agency allegedly “did not disclose this mold report to Ike’s Place,” according to the court document: “had Ike’s Place known that Icon intended to blame mold damages in the Premises upon Ike’s place, then Ike’s Place would have been able to obtain contemporaneous evidence that it was not responsible for said damages.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh eventually decided to terminate his lease with Icon during the negotiation period but received an email in which Icon offered to “modify the amendment for the reduced gross rent,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within weeks, Shehadeh agreed to extend the lease, ending negotiations with Icon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegedly, “almost immediately” after Shehadeh signed the extended lease, Icon began inspections to “establish the presence of mold that it was already aware existed but had not disclosed to Ike’s Place,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that “Intrusive remedial work” was performed on the I.V. store following the inspection, ceasing store operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, biohazard signs were scattered throughout the store, bathrooms were closed, the kitchen was sealed off and the I.V. location was unable to make and serve sandwiches, according to the court document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ike’s place was unable to continue to do business at the level it previously did and was accordingly unable to pay rent,” the court document states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leaving the I.V. store uninformed about the mold, the court document alleges, Icon breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it concealed material facts from Ike’s place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. store claims, in the court document, that it was “harmed” by Icon due to its reliance on false information the leasing agency provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Icon’s suppression of material facts was malicious and egregious such that Icon should be liable for punitive damages,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document adds that the I.V. location is seeking compensation for “punitive damages,” the cost of the suit, attorney’s fees and “general, special, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or economic damages…”</span></p>\n<p><b>New State Street Store:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new shop slated to open next week, Shehadeh circumvented the short hiring window by offering all current employees at the I.V location a chance to work at the new store. Furthermore, the store will be managed by one of Ike’s first-ever managers, who will bring roughly 10 years of experience to the new sandwich parlor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Street location is equipped with a parking lot, which allows for a full-size catering menu, decreased wait times for delivery and parking for both employees and customers, according to Shehadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Shehadeh also plans to keep the lights on late into the night, flirting with new store hours such as “10 to 10” on weekdays and “10 to midnight” on weekends. However, the hours will be adjusted according to demand, as Shehadeh finds that there’s no use in staying open if nobody wants to purchase food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further compensate for the move, Shehadeh is excited to offer a “super student discount,” where both Santa Barbara City College and UC Santa Barbara students can tack on chips and a drink to their meal for “a buck fifty.”</span></p>\n<p>The court filings in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself with some free time and extra cash this Saturday, April 27, stop by the Isla Vista Market at Little Acorn Park at 6747 El Embarcadero from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The casual open-air market will host local vendors selling everything from vintage clothing, handmade jewelry and ceramics to biodegradable glitter, stickers and art. There will even be services such as eyebrow threading. Over 30 vendors will be putting their goods on display, with some taking Venmo for payment, too. Isla Vista Trading Post will also have their shop set up and will be allowing patrons to pick out three pieces of clothing for free.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1233084290181051/\"><b>Soundcheck </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some say that the best bands are formed solely by chance. For bands playing at the 2019 Band Lottery Showcase, that’s exactly what happened. About a month ago, Biko Garage Funzone hosted an event where musicians looking to form a group could meet up and be randomly sorted into new bands. Now, some of those bands are returning to Biko Garage at 6612 Sueno Road on Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. to put their new grooves to the test. At least two of the bands are scheduled to play, and Isla Vistans can drop in throughout the night to support some of the newest local music in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/279842549625140/\"><b>Down with Capitalism </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who ever said communism is dead? Definitely not a couple of bands slated to play at Communist Mothers Music Collective this Saturday, April 17 at 8 p.m. Local bands Careless Cub and Aqua Stalin will be providing the tunes for a night of condemning capitalism among comrades. If you’ve got a bone to pick with the system, this is the party for you. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/319398622107660/\"><b>Yoga for the Soul </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mantra Lounge Kirtan Santa Barbara and Yoga Isla Vista host an evening of Kirtan Yoga for community members to gather, shed the stresses of the day and unwind with meditative music. Kirtan is a type of religious performance art, using storytelling and narrating to take participants through meditation, but participants of all beliefs are encouraged to participate. The yoga sesh charges a $5 fee and comes with a complimentary vegan treat. The class will be held at Yoga Isla Vista at 900 Embarcadero Del Mar, Suite D, upstairs from the parking behind Silvergreens. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.earlwarren.com/sbfair\"><b>Fun at the Fairgrounds </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As summer inches closer, lots of people are looking to break away from hitting the books and start enjoying all the fun that summer has to offer. For those looking to get started early, the Santa Barbara Fair &amp; Expo is coming to town this week. It’s open from 4 to 10 p.m. on Thursday, April 25; from 4 to 12 p.m. on Friday, April 26; from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Saturday, April 27; and from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, April 28. The fair, which is dinosaur-themed this year, will have vendors, entertainers, rides and all the other sentimental fair festivities. Tickets are $5 to $8 for general admission and $30 for carnival wristbands. The fair will take place at the Earl Warren Showgrounds at 400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/","id":4197,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4196,4195,4194],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

CSD) has an estimated revenue of $1,069,000, according to numbers released by the district at the April 16 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of April 16, approximately $854,200 are either being used or are being budgeted for a project; the I.V. CSD will end the year with approximately $600,000 in funds, according to numbers introduced at the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, passed in June of last year, placed an 8% user utility tax on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. The tax itself is estimated to net about $700,000 by the end of the fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/i-v-csd-tax-nets-half-a-million-less-than-estimated/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about $200,000 to the district in order to fund projects such as the Community Service Officer (CSO) Safety Stations and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Interpersonal Violence Investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district was open to suggestions about projects it can fund that fall under various categories (public safety, community facilities, housing mediation, public works improvements, parking and community planning) during the Tuesday night forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current programs organized by the I.V. CSD include graffiti abatement, an AmeriCorps partnership and a resource center for survivors of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director and former president Ethan Bertrand gave the floor to those attending after he explained the budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), proposed funding be directed toward peer advocates for Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA). Peer advocates help survivors of sexual assault navigate their options and are required to undergo 60 hours of training beforehand, according to Reynolds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education Center (C.A.R.E.) funds the training for UCSB students but not for volunteers outside of UCSB. SASA recommends funding be directed toward establishing training as a paid position, so as to compensate volunteers for their time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member also proposed the money be used to create a community counseling center for drug addiction, homelessness and suicide intervention, along with a mental health assessment survey of Isla Vista, in which a survey would be sent out to gauge the mental health of I.V. residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also multiple complaints by people concerning the difficulty of negotiating with landlords, leading to discussion about a greater need for tenant resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public safety was a large concern among many in attendance. The need for better lighting, particularly in the farther reaches of I.V., was voiced by several attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis believes a greater community voice is needed for change to happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say, you know, there’s a member of our board that’s really interested in lighting and leading the charge to get better lighting out here and we’ve done the survey and stuff. But the one thing the community can do is be louder that the lighting is insufficient here,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve met with officials that say, ‘Ah, it’s been like that. We can’t do that.’ No. This is what the community wants, and I think we need to make that message clear.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency preparedness was another problem that was raised. Attention was then brought to the Thomas Fire and the lack of communication surrounding it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggestions were made to keep Deltopia local and quiet, so as to not attract outsiders. One solution was raised to have a community festival, but attracting more out-of-towners was still a concern. Planning Deltopia into being a more controlled event is a primary goal for I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unable to attend the public forum budget meeting, project proposals can also be </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTTQt6hc1sAxwWpX94fvHhte7EaAPTT1euio6enUPZqCfCeg/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitted online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary version of the budget will be released at the <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/9590f8912/4_23_2019+Regular+Meeting+Agenda-2.pdf\">next I.V.
