By the end of the evening, the surfaces of the paper lanterns were covered with pictures, songs and simple words such as “I.V. Strong.”</p>\n<p>The memorial events were smaller this year than last, allowing students to address the anniversary and heal in personal ways.</p>\n<p>“I think people just want a space — a space to heal and space to just do whatever they want that is going to benefit them the best — rather than having an organized official event,” Madeline Berger, third-year art and theater double major and student leader for the “Blunite” memorial, said.</p>\n<p>She said the canvases celebrated the life of each student and allowed visitors to acknowledge loss, even if they did not personally know the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think having dedicated spaces like the canvases really do make it a little more connected to each individual that we lost, but … there is no reason you have to connect yourself to exactly one victim,” Berger said. “There [were] tons of people that got hurt, got injured, got shot but recovered … but it was still a part of our community and it still happened to them.”</p>\n<p>Berger described the media attention from last year’s memorial as “overwhelming” and said this year’s gathering was just as special. She believes future anniversaries will be more “private and personal” as the community learns to heal over the passing years.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of the feelings that I’ve been getting from people are just, ‘I need to be able to express it however I am going to express it,’” Berger said. “There doesn’t need to be something big or grand … it can be something as simple as making tea light bags.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They say students will be able to celebrate the students’ lives rather than solely grieving their deaths.</p>\n<p>“This year we just wanted to really again create the same feeling again of unity but also make sure it has a positive spin to it,” said fourth-year communication and art double major Raphaella Faria. “That’s how we decided to create a live carnival and integrate everyone, students, community members.”</p>\n<p>Faria, who helped start Blunite in 2015 with a fellow student and art professor Kim Yasuda, hopes that students can enjoy the prizes, photo booth and crafts while understanding the deeper meaning of the lights.</p>\n<p>“People can expect to have lots of fun, to see lots of lights,” Faria said. “We really wanted to focus on using the LED lights as our symbol.”</p>\n<p>Several I.V. businesses have joined the cause as well, with Otaco, Hana Kitchen and Sorriso Italiano, among others, displaying blue lights. IV Drip created a Blunite cookie and Woodstock’s Pizza will be selling blue beer.</p>\n<p>Faria, who was at UCSB at the time of the shooting, said students must remember that families in I.V. remain even while thousands of students leave each year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70971\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70971\" data-attachment-id=\"70971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-14/blue-lights-in-peoples-park-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy/blunite-prep-jenny-luo-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Blunite Prep\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70971\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=368%2C245\" alt=\"People's Park will be glowing Saturday night as attendees can expect carnival games, prizes and lives DJs.

We want to make sure that this is something that would be able to be commemorated and celebrated after all of the classes leave.”</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, a transfer student, said seeing the community come together after the tragedy was a big reason why he chose to transfer to UCSB. Collins hopes Blunite can help bring students together who may not normally interact.</p>\n<p>“It’s more than just the tragedy,” Collins said. “It’s more about uniting, and that’s what Blunite is about: the uniting, more than anything, of people who never come in contact with each other.”</p>\n<p>Collins, who was breathing heavily Friday after carrying giant cinder block stands from UCSB’s Theatre Department to People’s Park, said it would be hard for students to miss the park on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>“If you’re in IV, you’re going to know that there’s something going on,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Housing Tenants’ Association argued in a statement Tuesday that the rent increase scheduled to begin this summer is unfair, due to what it says are subpar living conditions.</p>\n<p>On Monday, UCSB Housing and Residential Services (H&amp;RS) proposed a 12.2 percent rent increase for the West Campus Family Student Housing and a three percent rent increase at Storke Family Student Housing beginning July 1.</p>\n<p>In response to the proposed increases, the Tenants’ Association called the rent hikes “unfair,” due to what it says are poor living conditions at the residences and the extended construction of university-owned housing. The Tenants’ Association is calling upon the university, Residential Services and the Office of the President (UCOP) to end all future rent increases.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, Director of Business and Financial Planning at H&amp;RS, said family student housing rent increases three percent each year, according to the department’s long-term rent plan. These increases correspond to operating costs such as labor costs and utilities, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker said the Tenants’ Association initially requested, in March 2014, that the university freeze rent for West Campus during the two-year construction of the Sierra Madre apartments. He said the university and the Tenants’ Association both agreed to this proposal, with a stipulation that the rates raise to fit the long-term plan at the end of the two-year period.</p>\n<p>Now that construction for Sierra Madre apartments is complete, the proposed 9.2 percent rent increase for West Campus Family Student Housing makes up for the two years of frozen rent, according to H&amp;RS officials. Combined with the annual three percent increase, this will amount to a 12.2 percent increase.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parfrey, Tenants’ Association Board president and a West Campus resident, said the Tenants’ Association’s goal is to encourage the housing department to improve the living quality at family student housing, not to “shame” the university.</p>\n<p>“There’s all this investment going on around us and no significant money being put into our living conditions, other than getting things up to code, which in my opinion is not an improvement to the amenities,” said Parfrey, third-year environmental studies and biological anthropology double major.</p>\n<p>“The three percent is standard … it happens not just in family housing; it happens in all of our residential units,” said Jessica Fougere, placement service manager of housing and residential services. “So there’s always a percentage increase; because everything goes up in cost each year, the cost of anybody living anywhere goes up.”</p>\n<p>Residents of university-owned housing have voiced concern over the rent increase and explained that issues such as unsanitary living conditions, outdated plumbing and inadequate kitchenware should invalidate higher costs for student families.</p>\n<p>“It infuriates me to think us students who come here with our families . . . have to live in these conditions, whether we like it or not, because it’s all that’s available to us in the affordable housing shortage of [Isla Vista] and larger Santa Barbara area,” said Jessica Foster, a fifth-year environmental studies major and West Campus resident, in an email.</p>\n<p>“West Campus is a half-dilapidated, subpar housing complex for student families,” said Brian Griffith, a graduate student who lives on West Campus. “We have lead-based paint in our homes. We have dirty water . . . We have, and have had, construction all around us for several years … If anything, these deteriorating living conditions deserve a rent decrease. So the least housing can do is freeze our rental rates as they are.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A featured image initially showed West Campus Faculty Housing, it now shows West Campus Family

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Fernanda Cerrato, a second-year political science major, moved into her apartment on Cordoba Road in September 2015, she could not help but notice the seemingly incorrect</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spanish in many of the surrounding street names—“Del Playa” appeared to her an incorrect version of “de la playa,” which means “to the beach” in Spanish.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato was born in Sonora, Mexico, and moved to a Mexican-American neighborhood of Oxnard, Calif. at 14. She now notices when people pronounce “El Colegio” with a hard “g” instead of the “h” sound used by native Spanish-speakers.</span></p>\n<p>“Everyone knew how to pronounce things in Spanish” in Oxnard, Cerrato said. “People here don’t try whatsoever to pronounce the names correctly.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad Spanish seems to be abundant in Isla Vista’s street names, and historians say that these mistranslated titles are the work of I.V.’s earliest developers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landowners Pauline and John Ilharreguy built and named the four major streets that run parallel to the bluffs — Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road, Trigo Road and Pasado Road — in 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spanish street names and “Isla Vista” were intended to keep with the Spanish colonial theme then in use by much of Santa Barbara as it rebuilt itself following the 1925 earthquake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. historians agree that the Ilharreguys were probably not good at Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista” is Spanish for Island View, but is not grammatically correct, and “Sabado Tarde” was supposed to mean “Saturday afternoon,” but Spanish-speakers typically say “Sabado por la tarde.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historians also find “Pasado” to be an odd choice. Had the Ilharreguys chosen “Pasada,” the name would have meant “passage,” but the “o” at the end changed the meaning to “overripe” or “spoiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether Santa Barbara County officials noticed the Spanish mistranslations, the Board of Supervisors approved and accepted the names of Isla Vista’s streets in November 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months later, attorneys Alfred W. Robertson and James R. Thompson built three long roads adjacent to the bluffs, two of which joined in a loop on the east side of Isla Vista. They named these streets “Embarcadero Del Mar” and “Embarcadero Del Norte,” meaning “Ocean Wharf” and “North Wharf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorneys set aside the inside of the loop for an athletic park, and they extended the four parallel roads built by the Ilharreguys. Most of the streets on the east end of I.V. kept their original names, except Pasado Road, which was renamed “Sevilla” and later became Seville Road.</span></p>\n<p>Robertson and Thompson also named the streets that crossed Embarcadero Del Mar and Embarcadero Del Norte: Cervantes Road, El Greco Road, Picasso Road, Segovia Road, Cordoba Road, Madrid Road and Seville Road. The developers named these streets after prominent Spanish artists and cities, but the streets only existed on paper at the time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harriet and Brenda Moody, the daughters of building contractor Elmer Moody, developed a tract of land from the Ilharreguy property to Coal Oil Point, submitting a map to the county in April 1926.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite much of the planning that took place in the 1920s between these various landowners, much of Isla Vista looked as though it had never been developed by the early 1940s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historian Jennifer Hildreth Strand noted in her 1987</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">master’s thesis at UC Santa Barbara that Isla Vista was covered with bean fields, a place where “goats wandered” and “roosters crowed.”</span></p>\n<p>The streets that are now Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared unnamed in a 1944 map of Isla Vista, when a U.S. Marine Corps base was located in place of UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the establishment of the university, developers began consulting many of the plans laid out by the Ilharreguys, Robertson and Thompson and the Moody sisters in the 1920s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county formed an Assessment District in 1960 to pave and construct much of these roads. By 1968, a map of Isla Vista indicated the newly added Camino Majorca, Fortuna Road, Fortuna Lane and Estero Road. Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared as named streets on this map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sueno Road seems to have referred to “dream” in Spanish, but the current spelling omits the “ñ” used in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato said it does not surprise her at all that historic developers named many of Isla Vista’s streets with little knowledge of the Spanish language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a white community, so this is expected,” Cerrato said.</span></p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">A

believe noise, drugs and alcohol are problems in Isla Vista. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Middle school and high school students convened Tuesday in Isla Vista, asking community leaders to acknowledge the need for a safe, peaceful community conducive to their busy schedules.</p>\n<p>About 35 teenage students from schools throughout Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of 200 I.V. residents indicating that Isla Vistans are overwhelmingly concerned about alcohol, drugs and noise in the community.</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the students split into groups and canvassed I.V., asking 200 residents — almost half of which were college students — what they found problematic in the area.</p>\n<p>Of the 200 residents surveyed, 88.5 percent said alcohol is a problem in I.V., 84 percent said drugs are a problem and 85 percent said noise is an issue on the weekends.</p>\n<p>“Some of my nights when I’m in Isla Vista doing my homework, it can be really noisy,” said one 15-year-old who presented some of the findings Tuesday. “I am a student, too.”</p>\n<p>Named “I’m a Student, Too!,” the event sought to remind UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that there are younger students in I.V. who attend middle schools and high schools in the county.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 200 residents surveyed, the students also asked 100 locals for their favorite thing about I.V., recording responses including the beach, the warm weather, Freebirds and the Children’s Park. Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V.

It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pescadero Lofts, built in 2014 at 761 Camino Pescadero for nearly $10 million, brought 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the street. Managers are planning to house several more this year. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A new count and survey shows a slight increase in the number of homeless in Isla Vista from last year but a decrease of nearly 50 percent since 2013.</p>\n<p>The survey by the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness (C3H) was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Pescadero Lofts, a nearly $10 million complex that opened in 2014 to bring 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the streets.</p>\n<p>Volunteers, many of whom were UC Santa Barbara students, counted 19 homeless people in I.V. this April using a smartphone app to determine their “vulnerability score” based on questions about income, health, substance abuse and duration of homelessness.</p>\n<p>This year’s count is up slightly from 13 in January 2015 — a month after the lofts opened — but is a significant decrease from 34 in 2013.</p>\n<p>One reason the number of homeless may have increased from last year is that all of the previous year’s surveys (2011, 2013, 2015) were conducted in January when it is colder, while this year’s survey took place in April.</p>\n<p>The most recent survey, however, was conducted over a smaller area than in past years, spanning from UCSB to the Devereux Lagoon and from El Colegio Road to the beach, omitting the Ellwood area in Goleta for the first time.</p>\n<p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, volunteers were instructed to approach people they believed were homeless, report the person’s current location and ask where they had slept the previous night. People who said they slept outside of I.V. were not counted in the survey.</p>\n<p>“For us to really be able to help people, we need to know who they are, where they are and what they need,” said Luke Barrett, the regional coordinator for C3H in South Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>C3H will select up to 10 of I.V.’s most vulnerable homeless and move them into permanent housing, either in the Pescadero Lofts or at other locations such as Friendship Manor or veteran housing.</p>\n<p>Chuck Flacks, executive editor of C3H, said I.V. poses unique obstacles to organizations helping the homeless because some people come to I.V. with little more than the clothes on their back.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has historically been a community of openness — almost an experimental community,” Flacks said. “Since the ‘60s and before, I.V. was a kind of utopian place. There are plenty of people who kind of come to Isla Vista to just be in this utopian environment.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Ferraez, on-site resident manager for the Pescadero Lofts, said that I.V. has a “unique chronic homeless population,” noting that I.V. is 15 miles from the nearest shelter despite the fact that I.V.’s homeless are more likely to have mental health issues than those in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There are people living [in the lofts] or on the waiting list who truly don’t want to live downtown and don’t feel supported downtown,” Ferraez said. “They are isolated from all supportive services besides the I.V. Clinic.”</p>\n<p>Ferraez said there is an “overrepresentation of chronic alcoholism” in I.V.’s homeless population, something she said may be due to the “high accessibility of alcohol in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The smartphone survey allows C3H to help I.V.’s unique homeless population by quantifying the vulnerability of each homeless person in I.V. Barrett said this “evidence-based” approach gives the homeless “leverage against the system and the bureaucratic nightmare of low-income housing.”</p>\n<p>Many of the initial 35 people placed in the lofts in 2014 were chronic drug users, Barrett said, and are now doing “tremendously better.” He attributes this to the housing itself, but also the access to food, social care, health care and mental health services that the lofts provide.</p>\n<p>Barrett said the fact that the homeless population is still far below its 2013 level is evidence against the idea that if you build services like the Pescadero Lofts, homeless people will come to the area. However, Barrett said there is still much to be done to make sure all homeless people in I.V. have access to the services they need.</p>\n<p>“We know there are some people out there for sure and we have got to figure out how to help them,” Barrett said. “We need to know their names, to know what they look like, to know their needs.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kaitlyn Tang contributed

building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firefighters unplugged the electric oven and brought it outside the building as a fan blew smoke out of the way.</span></p>\n<p>A next door neighbor called 911 after smelling smoke, a firefighter on the scene said. Two fire engines, a firetruck, a rescue ambulance and a battalion chief initially responded to the fire.</p>\n<p>The firefighter on the scene said the area was safe and that the fire had been contained to the oven.</p>\n<p>Residents evacuated some rooms adjacent to the apartment, but by 7:30 p.m. several people were re-entering their homes.

id=\"caption-attachment-69841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista, pictured here during Deltopia 2014, is in the middle of a historic push toward self-governance.</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista, currently an unincorporated area, is leaping toward self-governance in a historic push that could give residents a say in how the area is run.</p>\n<p>The effort toward self-governance is confusing, however, and this confusion is compounded by an alphabet soup of acronyms: CSD, UUT and MAC, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud and Cameron Schunk co-authored the Isla Vista Plan of Service, which is a tentative plan for how the area would be run if the measures are passed by Isla Vista voters in November.</p>\n<p>Residents have been pushing for self-governance for nearly 50 years, as Abboud outlined in a <em>Nexus </em>op-ed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/history-in-the-making-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in April</a>. To get students and I.V. residents up to speed, the<em> Nexus</em> spoke with Abboud and Schunk and asked them some of the most pressing questions about I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>You can click on a question below or scroll through the

<a href=\"#9\">Is the I.V.

What is a community service district and how is it different than a city?</strong></h2>\n<p>Arguably the most important difference between a community service district (CSD) and a city is that cities can make laws while CSDs cannot.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan, said the size of I.V. and the fact that many residents spend their money outside of the area are also factors.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to afford a city with the tax base I.V. has,” Abboud said. “Our sales tax revenues in I.V. are very low. We really only have Pardall [businesses], and a lot of people spend their money in downtown Santa Barbara and Goleta. It’s hard to have a city because we don’t have a tax base for it.”</p>\n<p>Both cities and CSDs are required to do certain things, but cities have more responsibilities. For example, a city is required by law to provide police and jail services.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, co-author of the I.V. Plan and a field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams, said that Goleta spends half of its annual budget on policing. While Goleta residents are generally more comfortable with law enforcement, Schunk said, I.V. residents may be less willing to spend a substantial amount of money on policing.</p>\n<p>“We could never, ever, ever provide police services at all, and even though we have that authority, we’re not required to do it,” Schunk said. “The city has a lot of things that it not only has the authority to do, but the requirement to do.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"2\">2. What are I.V. residents voting on in November?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Nov. 8, Isla Vistans will vote on three measures. The first two measures require a simple majority, while the third measure requires a two-thirds majority.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an Isla Vista CSD.</li>\n<li>A vote selecting five of the directors who will govern the district (see <a href=\"#3\">question 3</a>).</li>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an 8 percent utility users tax (see <a href=\"#4\">question 4</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If passed, all three measures would go into effect on March 1, 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"3\">3. Who will be in charge of the CSD?</strong></h2>\n<p>Seven directors will govern the CSD. When I.V. residents vote in November on whether or not to establish the CSD, they will also elect five members to sit on a new Board of Directors. In addition, one director will be appointed by the county and one director will be appointed by UCSB.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69844\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69844\" data-attachment-id=\"69844\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/jonathan-abboud_by-spencer-brandt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jonathan Abboud_by Spencer Brandt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69844\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=235%2C156\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"235\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“The directors are responsible for everything the CSD does,” Abboud said. “They are responsible for making sure it’s fiscally responsible. They’re the ones who vote on policy and make sure the policy is implemented.”</p>\n<p>These directors would also hire a general manager to oversee the day-to-day activities that keep the district running.</p>\n<p>Four of the five elected directors and both appointed directors would have four-year terms. The other elected director would have a two-year term. There are no term limits for the directors, which Schunk said could work to the Board’s advantage.</p>\n<p>“We are very interested in having long-term representation on that board,” Schunk said. “That is helpful for a lot of districts because if there is a question of how they did something 40 years ago, there’s a guy who can answer that.”</p>\n<p>Candidates for the Board will have to register to run by Aug. 8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"4\">4. What powers will the CSD have?</strong></h2>\n<p>The I.V. Plan outlines eight powers the CSD is prioritizing:</p>\n<p><strong>• Municipal Advisory Council (MAC):</strong> The MAC would be purely advisory, giving input to the Board of Directors based on feedback from I.V. residents. It is possible that the MAC would include directors from the Board.</p>\n<p><strong>• Area Planning Commission (APC):</strong> The APC would essentially be a zoning board that would “oversee all new development proposals that are submitted within the Isla Vista area,” according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Graffiti abatement:</strong> The I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District is currently in charge of washing away graffiti, but the I.V. Plan says finding funding for this program is a “constant struggle.” The Plan proposes a $10,000 annual budget to keep graffiti abatement up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>• Parking district</strong>: The I.V. Plan proposes funding comprehensive parking studies that will allow the Board of Directors, with the survey data, to establish a parking district specific to I.V.’s needs.</p>\n<p><strong>• Landlord-tenant mediation services:</strong> UCSB students currently have access to tenant mediation services through the UCSB Community Housing Office, but the I.V. Plan proposes a contract between the CSD and the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program specifically aimed toward non-UCSB students in I.V., half of which are Hispanic families, according to the Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Community policing:</strong> The I.V. Plan proposes a “cadet program” run through I.V. Foot Patrol, employing five cadets that would work part-time, especially during weekend nights when UCSB is in session.</p>\n<p><strong>• Gutter, street tree and sidewalk infrastructure improvement: </strong>A proposed $5,000 would go toward “enhancements to public space” such as trees next to streets, art on sidewalks and benches, according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Maintenance and management of community facilities: </strong>The I.V. Plan proposes hiring a half-time grant writer whose job would be ascertaining funding for the I.V. Community Center at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"5\">5. How will the CSD pay for these services?</strong></h2>\n<p>The simple answer is federal grants, UCSB funding and a tax on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>When Isla Vistans vote in November, they will vote on whether to enact a utility users tax (UUT), which will tax I.V. residents’ electricity, water, gas and trash services at a rate of 8 percent. If passed, the tax would go into effect on March 1, 2017, when the CSD is officially established.</p>\n<p>Schunk said that, as of now, almost everybody’s services would be taxed equally at 8 percent, although there would be exemptions for low-income residents and families and potentially a difference between residential and commercial properties.</p>\n<p>“My hope is that the Board of Directors do a series of public engagement workshops,” Schunk said, “where they meet with stakeholders from the business community, students, community members and say, ‘Here is your expected burden; is that acceptable? Yes or no.’”</p>\n<p>UCSB has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years, and backers of the CSD also hope to get additional money by applying for federal grants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"6\">6. What is AB 3?</strong></h2>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3, authored by Assemblymember Das Williams and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown on Oct. 7, 2015, gives I.V. the power to do things that no other CSD is allowed to do if it is passed by voters. These services include running a parking district, establishing a tenant mediation program and creating the Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“No other CSD in the entire state of California has ever been able to provide a tenant mediation program. No CSD has ever been able to provide code enforcement,” Schunk said. “When we talk about how unique AB 3 and the CSD is, it goes deeper …  There are so many things here that no other district has.”</p>\n<p>Abboud and Schunk emphasized that, because the I.V. CSD would be the first of its kind to implement several programs, it is vital that passionate people serve on the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>“There is no precedent for how a CSD runs a tenant mediation program, which is why it’s really important [that the Board includes] people who are critical thinkers who are really looking at the big picture,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"7\">7. Why can’t the county provide these services with the county tax?</strong></h2>\n<p>Backers of the proposed CSD say it provides an advantage over county services because the services would be developed specifically for I.V., and the UUT would generate funds that are dedicated to services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The way the county operates, the service they provide you in Isla Vista has to be the exact same service as in the unincorporated Los Olivos area,” Schunk said, adding that the CSD would create more “localized” services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69846\" style=\"width: 240px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69846\" data-attachment-id=\"69846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/lafco-spencerbrandt-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO/Cameron Schunk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69846\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=230%2C154\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"230\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cameron Schunk, co-author of the I.V. Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“People in the City of Santa Barbara chose to form a city and tax themselves for services,” Schunk said. “A similar thing is happening here in Isla Vista. You’re seeing residents saying we want these services this way and we’ll pay for them.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that, currently, in order for I.V. to get funding for various projects, it needs the support of supervisors who have no attachment to the area.</p>\n<p>“To get funding from the county for things, you need four supervisors to vote in your favor,” Abboud said. “[Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr can be the best supervisor anyone’s been, but if the other supervisors, or even two supervisors, don’t want the funding to go to I.V. for a small service, it won’t happen.”</p>\n<p>“The best thing I.V. voters can do is vote for our supervisor,” Abboud said. “We can’t influence what the other districts are doing.”</p>\n<p>The CSD would change that and give Isla Vistans representatives who would serve the area directly, according to Abboud and Schunk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"8\">8. How will the CSD change the average Isla Vistan’s day-to-day life?</strong></h2>\n<p>Schunk and Abboud said that, for the first time, I.V. residents would have people close by who represent their interests and are focused solely on I.V.’s needs.</p>\n<p>“You would have someone to talk to and listen to you whose full-time responsibility is I.V.,” Abboud said. “For a supervisor, I.V. is just a part of what they do.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he often wishes he could direct people to the kind of services that would be provided if the CSD is approved.</p>\n<p>“I hear people complain about stuff, but they have no idea who to talk to about it or how to get it fixed or who is even responsible for that problem in the first place,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"9\">9. Is the I.V. Plan of Service final?</strong></h2>\n<p>Abboud said the Plan is “just a concept” and that residents should request the services they want to see in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If you implemented the Plan word for word, it would work, but it doesn’t have to be a reality,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Schunk added that the plan is subject to change and is not “set in stone.”</p>\n<p>“I want people to feel empowered to go and advocate for the services that they feel most strongly about when the CSD is formed,” Schunk said. “None of those budget items are set in stone.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"10\">10.

Safe, a committee created in March 2014 by Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley, who also serves as committee chair, attributes the decrease in crime to informal police-student interactions,

of Supervisors meeting Tuesday morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Although you’re going to be hearing in detail about the report . . . the proof is in the pudding,” Farr said,

College (SBCC) students who are arrested during these party weekends are required to meet with an SBCC dean.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thousands of students attended Fitz and the

are supported in the community,” said Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a UCSB alumnus who focuses on issues affecting I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pragin noted that although arrests and citations declined this year, the numbers increased as a percentage of those who attended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Adams, chair of the board and fourth district supervisor, said the people who attended Deltopia 2016 must have been the ones who were causing problems in past years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though you had less people attending, those are the people that were the problem in the first place,” Adams said, adding that those people will not learn to “conduct themselves in an adult fashion” until they “get arrested a few more times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe they’ll learn their lesson at some point, I know I did,” Adams said. “I just think that this number will go down if we keep chipping away at that culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Freeman, an Isla Vista resident running for third district supervisor, was very critical of the report, and said I.V. Safe acts as if Isla Vista is “a dangerous infestation” and “a problem to be solved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman unfurled large posters of what he said were previous advertising campaigns by I.V. Safe. He said the committee “truly crossed a line” when it ran a picture of inside a medical tent with the caption, “Throwback Thursday to people having a blast at Deltopia last year.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The message of I.V. Safe is one of a totalitarian police state trying to scare people into compliance,” Freeman said, adding that the group’s “rebranding” commercial “comes off as a campaign advertisement for a handful of politicians.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69454\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69454\" data-attachment-id=\"69454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/isla-vista-crime-down-25-over-two-years-da-reports/board-of-supervisors-meeting-4-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Board of Supervisors Meeting 4-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69454\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf disagreed, saying the advertisement campaign might help others realize that there are consequences to drinking heavily in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pictures of the kids in the tent who were getting medical treatment, it was horrible to me,” Wolf said. “It just kind of struck home to me that this could happen.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board members were very supportive of the campaign, thanking the report’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributors extensively, and were hopeful for what they see as an improved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal said I.V.

in recent years, resulting in a less devastating aftermath of pollution in the small, oceanside area. This year, an approximate 250 volunteers assembled at 11 a.m. to clean up I.V. — a considerably smaller group than the 349 volunteers in 2015 and 367 in 2014, but just as successful as in previous years.</p>\n<p>Most volunteers tend to be I.V. residents who want to keep their neighborhood clean, according to Adam Portè, Adopt-A-Block supervisor. “Unfortunately, a lot of the times the people that were partying here on Saturday night are gone by Sunday morning,” said Portè, who was pleased to see the work completed in two hours after posting pictures online of the 66 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69346\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69346\" data-attachment-id=\"69346\"
