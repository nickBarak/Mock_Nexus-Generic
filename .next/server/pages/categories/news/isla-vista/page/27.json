UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa led the discussion, and four other officers attended to answer students’ questions in smaller groups. Deputies from Isla Vista Foot Patrol were initially expected to attend, but did not make an appearance. Questions about the I.V. noise ordinance, parking restrictions and roadblocks and the high number of cops brought in for Deltopia dominated the event.</p>\n<p>Signa opened the event by detailing the parking restrictions on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde, and encouraged students to buy on-campus parking permits and said the event’s purpose was to foster open dialogue.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of tonight is really just an opportunity for me to talk to you about Deltopia and what we are doing there,” Signa said. “It’s also — more importantly — for me to be available to you to answer any questioning.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD officer Alexis Dougherty said Pizza with Police is good way to educate students on Deltopia and other law enforcement matters.</p>\n<p>“If they have any questions about what’s going to go on this weekend, they can feel free to come up to us and ask openly,” Dougherty said.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Oliveira, a first-year global studies major, said she came to the event to better understand what Deltopia will be like.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year here, so I don’t really know what to expect at Deltopia,” Oliveira said. “I’m hoping this will give me more information on what is going to happen and on how I can make it safe.”</p>\n<p>Shiva Mozaffarian, a fourth-year biology major who had an involved discussion with Signa during the event, said she wrote a list of questions beforehand to ensure she could express her concerns.</p>\n<p>“I wrote them up because I wanted to make sure that I could rationally say all my frustrations about the police department,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she attended the event primarily to understand the perspective of police officers on Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that these cops are the police officers that I have problems with, so I just wanted to see if they shared that same issues that we have as the community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>According to Mozaffarian, some students resist the cops only because they want to party freely, but others, like those who attend events like Pizza with Police, want to offer useful criticism.</p>\n<p>“Some people have problems with the cops because they stop them from partying and drinking, but I think a lot of people are genuinely looking out for the well-being of our community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had questions about the special noise ordinance in I.V. for Deltopia weekend. The ordinance states I.V. residents playing music that can be heard from the street can be cited and given a $500 fine. Signa said the ordinance is meant to limit the size of gathering in I.V. residences.</p>\n<p>“As long as the music can’t be heard from outside, it’s no issue, and we’re not looking for that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Jake Gorham, a third-year political science major, and Duncan Calvert, a third-year political science and history double major, organized the event in their roles as public safety coordinators for the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). They started a volunteer force called UCIV Safety Coalition that will consist of 30 volunteers patrolling I.V. during Deltopia handing our water and warning students who may be at risk of citation or arrest.</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes that, if the UCIV program is successful, he and Calvert can turn it into a more permanent establishment to contribute to community policing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are really trying to advocate for community policing in Isla Vista, and we are hoping the volunteer program brings that out,” Gorham said. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we are hoping for gradual change.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvert, the volunteer force will mainly focus on preventing noise-related citations and said they will help relay information about parking restrictions, but obeying the law is ultimately the individual student’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>“The volunteer force is hopefully going to mitigate all of the noise ordinance violations,” Calvert said. “We really don’t want students having misdemeanors on their records and having that bad experience.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes that the volunteer force will show UCPD and the IVFP that there are students actively seeking solutions for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The majority of police officers are dealing with our population at its worst,” Calvert said. “We are trying to create a good dialogue between the student body and officers who care and are committed.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said he supports Gorham and Clavert’s endeavor.</p>\n<p>“It’s better that students talk to students than that the cops talk to them,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes arrests will be minimal, but warned that there will be no drunk tank in I.V. and all students will be processed and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>“If arrests do happen, we will be very strict as far as if you are drinking and publicly intoxicated,” Signa said. “With all the cops out there, there will be zero tolerance.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian however said she thinks the cops focus too much on arresting students for public drunkenness.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is that — after everything we’ve undergone — I think it’s been proven that the problems of I.V. are not due to the parties or the drunk students walking around minding their own business,” Mozaffarian said. “The problem is bigger than that.”</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes UCIV will help warn students that they are at risk for arrest for public drunkenness before they come in contact with the police.</p>\n<p>“The police have said it’s technically a no-tolerance policy during Detlopia,” Gorham said. “Our goal is to be able to give out warnings and give people a heads up.”</p>\n<p>A central concern among students at the event was the increase of police presence planned for Deltopia, but Signa said this increase is proven to correlate with lower crime rates.</p>\n<p>“The whole idea is we want to saturate the place and just be visible,” Signa said. “They are looking for people who might be causing problems that might be dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Signa said he believes the solution to I.V.’s fundamental problems do not lie in increased police presence.</p>\n<p>“As much as the police department and the sheriff’s department put in effort as far as having cops here, bringing in a horse team, and all this extra equipment, that’s only a band aid that doesn’t fix the problem,” Signa said. “The problem has to be fixed from within the community.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she understands the crime-prevention intention of increased police presence but said she is not convinced of its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really understand why we bring extra law enforcement, but still go after drunk students just sitting on a curb,” Mozaffarian said. “If the cops are here to protect and serve, they shouldn’t be victimizing the students.”</p>\n<p>After the event, Mozaffarian said Signa was clearly being “diplomatic” when he answered her questions and she said she appreciated his effort to work with students.</p>\n<p>“Mark is such an amazing guy,” Mozaffarian said. “He is one of the cops that prove that there are good cops out there with good intentions who are looking out for the best of our community.”</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes the dialogue between students and police can extend beyond Pizza with Police and special circumstances like Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“We need to represent you,” Signa said. “You need to be able to come to us and ask your questions — not just at Pizza with the Cops.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A CSD is a form of local self-government, in which a given area can levy taxes to pay for certain municipal services through a locally elected board. The primary questions facing the group included the size and makeup of the governance board, how it would be formed and how members would be elected. Attendees split up into small groups and debated the finer points of these and other aspects of a governing board for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Options for governance board selection included discussions on whether or not the CSD governing board would be composed of at-large members, representatives elected by the entire district to represent the entire district, or district members representing certain geographic portions of the CSD and elected by residents of those portions. Other contentious issues involved the ratio of elected-to-appointed members of the board, with significant disagreements regarding the ratio of appointed or elected board members, as well as the boundaries of the would-be CSD.</p>\n<p>Williams began the meeting with a brief introduction on the goals of AB 3 and the public meetings occurring to flesh out the specifics of the bill language. The bill as it stands, according to Williams in a prior interview, should include language that provides powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission. The bill has until mid-March before it enters legislative committees in Sacramento, at which point it can still be modified.</p>\n<p>Groups primarily disagreed on the makeup of the board by numbers, with boards as large as 11 members and as small as five proposed by several of the working groups. A group led by Associated Students Senators third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez and second-year physics major Liam Stanton proposed a six member governing board with three ex officio non-voting members, possibly representing Santa Barbara City College, the university and the I.V. Property Owners Association, a majority of which would be elected by a margin of at least two members.</p>\n<p>“As far as the composition of the board goes, we felt that having the majority of the board be elected was absolutely essential to democratic ideals,” Stanton said. “There should be two more elected members than appointed members at least.”</p>\n<p>Stanton also said SBCC should be ex-officio but not voting because the college does not generate tax revenue for the would-be CSD. Lopez said the CSD board should be apportioned into voting districts with elected members ideally coming from different stakeholder groups in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If possible we would like the districts to be formed around the idea of one district more likely to represent a long term homeowner, one group more likely to represent a long term homeowner, a renter, perhaps a Latino renter, or both, one group more likely to do a student representative … and other two groups to be divided based on the areas that aren’t already in those groups,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Open People’s Party chair Andre Theus said his group proposed a seven member board of four elected and three appointed representatives and favored an at-large basis for board representation and district boundaries including portions of West Campus and family housing.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think there should be people elected from certain districts, whatever the geographical terms would be,” Theus said. “There’s a lot of talk only including the box or square of Isla Vista; I personally thought we should include … the housing of those students, West Campus and faculty, because a major portion of students in the next 3-5 years will be living and centered near Santa Catalina.”</p>\n<p>One topic of debate at the meeting was the extent to which the university should participate in the CSD. Alumnus Alex Rodriguez, who graduated in December with a degree in political science, said the CSD does not need to include the university at all. Rodriguez said the last time I.V. residents proposed a CSD, the university opted not to participate in the process.</p>\n<p>“My problem is that UCSB has never cared about I.V.,” Rodriguez said. “They just bought up property so they can collect taxes in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Sasha Bates, a first-year history major and OPP candidate for off-campus senator, said although OPP does not take a stance on the CSD as a whole, he does believe the university should be part of the conversation.</p>\n<p>“I thinks it’s completely absurd to say UCSB doesn’t care about Isla Vista,” Bates said. “Isla Vista gets its heart and soul from the student population.”</p>\n<p>Bates said if I.V. does become a CSD, it should include the university as a stakeholder.</p>\n<p>“I think UCSB should have some role,” Bates said. “UCSB is an integral part of the Isla Vista community, be it faculty or students.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said he is personally in favor of involving the university in the CSD. According to him, incorporating the campus would help the CSD financially.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the talks we’ve been having have UCSB being included in our CSD, and that would be a big income,” Lopez said. “In the last few years they have definitely picked up on the amount they are interested in helping the community.”</p>\n<p>But Rodriguez said the university’s tendency to continue “pushing students off campus” has only lead to a housing crisis for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and the property owners got us here in the first place,” Rodriguez said</p>\n<p>Molasses Jones, who lives in the Pescadero Lofts, said she is skeptical about involving the university within the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Adding UCSB to the fold is a bad deal,” Jones said. “They’re going to take over this little area that has opportunities to self-govern and create the environment that it wants to create.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said he favors elections by district divisions, and wants all members to be democratically elected rather than appointed.</p>\n<p>“I’m personally opposed to having any appointed members on the board at all,” Stanton said. “I think one appointee, but if we’re going to have to have one, it should be a student or someone from the administration of UCSB or SBCC.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the district-based voting has the potential to represent different interests in I.V. and that different groups of residents, such as long-term, home-owning, low-income or student residents, tend to live in different parts of I.V.</p>\n<p>“UCSB students live certain places, SBCC students live certain places, and they have different needs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Stanton, however, said he thinks there will be appointees on the CSD board due to pressure from the university and property holders or business owners who do not live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s inevitable we’re going to end up with one or two, because that’s the consensus,” Stanton said. “But I don’t like it.”</p>\n<p>Bates said he hopes to see an increase in student involvement with the CSD process than he has seen so far, based on an observation that very few students were present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have more students involved in the community,” Bates said. “Whenever students turn up I think more can be achieved.”</p>\n<p>Another issue groups discussed at the meeting was how the CSD would represent I.V. property owners. Rodriguez and Stanton both opposed property owner involvement, but Lopez said it is necessary to include in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t include them, they could use their money and resources to oppose our efforts,” Lopez said. “If we don’t include them and the CSD does go through, we could pass all the ordinances we want. But if the property owners don’t consent to something on their property, it could really damper what we can actually do.”</p>\n<p>Jones said she does not want companies who own property in I.V. to have control in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The way Isla Vista has been in the past few years, I don’t think anyone who doesn’t live in I.V. should be involved,” Jones said. “They’re just collecting rent.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, including appointed positions to the CSD from university or property representatives take away from the idea of I.V. “self-governance.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the idea of giving control up to other people,” Jones said. “It’s called self-governance for a reason.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/","id":4754,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4753,4752,4751],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Families Sue For Wrongful Death","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"The families of former UCSB students David Wang, James Hong and George Chen jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Cap...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p>The families of former UCSB students, engineering majors Weihan “David” Wang and Cheng “James” Hong and computer science major George Chen, jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Monday against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) and Capri Apartments over the deaths of their sons during last year’s May 23 Isla Vista mass murder.</p>\n<p>Wang and Hong were roommates of 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) student Elliot Rodger, who murdered the pair as well as their visiting friend, Chen, at their residence at #7 Capri Apartments on Seville Road on May 23 before fatally shooting three other UCSB students and injuring 14 others.</p>\n<p>Representing the families are Los Angeles-based wrongful death law firms Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, seeking to prove the legal liability of Capri Apartments and SBCSD in the deaths of Wang, Hong and Chen. The civil suit contends the defendants neglected signs of Rodger’s threat potential, which could have prevented the tragedy had they been better addressed.</p>\n<p>The families are pursuing compensation from the county for emotional, physical and psychological damages incurred by the loss of their sons in the massacre, as well as attorney’s fees for the costs of lawsuit.</p>\n<p>A joint statement written by Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas stated the plaintiffs are citing SBCSD for negligence before and during an April 30 welfare check on Rodger, and Capri Apartments for carelessness when investigating and assigning roommates.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit alleges that the SBCSD increased the danger to the decedents who were in a place of safety when a welfare check was performed on April 30, 2014,” the press release stated. “The lawsuit also alleges that Capri Apartments failed to perform a proper background check; conduct a reasonable investigation of Rodger before assigning him roommates; properly monitor its roommate pairings; and warn Rodger’s roommates of his unstable and violent propensities.”</p>\n<p>Chen’s mother Kelly Wang, who attended Tuesday’s lawsuit press conference in Los Angeles on behalf of the three victims’ families, said it has been difficult for the victims’ parents to accept that crimes committed by Rodger may have been prevented had the Sheriff’s Department conducted a more thorough search during the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“We were deeply saddened when we learned that in several earlier incidents, the police officers had a chance to investigate the killer, and would have stopped the rampage,” Wang said. “We were truly devastated when we learned that the killer made a narrow escape from the welfare check just less than a month before the massacre.”</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group Owner Todd Becker said Capri Apartments should have been responsible for conducting more thorough research on Rodger in order to realize that he was “not a suitable roommate for anyone,” as proved by numerous conflicts he had with all of his past roommates which required him to constantly move and switch roommates.</p>\n<p>“As student housing, Capri had a duty to investigate Mr. Rodger and determine if he was suitable to be a roommate, of not only our boys but all the other young men that he was roommates with before,” Becker said. “He had seven prior roommates before our kids were his roommates, and he had conflicts with each and every one of them.”</p>\n<p>According to Becker, Capri apartments only investigated the financial capabilities of Rodger to pay rent instead of conducting a thorough background check that would have revealed his inclinations toward anger and violence.</p>\n<p>“With one simple click on the internet … they could have easily found out that this information was available, [that] Rodger was not a suitable roommate,” Becker said. “They only investigated that was Rodger able to pay. Well, his father’s in Hollywood, clearly he’s able to pay. But they didn’t investigate the security issues and his racist and misogynistic tendencies, clearly seen online and in his rantings and ravings and interactions with police, and interactions with all his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Becker said Rodger had several conflicts with past roommates, the first of which occurred August 2011 and continued with a new roommates up to the massacre. According to Becker, Capri apartments made no effort to notify Rodger’s roommates of his past switches despite knowing of Rodger’s prior roommate issues.</p>\n<p>“Despite the defendant’s knowledge of Rodger’s bizarre and violent behavior, they … withheld their knowledge of Rodger’s sadistic behavior,” Becker said.</p>\n<p>According to Becker, it was difficult for Wang, Hong and Chen to protect themselves in the assigned living situation, and generally there should be a “higher standard of investigation to protect these individuals.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not a typical situation where you have somebody across the hall from you in another apartment where you can lock the door, and you can be away from them,” Becker said. “You’re locked inside with this person. That standard wasn’t done and because of that, these three innocent boys and other innocent victims in Santa Barbara were killed.”</p>\n<p>Partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas Patrick McNicholas said the lawsuit claims that actions taken by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s department prior to and during the welfare check also put Wang, Hong and Chen in danger.</p>\n<p>“The second claim is a federal constitutional claim and the theory against the sheriff’s department in this case actually increased the danger to the roommates and their guest, because they were in a position of safety, they were outside of the apartment, they were at school while the welfare check was going on,” McNicholas said.</p>\n<p>According to McNicholas, the easily accessible “knowable information” that the officers failed to check include videos online, evidence of weaponry purchases and a concerned phone call to the Sheriff’s Office from Rodger’s mother. McNicholas said these items should have prompted the officers to do more than question Rodger at the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“With the social media that had been uploaded, with the fact that Elliot Rodger had purchased weapons and ammunition, with the fact that you had a mom who called because she was so concerned about the mental, emotional and psychological state of her son,” McNicholas said. “A welfare check was initiated, and a cache of weapons and ammunition was probably 15 to 20 feet away from the sheriffs who came to the door and they never got through the door.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover declined to comment but issued a statement on the matter.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office cannot comment on a matter of pending litigation, and anything we might say in response would be insufficient when measured against the grief suffered by the families of those killed so tragically on May 23, 2014,” Hoover said in a statement. “Nevertheless, we continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers, and to extend our deepest sympathies to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Wang, there should be new law enforcement requirements and standards set in place to ensure welfare checks include investigations into weapon possession as well as online and social media searches.</p>\n<p>“We believe the procedures in the current police system are outdated and should be repaired to protect innocent lives in today’s world,” Wang said. “For example, a welfare check system must be complete and thorough. It should have a weapons check and internet profile search as a mandatory step.”</p>\n<p>Wang said that, as a mother, she hopes the Sheriff’s Department takes more care to prevent future incidents like that May 23 massacre to happen again, though she was unable to protect her own son.</p>\n<p>“I speak to you with a mother’s heart,” Wang said. “I’m fully supported by the other two mothers of the victims. We love our children with all our hearts. We will love other children with all our mind. We wish we could rely on ourselves to save our sons. We weren’t given the chance, but now we do everything we can to save other children before it’s too late. And that is our way of remembering our sons.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/","id":4749,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4748,4747,4746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

This week, stakeholders discussed the details of possible taxes, including a User Utility Tax (UUT) that taxes residents a percentage of their utility bills, and the borders of I.V., specifically regarding whether students living in university-owned housing should be integrated into self-governance plans and be taxed accordingly.</p>\n<p>Community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said after researching Santa Barbara’s use of UUT’s, she found cell phones would be an effective utility to tax in the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“I got the detailed numbers of how much they [Santa Barbara] get for each utility,” Elliott said. “By far their biggest one is cellphones, it’s over a million dollars [in tax revenue per year].”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said including cell phones in an I.V. UUT would prove ineffective because most students’ cell phones are not registered at their I.V. residence address.</p>\n<p>“The little bit of research that’s been done in Isla Vista shows most of the cell phones in Isla Vista are paid for at an addresses outside of Isla Vista,” Thurlow said. “You should look at cellular income with skepticism that it would be anywhere near that much.

CSD.</p>\n<p>“If there is a tax then it needs to be for a specific purpose and there’s no legal definition for specific purpose, for most CSD’s they have interpreted that as one service,” Abboud said. “I’ve been calling around different CSD’s around the state to see if anyone has a tax for more than one [service] but I haven’t found one yet.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she is uncomfortable giving freshmen the power to vote within the proposed CSD and would like to include the more permanent faculty housing community.</p>\n<p>“I have a concern about freshmen who are just coming in, having never had any experience with this community, voting on things,” Soutar said. “If there was any group on campus that I would want to include it would be the faculty housing because I feel like the faculty housing has more interaction [with Isla Vista] and they’ve been around a long time.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman also said he does not want residents on university property included in I.V. self-governance because it can be difficult to enforce local policies on a state-owned campus and the university has been reluctant to associate with I.V.</p>\n<p>“Even if we claim it’s in the boundaries, it isn’t really in the boundaries because we don’t have the same power over it as all the rest of the land,” Freeman said. “UCSB even treats themselves separately, they try to solve problems in I.V. by putting on events on campus and separating them.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he would like to see on-campus students included in I.V. self-governance to encourage future participation in I.V. government.</p>\n<p>“If we’re talking about transiency and people not getting involved early enough and not wanting to get involved, barring their ability to vote or make any decisions is probably going to guarantee that they never get involved,” Schunk said. “I would only agree to this on the condition that UCSB agrees to pay taxes for those residences.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the decision to include on-campus resident students’ voices in I.V. government should depend on whether or not the university is willing to pay residency taxes at the same rate as I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“I think what it really comes down to for me, is if they’re paying taxes at the same rate everyone else is, then I’m ok with them having a vote,” Gould said. “But I don’t see that happening; I don’t see the university allowing us to tax the on-campus dorms with the utility user’s tax or a bedroom tax, whatever it is at the same rate as Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Williams will be hosting a town hall meeting on Saturday at St. Michael’s University Church to discuss with Isla Vista residents how set up a governing board for an I.V.

Trash-collectors concluded the clean-up by watching the sun set along the I.V. coastline.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and outreach and education coordinator for the Coastal Fund Kylie Taylor said it is important to clean I.V. beaches regularly because of the university research conducted in these areas.</p>\n<p>“We like to clean the beach as much as we can – at least once a quarter at minimum,” Taylor said. “Our organization is so focused on funding research projects in the coastline. It is important to our statement and values to keep it clean as we help people do their research in the coastal regions of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Taylor also said alcohol-related activities increase local waste in the ocean – specifically by allowing broken glass, bottles and cans to collect on the beach.</p>\n<p>“Some of it can be blamed on alcohol,” Taylor said. “You can see broken glass in the streets of Isla Vista that gets transferred onto the beach. Some students also toss bottles and cans into the sand area after playing Frisbee. We want to get rid of these wastes as much as we can because we know that alcohol can be a factor in making the beaches dirtier.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Alex Germann attended the beach clean-up and said it made him feel like he was “making a difference … especially after a Friday night.”</p>\n<p>“After cleaning the ocean, I definitely feel good about myself – as an individual and that I helped out the community,” Germann said.</p>\n<p>According to Germann, conducting a quarterly beach clean-up not only benefits the environment, but also has positive implications for safety.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the mess, I feel like it is not done on purpose, but sometimes it tends to happen,” Germann said. “If we volunteer to help and clean up, it is actually better for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and Coastal Fund outreach and education coordinator Kevin Lou said the beach was not a big part of his life prior to attending the university, but that, after moving to the area, he has learned that the ocean has a lot to offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“Before coming out to UCSB, I [lived] too far from the coast so it was not a big part of my life,” Lou said. “But, after moving here it is definitely a big part of every person’s life here from the environment to activities in the spring like going to the beach and watching the sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Lou, this beach clean-up differs from previous endeavors in that it took place in the late afternoon instead of the conventional early morning start, allowing volunteers to watch the sunset after clean-up.</p>\n<p>“We, as a group, thought it would be interesting to host this event in the afternoon to see the sunset at the end of the clean-up,” Lou said. “Instead of having it in the morning, we assumed that students do not want to wake up early in the morning in hopes of having a bigger turnout.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Mark Butello said he moved to Isla Vista in 1982 and has been participating in beach clean-ups ever since.</p>\n<p>“I used to walk up and down the beaches with a friend back in 1982 when I got here from Los Angeles,” Butello said. “We would gather up trash and clean it thoroughly.

UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa began the event by taking questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. would have no direct effect on law enforcement in the area.</p>\n<p>“The county is still responsible for law enforcement in this area. What [it would do] though is give the community a voice as far as communicating with the Sheriff’s department, the university police department [and] the university as a whole [as well as] the county as a whole,” Signa said. “It [would give] them more of a voice to say, ‘Hey, this is what we’re looking for. This is the problem we’re having.’”</p>\n<p>Signa also discussed the university’s $70,000 grant to put up fencing along the cliffs. According to Signa, the project received unanimous support because of its promise to improve the safety of residents.</p>\n<p>“The only people that don’t want it are the people say ‘It blocks my view’ or something like that. But everybody else is very much in favor of it,” Signa said. “You got people dying over something like that and it could be easily remedied by a fence.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61442\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1385995212\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61442\" data-attachment-id=\"61442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/pizza-with-a-cop_john-clow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424974568\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pizza With a Cop_John Clow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61442\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Students listen on as Sargent Sigma answers student questions.

John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When asked about prominent crime issues this year, Signa said similar to previous years, almost all arrests and violations can be credited to drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the stats, 95 percent of the people that are arrested are arrested for things involving alcohol,” Signa said. “It’s unfortunate it’s such a party atmosphere out here the amount of alcohol really affects the safety of people.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said in recent years the violence he has seen in I.V. has become “intense.”</p>\n<p>“This shouldn’t be a town where you have stabbings; you shouldn’t have fights where people are going to hospitals, and it’s frustrating to see that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the decreasing crime rates in I.V. are partially a result of the increased presence of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Now, like I mentioned before, the presence … it’s helped. It’s a Band-Aid. It helps fix some of the problems, but it’s not the solution,” Signa said. “We still need to come up with a solution for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Signa said students and residents should not be paranoid about falling victim to a crime, but should also be cautious that I.V. does have a very high crime rate.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing for me — what I want to tell the students and residents, everybody that lives out here — is just watch out for each other,” Signa said. “We’re a community, and community is about taking care of each other.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year physics major Zoltan Urge, the event was well organized and gave I.V. residents an opportunity to connect to local law enforcement in a personal manner.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good outreach to students because recently there’s been a bunch of backlash against the police and this is a good way to reconnect with the community,” Urge said.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Oliver Fahrner approves of the job local law enforcement is doing and said he wishes there were a better way to deal with out-of-town visitors.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any complaints about the officers or law enforcement,” Fahrner said. “My main complaint about Isla Vista is that I wish there was an actual, solid way to combat out-of-towners. I wish there was a way to keep out-of-towners out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-61404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of the Haven at College</em></p></div>\n<p>The Haven at College, an organization that provides sober living homes for college students, plans to open a new sober living facility on Pasado Road in Isla Vista next year called The Haven at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Haven at College, which has already established residences in college towns for USC, Drexel University and the University of Redlands, will house seven students in I.V. seeking to live substance-free lifestyles. The Haven at Santa Barbara would not be a university program, but Gauchos for Recovery and the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program plan to largely endorse the project.</p>\n<p>According to The Haven at College co-founder Holly Sherman, The Haven will open its doors in July and thus far has one student committed to living there. Although The Haven is currently “working on the math,” Sherman said the cost of staying at this sober living house will be roughly higher than living in an on-campus dorm.</p>\n<p>“There is an additional fee for the services we provide,” Sherman said. “It’s a little above the cost of room and board at a dorm.”</p>\n<p>Sherman said students living at The Haven will be treated with peer support programs and clinician care in order to facilitate effective recovery and ensure a healthy environment for residents.</p>\n<p>“We are a supportive group,” Sherman said. “The most practical measure is that it’s run by students — we hire students who are great role models of recovery.”<br>\nThe Haven at College co-founder Sharon Weber said The Haven at Santa Barbara was established through connections made with the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program after working with the UC Office of the President in the fall.</p>\n<p>“We had been in dialogue with the UC system and it was through that exposure that we met some of the people involved in the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program at UCSB,” Weber said. “They were the ones that invited us to come up and engage in some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program director Jackie Kurta, she first heard of The Haven at College when she picked up educational literature about the program at a conference in the fall. Kurta said establishing a sober living facility in I.V. seemed like “good timing,” given the difficult past year and changing attitude of I.V. towards safety and health.</p>\n<p>“It felt to me like this would be a wonderful opportunity for us here in Isla Vista,” Kurta said. “We contacted them and they were very enthusiastic, and they really were very interested in checking out the possibilities here.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said she favors the recovery program administered at The Haven at College because it is specifically catered toward college students seeking to abstain from drug and alcohol use.</p>\n<p>“Their program is just such an excellent one,” Kurta said. “It really takes into consideration the specific needs of students in a college setting, as opposed to another traditional sober living facility which serves a kind of broad spectrum of ages and lifestyles.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, The Haven at Santa Barbara will act as a supportive body to aid students seeking to refrain from substance abuse rather than as a “policing body.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything against drugs and alcohol; we believe they have their place in the college life,” Weber said. “But if you have a problem with them and they’re kicking your ass, then you’re welcome to come to The Haven at Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>UCLA alumnus Danny Buchan said he has been living at The Haven at USC for two years since seeking recovery from his drug addiction and is now four years clean.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t do something, I would have died, or much less be able to go to school or live a constructive life, so I went to treatment and I got into recovery,” Buchan said. “Now that I’ve gone into recovery, I can enjoy life at the moment and be more connected to the world and people around me.”</p>\n<p>Buchan said he works as The Haven at USC house manager, where he administers recovery practices such as weekly 12-step programs, frequent breathalyzing, random urine tests and a temporary curfew.</p>\n<p>“There are accountability measures that we have just to assure the safety of The Haven and to make sure that everyone is staying sober and that everyone’s on the right track,” Buchan said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A more permanent solution—of wood fences up to four-and-a-half feet tall—will be supported by $70,000 from UCSB, the university announced Tuesday. <em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The university said it will cover the entire estimated cost for the installation of the fences and has agreed that if the project comes in under budget, the remaining funds will be used by the county for maintaining the fence. The fences will run from the end of Del Playa Open Space Park to Walter Capps Park and will include all parks owned by the county and the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD). Once the fence is completed, the county will assume responsibility for future maintenance and repairs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement in the fencing project since the death of multiple students from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/cliff-fall-victim-paralyzed-from-waist-down/\">cliff falls</a> in 2013 has largely contributed to the university’s decision to provide funding to the county.</p>\n<p>“Chancellor Yang has been deeply involved in this project since the beginning, when Molly Morrison founded Fence Isla Vista, and since we lost students to cliff-related deaths and injuries,” Schunk said. “Yang has taken a very active and involved role in this entire effort so I think part of it was him pushing it and making it a top priority.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological sciences major and Fence I.V. founder Molly Morrison said she founded her organization, which aims to improve current fencing standards along the cliffs on Del Playa Drive, after her friend and <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/woman-found-on-isla-vista-beach-identified-as-cal-poly-slo-student/\">Cal Poly SLO student Giselle Ayala</a>, along with three other students, died after falling from the cliffs since April 2013.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s extremely vital to make these occurrences as preventable as possible,” Morrison said. “I do believe the personal responsibility is also an extremely vital aspect in these scenarios, but there is work to be done on both ends to help end these tragedies.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said she believes the university decided to fund the project due to Santa Barbara county’s historical lack of funding to improve fencing along the I.V. cliffs.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that they have been inactive, but that it has taken so long to find a source of funding that should normally be very fast, as fencing is one of the largest safety concerns in Santa Barbara area,” Morrison said. “[UCSB’s contribution] is extremely helpful, as it is funding the entire project. I am so grateful for the generous donors who have dedicated their resources to help make this place safer.”</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD general manager Rodney Gould, the university’s contribution to the project is critical to its timely completion because the project was not a budgeted expense for the district and therefore was difficult to fund. Gould said construction should begin shortly given the end of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>“I know the funding has been received by the County and they are in discussions with a contractor,” Gould said in an email. “My best guess, and it is only a guess, is that construction will begin in the next few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the fences installed along the bluffs will be three-ring wood fences up to 54 inches high with diamond-shaped, nylon-coated chain links to prevent someone from being able to climb over the fence.</p>\n<p>“The idea for the small diamonds is so you can’t fit your hands or toes into it easily and climb over it,” Schunk said. “The thing to keep in mind is we aren’t going for a high security fence because we’re looking at prevention.”</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the university and the county have been working on installing I.V. bluff fencing since last Fall and that the recent funding will finally ensure the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>“I asked the chancellor last October in a letter to fund a couple of county projects, starting with the bluff fencing, and the county said that we would do the maintenance once it was installed,” Farr said. “It’s on our agenda for next week so I’m really happy to see that it’s finally coming together.”</p>\n<p>Farr also said the county wants to make open park spaces on DP as safe as possible in light historical cliff falls resulting in the death of multiple students since 2005.</p>\n<p>“We warn people about the danger of the bluffs and although there have always been some kind of a fence up there to deter people, they either obey the signs or go around the fencing and walk on the other side,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, many individuals do not take into account that the cliffs’ eroding nature make their edges particularly dangerous for people treading the Del Playa bluffs.</p>\n<p>“People also need to understand that the geologic material of those bluffs are very erosive so they’re constantly crumbling away. I think that’s another reason why people might make the mistake sometimes and think there’s more property on the other side of the fence than there really is,” Farr said. “So we’re constantly monitoring it from a public safety standpoint from the beach side as well as from the upper side.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the university’s contribution is helpful, he hopes it is more than a one-time effort to improve safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I hope this influx of funds towards I.V. and level of attention is not temporary because of the events last spring, but history tells us it is,” Abboud said in an email. “I’m optimistic that this time around we can come up with a long term solution that keeps everyone involved and helping better Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Cameron Schunk stating a preference for a high security fence. Schunk actually said the fence were for prevention, not high security purposes.

Phi Sigma Kappa was placed on interim university suspension and was under investigation in late January due to alleged violations of university policy and conduct deemed inconsistent with the fraternity’s founding principles. The fraternity is the second Greek life organization to lose its charter campus since the academic year began, <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/beta-theta-pi-suspended-after-alcohol-incident/comment-page-1/\">with Beta Theta Pi losing its charter in December</a>.</p>\n<p>Inter-fraternity Council President Carl Provenzano said the closure of the chapter was an agreement between the university, alumni and the national organization.</p>\n<p>“The school follows the judgment of the national organization and no longer recognizes them on our campus,” Provenzano said in an email. “The investigation is over and the chapter has officially closed down.”</p>\n<p>According to Provenzano, while he believes members of the fraternity are constructive members of the community, the national chapter is concerned with the chapter’s multiple policy violations.</p>\n<p>“The men in Phi Sigma Kappa are a phenomenal group of guys,” Provenzano said in an email. “They are leaders on campus and in the community. Many of them are and will remain close friends of mine. Their national organization revoked their charter because they felt the local chapter was violating risk management policies and UCSB policy.”</p>\n<p>In a release sent out by Director of Fraternities and Sororities at the Office of Student Life Kristin Van Ramshorst, Phi Sigma Kappa has been revoked for participating in activities harmful to students as well as to new members of the fraternity.</p>\n<p>“Due to unsafe new member education practices and perpetuation of an unsafe environment for UCSB community members, the International Fraternity has deemed closure necessary to ensure the health and safety of their active and new members,” the release stated.</p>\n<p>Provenzano said he remains optimistic for the future of the Greek community despite several undesirable incidents this past year.</p>\n<p>“It has been a tough year for Greeks, but we are not going anywhere on this campus and wish to move in a more positive and upward direction in the coming years,” Provenzano said in an email.</p>\n<p>President of the Signet Housing Corporation Daryl Lu, who owns the property that formerly existed as the Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity house, said the chapter has been around for nearly five decades and has contributed positively to the campus community in the past.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Phi Sig chapter has been a positive member of the campus community, providing leadership in student government, the Interfraternity Council, and other campus organizations,” Lu said in an email. “The reputation that we earned and valued has been seriously damaged by the failure of the chapter to abide by our principles.”</p>\n<p>According to Lu, while actions taken to remove Sigma Kappa’s charter were necessary, he hopes other Greek organizations will not be affected by Phi Sigma Kappa’s suspension.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our fraternity, we apologize for conduct by some of the undergraduates that can unfairly cast a negative impression on other Greek organizations,” Lu said. “We know full well that fraternities and sororities, when operated consistent with their principles, play a highly constructive role in enriching the lives of their members.”</p>\n<p>Members of the fraternity refused to provide comment for this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic to further discuss potential services and funding that a Community Services District (CSD) would entail.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, university administrators and members of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors have been meeting weekly for the past several months to discuss Williams’s I.V. self-governance bill AB 3, which was introduced in December to establish I.V. as a CSD which can potentially levy taxes in order to provide residents certain infrastructure and services. Currently, the group is discussing the details of a potential I.V. CSD to fund graffiti removal, bluff fencing and other services.</p>\n<p>According to Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Doreen Farr, the county does not provide adequate funding for graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have money for graffiti abatement so every year what I do is go to UCSB for $2,000, go to the county for $2,000 and the property owners for $2,500,” Aguilera said. “This year the I.V. Property Association did not give us $2,500 so I had to find somewhere that amount. Every year we have to go through this process. The county is not set up to do graffiti abatement.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera said while the county does partially fund graffiti abatement services for I.V., funding is not guaranteed in the future.</p>\n<p>“You have someone in the third district who actively is asking for money and that’s how graffiti is being taken care of, but when the third district supervisor is no longer there, it’s going to be a problem,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<p>According to second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, the county does not have adequate funding mechanisms in place to provide much needed fencing for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it kind of shows some of the pitfalls of the [county] services,” Minoiefar said. “In the part that says ‘sexual assaults and riots,’ maybe mention cliff falls and things like that. … We can’t even keep people from falling from the cliffs.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera also said the addition of bluff-side fencing around parks on Del Playa Drive should be included into the jurisdiction of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“What about adding fence maintenance as one of the powers? And then you would have control of that fence,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61298\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61298\" data-attachment-id=\"61298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/das-williams_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424816365\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61298\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2-683x1024.jpg?resize=327%2C491\" alt=\"(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"327\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould said the county should remain responsible for funding maintenance of the fences.</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to take that on,” Gould said. “IVRPD owns some of the parks. The county owns the rest of them and they’re responsible for paying for that. There’s no reason we should be absorbing that.”</p>\n<p>According to community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott, the ideas stakeholders brainstormed at the meeting will be used to flesh out the specifics of AB 3 in the near future.</p>\n<p>“This is just placeholder language to get into committee right now,” Elliott said. “This isn’t the big enchilada. This would never pass out of committee because there is no funding mechanism to provide all these services. This is so that we can keep the bill alive.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and IVRPD board member Paola De La Cruz said she is concerned about the proposed utility users tax, which would charge I.V. residents a percentage of their utility bills to fund services and could affect small households.</p>\n<p>“I live with one roommate. There’s only two of us but there is no gas; we only pay electricity,” De La Cruz said. “Our bill is a high amount, usually about $150 for electricity. The amount of money we would be paying compared to another house with five students is going to be higher.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the goal of the proposed utility user tax is to create a tax that is fairly distributed.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are having this discussion is to put the burden most fairly on the most amount of people,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board member Pegeen Soutar said a per-bedroom tax is preferable to a utility users tax to fairly divide the payment of local taxes.</p>\n<p>“Parks and Rec has a bedroom tax and that’s the majority of our funding, and it’s $94 a year, and that’s down by a two-thirds vote by taxpayers in the community,” Soutar said. “The landowners pay it, but in all reality that’s passed on by rent. I look at that as a very equitable way to place a tax.”</p>\n<p>According to De La Cruz, the stakeholders’ town hall meeting held last Saturday in Anisq’oyo’ Park was successful in including more students in the process of discussing self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I loved having it at the park,” De La Cruz said. “I saw some people I think were students just walking by and sitting out on the small hill just listening to conversations that were happening. I wish we would have had time for actual discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/","id":4740,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4739,4738,4737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

First Friday planners were initially organizing a larger-than-average version of the event with multiple stages but ran into issues once Santa Barbara County approved noise ordinances during the first two weekends of April in order to prevent this year’s Deltopia from becoming disorderly. I.V. First Friday is coordinated by I.V. Open Lab, a project-based course offered by the university’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and sponsored by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) and the I.V. Food Co-Op. The event is hosted as a late-night alternative to what many students call the “I.V. party scene,” and is held the first Friday of every month at Perfect Park, featuring live local music, artwork, improvisation and dance performances and more.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, the original plan for the First Friday on April 3 was to have a number of groups and organizations co-host a block party that would have been larger than most First Fridays to date.</p>\n<p>“We were actually considering fencing off the entire end of the loop and having multiple stages with varying forms of entertainment operating simultaneously,” Gould said in an email. “Before we got very far into the planning, we realized we couldn’t proceed due to the festival ordinance that was put into place for Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Gould said the original proposal for I.V. First Friday was suggested in anticipation of the influx of people expected to come to I.V. during Deltopia weekend, which attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers in last April. </p>\n<p>“We figured that there would be a lot of people in town that night,” Gould said in an email. “The University has planned a lot of things Saturday as alternatives, but there was nothing on Friday, so we thought this might take some of the burden off the Del Playa partying.”</p>\n<p>Gould said I.V. Open Lab is now exploring the possibility of having an art show in the early evening of April 3 at the I.V. Clinic building that would feature I.V.’s “hidden art community.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of resident artists in Isla Vista that people just don’t know about that have been here for years, so we thought it would be kind of fun to showcase that,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the students of I.V. Open Lab are also discussing organizing a silent movie series and a silent disco, though the plans for the First Friday to be held on April 3 are still dependent on approval from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out a mellow, outdoor lounge-like event for that Friday,” Yasuda said. “We also want it to be local, so that’s why we’re showcasing the resident artists’ artwork. The visual display is quiet, the disco is quiet and then we thought about silent movies.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and I.V. Open Lab student Itxy Quintanilla said it was disappointing to learn the initial plans for the First Friday on April 3 could not be executed.</p>\n<p>“We are saving those plans for a future month,” Quintanilla said in an email. “We understand the reason for the implementation of these ordinances, but it has been difficult to work around them.”</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said she is hopeful the newly proposed events will be approved by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“After throwing around several ideas and discussing the ordinances, we hope that our movie in the park proposal will meet the guidelines and provide a safe and engaging community gathering,” Quintanilla said in an email. “Hopefully our plans are approved in order to create another successful event.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said the collaboration between students, faculty, residents and local businesses is what makes First Fridays special, and she hopes the First Friday scheduled for the night of April 3 can still take place.</p>\n<p>“We want it to happen and we think it’s going to be great and attract the right kind of people,” Yasuda said. “We feel it is really important to have programming that is creative, safe and alternative, because if you have nothing, then that’s when the trouble starts.” Yasuda said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/","id":4739,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4738,4737,4736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Community Meets for Year’s Second Town Hall, Brainstorms I.V.

Taxation will fund I.V. public services including improved lighting and a parking program, among others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61226\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61226\" data-attachment-id=\"61226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/das-williams-discussing-the-bill-with-a-community-member/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424480668\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"97\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.

Attendees also favored the possible implementation of a parking program to generate additional revenues, as well as the establishment of a rental-tenant mediation board to sort out issues between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>Utilities taxable under most models presented at the meeting include water, internet, cable, gas and trash with special exemptions to low-income families under certain models.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill language includes powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission similar to one existing in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee (SBCC) and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the three most likely types of tax for I.V. students and residents are a utilities tax; a creative sales deliveries tax, which refers to marijuana dispensary delivery taxes; and parcel taxes, which tax properties and are primarily used to fund public education.</p>\n<p>“I think what was presented here were great,” Abboud said. “The ideas were helpful and I think the utilities tax will be the number one idea and we should definitely have that one. The creative sales deliveries tax will be good as well, which involves marijuana. A small parcel tax will also work.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the marijuana tax could be beneficial for I.V. residents because many users and non-users alike favor taxing marijuana for city revenue.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, a marijuana tax came up a lot and the utilities tax is the most popular,” Williams said. “Marijuana advocates believe that it should be taxed and it seems like they mean it; this would also help students out. It can also be paid for.”</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said he does not support the utilities tax, which charges utility users for consumption of electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, sanitation and cable television. According to McDonough, he would have to spend more money on necessary utilities to keep his coffee business afloat.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the utilities tax,” McDonough said. “I own a coffee shop and I use so much utility every day. A utilities tax raise would cost me more money.”</p>\n<p>McDonough also said he does not see the reason behind transient taxes, a tax aimed at out-of-towners who stay at a hotel or motel, because there are no hotels in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As for the transient tax, we do not even have any hotels in Isla Vista so I do not see the point in transient taxes,” McDonough said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he believes the proposed party registration tax is not a “real” tax because it is not implemented anywhere else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61229\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61229\" data-attachment-id=\"61229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/community-members-brainstorm-ideas-for-service-funding/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424482130\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Community members, such as Jay Freeman, above, brainstorm ideas for service funding.

LAFCO is a state-mandated agency present in every California county to oversee the formation of CSDs. AB 3 would establish, by act of the state legislature, an I.V. CSD and thereby bypass the traditional role of LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>The letter was drafted and released at LAFCO’s Feb. 5 meeting and enumerates 11 concerns held by the commission over the bill, primarily regarding the bill’s current lack of specificity over the types of services that would be available in an I.V. CSD and how they would be paid for. Additional concerns questioned the role of the county, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and UCSB in a CSD, the makeup of the administrative board in a CSD and how the CSD would be governed after it is formed.</p>\n<p>The commission heard over two dozen speakers during its roughly hour-long public comment period, with primarily I.V. residents, property owners and students voicing their concerns. Following public comment, the commission debated the merits of sending the letter, with commissioners Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf along with LAFCO chair and Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr voicing opposition.</p>\n<p>Commissioners Craig Geyer, Jeff Moorhouse, Roger Aceves, Roger Welt and Jim Richardson voted in favor of issuing the letter, with Farr and Wolf voting against.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61164\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61164\" data-attachment-id=\"61164\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/doreen-farr-speaks-at-the-lafco-meeting-on-february-19th/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424355612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"220\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61164\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on Feb. 19.

We already have law enforcement there,” Mitchell said. “We have a government that deals with those issues already … by creating more government you are asking the students to pay more, you are asking the residents to pay more … we have enough government in Isla Vista already.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61165\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61165\" data-attachment-id=\"61165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/lafco_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424356580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61165\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.

By overturning our role in the process to a board like LAFCO we remove our hand from this important step.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also said LAFCO should work to ease tensions between residents of I.V. and LAFCO in order to allow the community to address the concerns the commission is taking on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have some trust issues with you all and I would feel that as a board who is made to represent the interests and assert the interests of local districts you would all be willing to compromise with us on that and understand that,” Schunk said. “By allowing us the determination of continuing these talks … you allow us to move forward and answer the very questions you have presented.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman has agreed to work on a financial feasibility study for an I.V. CSD, and sociology professor Victor Rios has begun an effort to attain $18,000 of university money to fund a demographics study of I.V., to meet the concerns of the LAFCO. Schunk and other speakers also encouraged LAFCO commissioners attend the weekly stakeholders meetings taking place in I.V. to flesh out the specifics of the bill.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Geyer said LAFCO members may be limited in their ability to attend stakeholders meetings because of the Brown Act, a piece of legislation guaranteeing the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>“It is hard for commissioners to come to meetings because of the Brown Act,” Geyer said. “We can violate the Brown Act in a very easy manner and I think that’s probably why a lot of us don’t attend.”</p>\n<p>Following public comment, commissioner Moorhouse said LAFCO’s purpose is to create local governments and to encourage county, state and university administrations to assist in demographic and financial feasibility studies.</p>\n<p>“Opposing AB 3 does not mean that LAFCO opposes I.V. self-governance,” Moorhouse said, “LAFCO exists to create local governance, among other things. We are here to help and there is an established process to follow and it works.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2006 law updating the CSD formation process, part of LAFCO’s role in creating a CSD is to ensure 25 percent of residents of the proposed CSD area sign a petition indicating support for the effort.</p>\n<p>Geyer said LAFCO’s role is to ensure public participation in the CSD formation process and expressed concern about inaccessibility of the bill once it moves along in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>“The formation of anything, any special district in Isla Vista, should come back to the local LAFCO. That’s what we are here for. That’s why the legislature invented LAFCO, and LAFCO locally [allows] the public to be involved,” Geyer said. “When this thing heads up to Sacramento, you think you have a hard time making it here [to downtown Santa Barbara], you’re gonna have a real hard time making it up there.”</p>\n<p>The commission amended the several points on the letter before approving it for release. The commission eliminated the first sentence on point three, which falsely stated the bill was introduced in December without public outreach on the concept, when in fact two town hall-style meetings had occurred in the months prior to determine an appropriate form of local government for I.V.</p>\n<p>The commission amended language on point three to reflect concerns that LAFCO would be bypassed as a result of “commission meetings” rather than “community meetings” because of a lack of familiarity with the content of the stakeholders and town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>On item nine, the commission deleted the final sentence, which stated “LAFCO has no authority to deviate from the CSD law regarding makeup of the CSD board” and inserted, “However, if it is determined that state legislation is needed, it could be requested by Santa Barbara LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>On item 11, the language was changed from “if the Isla Vista CSD is formed with LAFCO approval” to “if Isla Vista CSD is formed without LAFCO approval, would the district be subject to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act after the … CSD is formed?”</p>\n<p>Finally, the commission agreed to issue the revised letter undersigned by LAFCO executive officer Paul Hood, rather than LAFCO chair Farr, who opposed moving forward with the letter and had her name signed to the draft released Feb. 5.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/","id":4791,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[4790,4789,4788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Assemblyman Holds I.V.

That’s my endgame.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, all individuals invested in the I.V. community are invited to participate in town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“Eventually, everyone who will be here will always have this government to help us aid them,” Minoeifar said. “So, just because you’re not going to be here when you graduate doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be here.
