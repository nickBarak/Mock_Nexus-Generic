Supporters climbed a ladder on the side of the Co-op building to see the newly installed panels on the roof. Afterward, groups celebrated by cutting a giant ribbon with a pair of scissors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco-based nonprofit RE-volv started the Solar Ambassador Program as a way to help organizations and businesses switch to renewable energy. The one-year program takes college students and trains them in finance, management, crowdfunding and community engagement in a four-day retreat in Tomales Bay near San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv, said the ceremony was a way of raising awareness about renewable energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A project like this and a ribbon-cutting like this is [sic] really meant to show all the customers that come here, all the community members, all the students in Isla Vista at Santa Barbara, that solar power works,” Karelas said. “It saves the Co-op money, it can save you money and it’s something that we could all get behind and get involved with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Solar Ambassador team started their project in 2015. After signing the lease with the Co-op in the fall, the team raised $59,261 in donations during a crowdfunding campaign in the spring of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Godfrey, a fourth-year environmental studies major and one of the solar ambassadors, said she’s happy that the project is finished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited to see everything come to a close,” Godfrey said. “My favorite thing about the project was seeing the love and support that the community has for the Co-op. You don’t really see that until you tell them about something and then their face lights up, and it’s really awesome to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Solar Ambassador team commissioned Sun Pacific Solar Electric, a local solar contracting company, to build 100 solar panels capable of generating 24 kilowatts of energy each. The panels officially began supplying power on May 17 and have been able to generate approximately a third of the grocery store’s energy usage since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a 20-year lease term, the Isla Vista Food Co-op plans to pay off the cost of its solar panels gradually over time. Representatives from RE-volv said this current plan cuts the Co-op’s electricity bill by 15-percent.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78309\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78309\" data-attachment-id=\"78309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-05/i-v-food-co-op-takes-powerful-step-with-solar-panel-installation/dsc_0260/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0260\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Isla Vista Food Co-op installed solar panels, which now account for a third of the store’s electricity needs. <em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaylan Lamb, a fourth-year environmental studies major and the project leader, said the project was possible because of the cooperation among the different organizations and businesses.</span></p>\n<p>Lamb thanked the RE-volv representatives, Co-op staff and community members who supported the campaign “even when things got rocky.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[RE-volv representatives] were really our sponsors and guardians throughout the whole project and really gave us the motivation in the first place to spearhead the crowdfunding campaign to get the solar panels,” Lamb said. “The Co-op staff were so patient and so cooperative with us … It was really a group effort, and awesome to be able to bring everyone together and celebrate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the ribbon-cutting, a Co-op employee played a tune on the trumpet that was received with cheers from the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Brinker, the associate director of partnership and philanthropy at RE-volv, said the ceremony was personal for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This ceremony has a special place in my heart because I’m from Santa Barbara.

concerns about the way law enforcement deals with cases.</p>\n<p>The town hall began with a description of the CSD and its powers. Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the bill that established the I.V. CSD, allows the district to provide eight specific services, including the ability to “contract” with the county and the UC Regents for “additional police protection services.”</p>\n<p>The CSD’s board is looking to exercise that power to improve public safety, as the amount of reported sexual assaults reached 48 this previous year.</p>\n<p>Members of the public took issue with the way law enforcement distributes information about crimes. During public comment, many said they were worried some crimes were not being reported in UC Police Department (UCPD) timely warnings or in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press releases.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member Daniel Torres began the public comment with concerns about the way law enforcement chooses to distribute information.</p>\n<p>Torres alluded to a crime reported by SBSO in April, when two male subjects allegedly assaulted a 28-year-old man after making comments about his sexual orientation. The event occurred on Sunday of UC Santa Barbara’s pride week, and while SBSO investigated the incident as a hate crime, it did not release a statement immediately.</p>\n<p>Torres said he wished to see more transparency from local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When you are a part of these communities and people in your community are physically getting assaulted because of their identity, that’s something people need to know about ASAP,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Andrew Pragin expressed his own concern over why he did not receive a timely warning email from UCPD about a stabbing this weekend, which UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson addressed by saying the department does not send timely warnings for every incident in I.V.</p>\n<p>Olson said not all incidents are handled by UCPD because its main jurisdiction is the UC Santa Barbara campus and it is not responsible for patrolling all of the I.V. area. UCPD has a crime log on its website of all the incidents the department responds to, he said.</p>\n<p>“I think some of the misunderstanding is that the UCPD or the campus has this overarching obligation to send out timely warning to the I.V. community, and that’s not always the case,” Olson said.</p>\n<p>In reference to the stabbing, Olson said since there were arrests made and there was no more “ongoing risk” to the public, an additional alert is not recommended.</p>\n<p>“They would frown on us just sending out the alerts under those circumstances,” Olson said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78261\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78261\" data-attachment-id=\"78261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/img_0835/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0835\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78261\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>While Olson said additional alerts in these cases are excessive, members of the public express a desire to know more about the process that their cases go through after they are reported to the police.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Batsheva Stoll echoed other speakers’ words on law enforcement transparency.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she and her friends suspected they were being stalked one night in I.V. and reported the incident to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), but she said they did not receive follow-up information about what the authorities were doing to investigate the incident.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she would have liked to know what steps IVFP was taking to investigate the incident and said she believes the public would benefit from understanding the steps law enforcement takes when responding to the public’s concerns.</p>\n<p>“It would be helpful if there was some sort of response system where the person was aware of how it was being dealt with for peace of mind,” Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Among the proposed solutions to the public’s interest in the investigative process was the formation of a civilian review board to internally analyze the work local law enforcement is doing.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann brought into question the way crime is being analyzed, questioning how the law enforcement groups that patrol I.V. are using their data.</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD creates internal reports and discusses strategies to address crime trends at monthly meetings.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve done some bait bike enforcement … We have GPS tracking devices. We certainly see that bike theft is a big issue on campus,” Olson said. “So we do have a number of issues that pop up and we track the data and we look at times and we do deploy officers accordingly.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said while law enforcement agencies are collecting data, the way they currently analyze it leaves room for improvement. She said she met with the County Executive Office to discuss data analysis and found that “internally we don’t do that as well as we should,” and she and believes this is the starting point for addressing crime in I.V.</p>\n<p>CSD board members proposed alternative modes of policing that are intended to be less intimidating than traditional police and would aid in improving public perception of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The board suggested the expansion of the Community Service Officer (CSO) program currently put in place by UCPD as well as creating a “Student Neighborhood Assistance Program” (S.N.A.P.), both of which work as intermediaries between police and the public.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s presentation on public safety, S.N.A.P. would use student works as “first responders” to noise complaints, which they believe would help deescalate confrontations with police in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/","id":4408,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4407,4406,4405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.

A court date has been set for Sept. 15 of this year. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The parents of UC Santa Barbara students James Hong and David Wang — the shooter’s roommates — and their friend, George Chen, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March 2015 against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Capri Apartments, arguing that their deaths could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>While the Sheriff’s Department has been dropped from the lawsuit, Hi Desert Mobile Home Park L.P., the company that owns Capri Apartments, and Asset Campus Housing (ACH), a third-party student housing property management company, are still on the lawsuit and will face trial on Sept. 15.</p>\n<p>The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but it was rejected this year on Feb. 10.</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, the two L.A.-based law firms representing the victims’ parents, claimed negligence and wrongful death against the two companies, which they believe should have properly vetted Elliot Rodger before assigning him to be Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>According to court documents obtained by the Nexus, the parents’ original complaint against the two companies alleged Capri Apartments was warned Rodger was a “violent and dangerous threat to his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Allegedly, the apartment company “had actual and constructive knowledge of his bizarre behavior,” yet still did not conduct a “reasonable investigation” before assigning him as Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that [the two companies], through their on-site management personnel, were aware that law enforcement officers had come to Apt. #7 due to a dispute between Rodger and his roommates,” according to the original 2015 complaint.</p>\n<p>The complaint says as a result of the two companies’ “negligence,” Hong, Wang and Chen were “rendered completely vulnerable” to Rodger and “subjected to his violent acts, which caused their deaths.”</p>\n<p>The families are suing for any psychological, emotional or physical pain caused by the deaths of the three victims and are seeking compensation as “the Court deems just and proper.”</p>\n<p>“[The parents of Chen, Hong and Wang] have incurred funeral and burial expenses and suffered extreme and severe distress, pain, anguish and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hong and Wang were assigned to Apt. #7 at Capri Apartments of Seville Road in September 2013 despite several complaints from Rodger’s old roommates about his mental well-being.</p>\n<p>In late 2011, Rodger was assigned two Hispanic male roommates who he said were “rowdy, inferior, pig-faced thugs,” according to his manifesto. Within days of meeting them, he insulted them and told them he was “superior,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>In September of 2011, Rodger was assigned a new roommate who, a few months later, “began to fear for his personal safety,” according to the complaint the parents’ lawyers filed.</p>\n<p>According to the roommate’s complaint to the apartment complex, “Living with Eliot [sic] is like living with a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only way to solve this problem is by removing it. We are at the point where I fear for my safety.”</p>\n<p>The parents’ lawyers claim in a Feb. 10, 2017, court document that the three victims “simply would not have been killed” if the companies had complied with “basic industry standards and at a reasonable level of care.”</p>\n<p>A representative from Capri Apartments said they were uncomfortable commenting on the case but could say “the management company has changed since 2014.”</p>\n<p>Patrick McNicholas, partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, said “the apartment was completely lacking in training its onsite managers in issues of safety, on issues of matching roommates, in issues making sure that the roommates were safe.”</p>\n<p>“The parents are very hopeful their children will not have died in vain,” he said.</p>\n<p>McNicholas also said the parents hope companies with similar business models will take student safety seriously and implement proper policies and procedures to prevent similar events.</p>\n<p>“They’re moving forward with their lives, but they are beyond devastated,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, May 25, 2017, edition of

that Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, wrote “The Crystal Ship” one night in Isla Vista during the 1960s when he was dropping acid on the beach and looking out at the bright, glimmering Platform Holly just off the coast.</p>\n<p>Now it appears the crystal ship will soon be sailing away.</p>\n<p>Venoco, Inc., the Denver-based oil company which owned Platform Holly, relinquished the oil platform and the rest of its holdings in the South Ellwood Oil Field to the state just before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.</p>\n<p>The oil platform has been inactive since the 2015 Refugio oil spill, when a Plains All American Pipeline ruptured and spilled 142,000 gallons of oil along the Gaviota Coast.</p>\n<p>The pipeline that burst, Line 901, fed oil to and from Platform Holly.</p>\n<p>The closure of Line 901 for the next two years decimated Venoco’s operations in the South Ellwood Oil Field and substantially curbed the company’s financial strength.</p>\n<p>The California State Lands Commission (SLC) now owns Platform Holly and announced in April that it will begin decommissioning the oil platform as soon as possible, a process that it said will be “expensive,” “complex” and “lengthy.”</p>\n<p>The SLC said it would soon begin the process of contracting a project manager to oversee the decommissioning process. The state agency estimates it will take approximately three years to fully decommission and remove Holly, but this estimate is “heavily dependent” on the availability of funding and equipment and the length of time it takes to identify the environmental impacts of removing the oil platform.</p>\n<p>Bob Evans, a local ocean photographer, spoke out to KEYT last week in opposition to a complete removal of Platform Holly, insisting that doing so would harm the marine life dwelling around the columns below.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lifetime taking underwater pictures in the California Channel Islands and I have never seen the amount of life that exists on these platforms, and it would be a travesty to remove these structures,” Evans told KEYT. “I am wondering who’s going to give the eviction notice to all the little creatures that live on Platform Holly?”</p>\n<p>Evans suggests the state remove only the top portion of the platform to keep the lower part as a marine sanctuary, KEYT reported.</p>\n<p>Still, decommissioning Holly comes as a major victory for local environmental efforts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77893\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1524158438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77960\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77893\" data-attachment-id=\"77893\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/farewell-holly/img_9920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77893\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“We have waited for this day for a long time,” Fran Farina of the local Sierra Club chapter said in a statement released the same day Venoco filed for bankruptcy.<br>\nARCO first constructed Platform Holly in 1966, and the oil rig reached peak production in 1984.</p>\n<p>Farina said that the Sierra Club has been combating offshore drilling in the area since the 1980s, when ARCO was looking build additional oil platforms near Holly.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Environmental Defense Center said in April that local environmental groups were “celebrating” the announcement of Platform Holly’s removal, explaining that Holly and other oil infrastructure in the area “pose a threat to public health and the environment.”</p>\n<p>Upon the removal of Platform Holly, there will be 26 offshore oil platforms remaining off the California coast between Orange County and Santa Barbara County, The Mercury News reported.</p>\n<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama implemented in November a temporary moratorium on all new offshore oil drilling off the California coast until 2022.</p>\n<p>Several California lawmakers applauded the decision but called on Obama to institute a permanent ban in light of Donald Trump’s promises to expand offshore oil drilling.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump has not made any tangible steps toward lifting Obama’s ban, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in March that opening federal waters for oil drilling is “a pillar of President Trump’s plan to make the United States energy independent.”</p>\n<p>Frustrated local environmental groups protested over 100-strong when Secretary Zinke visited Santa Barbara in April.

fiscal year with a $1.4 million deficit, 49 vacant positions and over $6 million spent in overtime expenses.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County officials met this Tuesday to discuss a quarterly report of the county budget. Of the 68 departments, 65 are positive or at budget.</p>\n<p>The county executive office (CEO) and auditor-controller presented a report of the third quarter of the fiscal year at Tuesday’s board of supervisors meeting, revealing that the Sheriff’s Office is projected to reach a deficit of $1.4 million by the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Despite what might seem to be a daunting figure, the county is projected to end the fiscal year with a net increase of $750,000 in their general fund.</p>\n<p>SBSO’s deficit is an example of some of the fiscal challenges the county is facing this year. The county is expected to reach an approximate $35 million deficit if it continues to operate at this level of expenditure and has been re-balancing its budget for the next fiscal year to prevent funding issues.</p>\n<p>Following budget workshops with the county Board of Supervisors in April, the CEO is expected to release its proposed budget for the next fiscal year next Thursday. The Board of Supervisors will then hold its budget hearings on June 12, during which the public is welcome to comment on the final budget. If necessary, the hearings will continue on June 14 and 16.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate any potential budget issues, county officials have proposed 5 percent budget cuts across all departments.</p>\n<p>SBSO is facing a possible reduction of nine full-time positions in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), though Undersheriff Bernard Melekian has spoken to the board in favor of keeping the positions during last month’s budget workshop meetings.</p>\n<p>According to documents outlining the proposed cuts’ fiscal impact, reductions to the IVFP alone would bring approximately $1.9 million to the county’s general fund. These reductions would include removing three sergeants, two special duty deputies and four deputies, as well as reducing overtime pay.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, Isla Vista is the only station in the county that is not operating “at minimum staffing,” meaning there will likely be cuts in this area to balance the department’s finances.</p>\n<p>“As a result, we proposed a significant reduction in our staffing levels at the IVFP. We are in discussions with the CEO’s Office and University representatives, and at this point nothing has been decided as of yet,” Hoover said in an email.</p>\n<p>IVFP is not the only section of SBSO that would see cuts. The proposed cuts for SBSO in the next fiscal year total approximately $7.6 million.</p>\n<p>While these cuts were proposed at the budget workshops in April, none of the reductions have been finalized. They will go through public hearings before they are adopted.</p>\n<p>Each county department’s presentation during last month’s budget workshops included a section for departments to request a restoration or expansion of programs slated to be cut.</p>\n<p>In Melekian’s presentation, he said IVFP is a “critical” part of SBSO’s budget priorities but acknowledged that the department is facing issues when it comes to staffing, updating technology and funding.</p>\n<p>Melekian said the department’s equipment is outdated. The department is working on updating their computerized dispatch system as well as their jail management system — which will be operational in November — but he said the records management system remains out of date.</p>\n<p>According to Melekian, SBSO also needs new portable radios and car systems. The department does not proactively replace equipment but rather rushes to gather funding when old equipment fails to function.</p>\n<p>In addition to outdated technology, SBSO currently has 49 total vacancies in its stations, causing employees to work overtime. As a result, SBSO has had massive overtime expenses totaling $6.4 million for this fiscal year, offset partially by $5.4 million in salaries and benefits savings, according to a board letter from Tuesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the letter from the board of supervisors, “Further exacerbating the vacancy issue, an additional 17 patrol deputies and 12 custody deputies were on worker’s compensation leave, who not only continue to draw salary, but also create vacancies that are often covered with overtime.”</p>\n<p>The board anticipates that if the department ends the year with negative net financial impact, it will need to use the general fund to balance its deficit.</p>\n<p>“This assumption has already been factored into the projected year-end net positive variance of $750 thousand in the general fund,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The county will make their final decisions regarding the budget in June.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77957\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77957\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/","id":4406,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4405,4404,4403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Local Freebies and Activities This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week features free music in many forms, a yogi's Extravaganza pregame, a May 23 tragedy remembrance vigil and more.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>IT’S A PARTY</strong><br>\nA.S.

New fraternities are now dealing with the repercussions. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The last three closures paint an unfavorable portrait of Greek life at UCSB, but three new fraternities have sprouted up in Isla Vista with an emphasis on preventing sexual harassment, hazing and alcohol hospitalizations.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma attained charter status in Spring 2015, as did Sigma Chi in Jan. 2017. Phi Delta Theta received colony status in 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the three fraternities’ presidents, none have violated policies from the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Office of Student Life (OSL) or their national headquarters.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi president and third-year environmental science major Ryan Kelly said his organization has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault and hazing.</p>\n<p>“As sexual assault and stuff like that is very prominent today, you hear a lot about that, not only in general, but with Greek communities,” Kelly said. “So that’s something we definitely were aware of and wanted to change specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Kelly said his organization will kick brothers out of parties if the women attending feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>\n<p>“What it comes down to is how the girl sees it. If she feels uncomfortable; if she thinks something is happening … We really ultimately have to trust the girl’s word, because we don’t want that to be perceived as us making this acceptable,” Kelly said.</p>\n<p>Kelly said there would be consequences for brothers if this occurred, beginning with being removed from a party. In extreme circumstances, the brother could be removed from the fraternity and sent to the university to face additional punishment.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma president Adam Elomari and Phi Delta Theta president Christian Munson said their organizations have similar policies and do not tolerate sexual harassment or hazing in any way.</p>\n<p>Though several fraternities have aimed to improve safety policies, the Office of Student Life has issued IFC three warnings, three probations, one suspension and one closure for violation of OSL policies since 2015, according to an email from Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the OSL.</p>\n<p>These numbers do not include informal conversations about fraternities’ behavior between OSL and the fraternities’ officers.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said in the email multiple organizations have been charged with hazing since 2015, including campus organizations, fraternities, sororities and athletic teams. More than one organization is currently under investigation for hazing, he said in the email.</p>\n<p>According to the associate dean, the university’s current policies on hazing have changed but their central meaning has not.</p>\n<p>“Hazing simply should not be tolerated in any organization,” Ashlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Hazing is defined by OSL as any method of initiation likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm or “personal degradation or disgrace” that may lead to physical or mental harm.</p>\n<p>Hazing is currently considered a policy violation even if it does not actually cause harm. Any behavior that is likely to cause harm can qualify as hazing.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said his office is currently working with officers of several organizations to inform them of university policies.</p>\n<p>OSL currently requires fraternities to attend five workshops every year educating them on multiple subjects ranging from sexual violence, hazing, drug use, mental health and diversity awareness.</p>\n<p>Kelly said he has found these workshops useful, and his fraternity’s members gather to see how they can apply the workshops to their organization after they attend the meetings.</p>\n<p>Munson said the workshops do a good job of discussing the subjects, but he would prefer if they wore more interactive.</p>\n<p>“Maybe make it more interactive in a way so there’s not as many people who are not paying attention,” Munson said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/","id":4403,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4402,4401,4400],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Isla Vista’s Goings-On This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week's events include the 41st annual Isla Vista Jugglers Festival, Toga-Palooza and free vegan food.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday at the I.V.
