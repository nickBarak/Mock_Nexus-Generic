Their request to the county to use the Solar Lot on Embarcadero Del Mar as alternative parking was also rejected.</p>\n<p>CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said after identifying that the university was financially responsible for the fencing on El Colegio Road as opposed to the Santa Barbara County, the board put in a request with the university to avoid putting up fencing in response to the demands of the community.</p>\n<p>“We put in the request and essentially never heard back,” Brandt said. “A couple of us, myself included, feel very disillusioned by the fact that the university is not willing to listen to a bunch of concerned community members.”</p>\n<p>University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said fencing had been installed on El Colegio Road despite the motion that the CSD passed.</p>\n<p>“In the interest of public safety and traffic concerns, and in consultation with county officials and law enforcement, the decision was made to once again use the fencing during the weekend,” Estrada said when asked why the CSD’s request was denied.</p>\n<p>University Board appointee George Thurlow referenced two incidents in Santa Barbara in which pedestrians were killed in car accidents while jaywalking to explain why the university and UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) chief of police were adamant about installing the fences.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the discussion, it was concluded that that fence needed to be there, and if it saves one life, then it was worth it,” Thurlow said.</p>\n<p>The board had previously contacted the university to ask about the cost of fencing and were only told that it was a “substantial amount of money,” according to Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes the university is keeping the figure under wraps because the high price tag would upset residents who already oppose the fencing.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s disheartening because we do a lot of work to try to change the character of these events and make them so they are more community-based so that they are something that is safe for all community members,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said there are better alternatives the university could promote, such as UCIV, a student-run volunteer program that has been developed in the past three years.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes UCIV would be able to “ensure that the event is safe on a peer-to-peer level in a way that law enforcement has failed to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a volunteer program just spring up out of nowhere, totally student-led, that really wants to try to dull down the number of people that are interacting with law enforcement, that are being arrested and being cited,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt also spoke about the importance of peer-to-peer relationships between students and CSOs, saying he felt the motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station during Deltopia is a positive step.</p>\n<p>He said he believes it’s important for the CSOs to be the “eyes and ears” of the community during events like this, when residents might not feel comfortable approaching law enforcement personnel with critical information.</p>\n<p>Plans regarding the creation of alternative parking for residents living on Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road and Trigo Road were halted after the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department rejected the board’s request to use the Pardall Solar Parking Lot, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He also said the County was “concerned about the loss of revenue” if the parking lot was used by residents of impacted streets for free.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said the board was working with Transportation &amp; Parking Services in order to create alternative parking, particularly with concerns for students who use their cars to get to their jobs.</p>\n<p>Originally, it was assumed that only Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road would have restricted parking. Brandt then found out on April 4 that parking on Trigo Road would also be controlled and that parking would not be permitted within 100 feet of the barricades.</p>\n<p>“There’s certain areas where we put no parking, like Trigo Road. The vehicles there will get towed because that street is going to get shut down,” Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Lieutenant Juan Camarena said. “Everywhere else our recommendation is not to park, but if you park we’re not going to tow it like last year.”</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the city of Goleta, all vehicles in the area from Hollister Ave. to the southern city limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road without an approved permit will be subjected to a ticket. Parking lots on campus will also be restricted. Daytime parking will only be available for vehicles with the appropriate permits visible; vehicles parked on campus overnight without proper authorization will be impounded and given a $300 fine.</p>\n<p>Both Lieutenants Camarena and David Millard of UCPD attended the Deltopia town hall last month. At the town hall, Lieutenant Camarena said the UCPD and IVFP planned to closely monitor social media and adjust the amount of law enforcement present during Deltopia accordingly.</p>\n<p>Millard and Camarena said that they were not aware of any such monitoring when asked about efforts regarding plans to observe social media platforms for any posts related to Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say that I actually even heard that they were doing it this year,” Millard said.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP currently have no plans to adjust the projected level of police presence during Deltopia, regardless of the weather, according to IVFP Deputy James McKarrel.</p>\n<p>“Rain or shine we will be staffed because it’s easier for us to reduce our units if we don’t need them then to bring them in if we do need them,” McKarrel said.</p>\n<p>Camarena estimated that there may be “around 60 to 70 officers” out during Deltopia, but could not give an exact number.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be similar to last year,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p>Millard also could not give an exact number of officers and said the department won’t know how many they will deploy until the day of the event because “officers may get sick or have family emergencies.”</p>\n<p>Camarena also said IVFP would not bring in horses during Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year as a lieutenant for Deltopia, and the whole thing for me is just another day for us,” he said. “We just need to make sure that people are safe.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An 18-year-old Isla Vista resident was arrested in Estero Park Monday night for “obstructing a peace officer,” according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies observed several people arguing in Estero Park at approximately 7:45 p.m. on Monday and attempted to detain the group, concerned that the argument “could turn into a fight,” SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officers detained Marco Antonio Mendoza after he “attempted to incite” the group to avoid arrest, Hoover said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza initially walked away while deputies attempted to detain the other individuals. Deputies then “observed that [Mendoza] had a knife in his back pocket,” Hoover said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hoover, Mendoza was “argumentative and uncooperative.” He returned to the group and “despite orders that he was being detained, he ignored deputies and attempted to incite the other subjects to walk away and leave,” Hoover said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza “delayed the investigation,” which resulted in additional police units arriving on the scene to safely detain the subjects, Hoover said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was booked at the Santa Barbara Jail at approximately 9:56 p.m. on a $2,500 bail, according to arrest logs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no student by the name of Marco Mendoza in UC Santa Barbara’s student directory.</span></p>\n<p>Mendoza is not currently a student at Santa Barbara City College and has never registered for classes there, according to SBCC spokesperson Luz Reyes-Martin.</p>\n<p><i>Updated at 9:02 a.m.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Currently, the machine is the only bitcoin ATM in Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss co-founded the bitcoin ATM company Coind LLC with a hometown friend. They funded the startup costs themselves, confident that the ATMs would provide a steady cash flow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has proven noticeable. I.V. Deli Mart customers frequently stop to examine it, mostly out of curiosity, said Deli Mart owner Michael Hassan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people come in and look at it and say, ‘Oh look, bitcoin!’” Hassan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not too many I.V. residents have actually bought in. Blaufuss estimated the machine gets about two to three purchases a day — each worth about $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its invention in 2009, bitcoin’s popularity has steadily climbed through internet word-of-mouth. Its major selling point is that transactions are encrypted and decentralized, which means it can’t be easily stolen and central banks can’t track the exchanges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATMs provide another platform for people to obtain the currency, complementing online exchanges like Coinbase. The ATM in I.V. allows only purchases; withdrawals must be carried out online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is valued at more than $7,000 per coin as of Saturday, but the amount is strikingly volatile and can sharply rise or decline from day to day. The currency is so speculative that even a single piece of bad news can lead to bitcoin owners dumping and ditching their share of the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just the past four months, the value has plummeted from a </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-warnings-grow-louder-idUSKBN1E919T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record high</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of nearly $18,000, after news broke that foreign governments are attempting to </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/bitcoin-drops-more-than-14-percent-to-below-7000.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add regulations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cryptocurrency transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Blaufuss has sold all of his bitcoins, though he noted that the value may rebound just as quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The market right now is just trash,” he said. “Everything is in the gutter. I’ve sold everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But it’s a good time to buy right now, because everything is so cheap,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ATMs have picked up steam after a slow start, said James Forshaw, Blaufuss’ friend and company co-founder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“College students are a lot more aware of bitcoin and how to use it,” Forshaw said. He and Blaufuss have set up another ATM in Agoura Hills and plan to place one in Oxnard in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATM customers don’t have to buy one whole coin every time — since the currency is digital, it can be broken down into fractional amounts that run as many as eight decimal places.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters laud the currency as a future competition to the dollar, given how little encryption and how much oversight currently exists for dollar transactions. But critics have dismissed the currency, calling its popularity a </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/bitcoin-bubble/547952/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get-rich-quick bubble</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and comparing it unfavorably with more stable cryptocurrencies like ethereum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss noted in a Facebook post earlier this month that his company would consider adding ethereum to the ATM’s selections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The enthusiasm behind cryptocurrency is buoyed by a faith that society will one day value encrypted transactions as a serious alternative to trading legal tender.

His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V. CSD Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident received considerable local media coverage and Gelb faced widespread community backlash. Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed. He has not been present at any of the hearings. In February, his representation unsuccessfully filed to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Facebook group titled “Texts From Gelb,” I.V. residents share videos of Gelb’s public outbursts and screenshots of profane texts he had sent them. On Saturday, a user posted a video of Gelb using misogynistic slurs to tell residents not to sit on the roof of their complex. He also refers to the apparent sale of his properties, which he had been </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t need these fucking cunts falling off my roof, ruining my sale,” he says at one point in the video. “Tell that fucking whore to get off my goddamn roof!” he shouts at another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb declined the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s request for comment on the video.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he was frustrated the process has taken so long, but he won’t be deterred from seeing it through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ll continue to show up to these hearings for as long as I need to,” Bertrand told the

The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has been selling raspados, mangonadas and other treats in Isla Vista and UCSB for the past three years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the campaign’s creation in February, $490 out of the $85,000 goal has been raised. The $85,000 primary goal is to cover the cost of a “professional” food cart as well as permits and insurance Camacho needs to sell on campus, according to the campaign’s </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/HijinoEloteroman\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M.U.J.E.R. co-chair and third-year sociology major Dulce Gonzalez</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created the campaign in hopes of gathering financial and community support for Camacho’s return to campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was first posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook, and organizers have been tagging larger news outlets like Univision and Mitù in hopes to gain support beyond the UCSB community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to collaborate with him because he’s not only trying to get back on campus to fundraise and help student orgs out with their fundraising, but we also want to try to expand his business,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho hopes to raise enough funds to help him purchase a food truck from a vendor in Los Angeles that would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Sep. 2017, the Office of Student Life and the office for Environmental Health and Safety have implemented regulations that require vendors like Camacho to obtain either a Temporary Food Service permit, which has a fee of approximately $180, or a Mobile Food Facility permit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general liability insurance that covers up to approximately $2 million in coverage is also required. The yearly payment for general liability insurance for a food cart vendor can range from $500 to $1000 a year, according to Brashears Insurance. For a food truck, the yearly payment can cost between $5,000 to $7,500 a year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has since held fundraisers in Isla Vista but has experienced issues with the county food inspectors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been asked to remove his stand by inspectors due to the proximity of a public restroom from his food booth, although he does have the necessary permits to sell in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes that a food truck would allow him to comfortably sell both on campus and in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unos de mi mayores gustos es trabajar con los estudiantes.

Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’Oyo’ Park, Children’s Park and Estero Park are among other proposed locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould explained that electrical boxes have already been installed in the ground at People’s Park by Embarcadero Hall and I.V. Clinic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground trenches to power two electrical panels have also been constructed that run from two cement access points in the ground.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gould, the electrical panels are scheduled to be installed in April and will allow bands to come and perform at People’s Park without needing to bring in a generator for power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The electrical lines installed will also help bring light to Perfect Park, which is located next to People’s Park, Gould added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding for these new improvements will be coming from Measure O that was on the ballot last May for I.V. voters for the 2017 Santa Barbara County Elections. Lebell said the measure was a response to the expiration of a “consolidated bond” established in 1999 that taxed each bedroom in I.V. an extra $28 a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bond was paid off, instead of allowing this tax to expire, the IVRPD held a special election in June of 2017 that proposed keeping the tax at the same rate for an additional 10 years, but this time to have the money go toward park improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure O gives the IVRPD about $250,000 a year to apply towards park enhancements, Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD is also hoping to install new lighting on the basketball courts at Estero Park, located off of Camino Del Sur. This would “allow community members to play after sunset,” IVRDP Chairman Jacob Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell said the new lighting proposals are “a response to the community’s desire for improvements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the years, improved lighting has consistently ranked among Isla Vistan’s infrastructural issues that they would most like to see addressed and improved,” Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time, no concrete decisions have been made for expanding lighting, other than what has already been installed in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82051\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

id=\"caption-attachment-81844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lieutenant David Millard from UCPD said he anticipates about a 20 percent decrease in UCPD law enforcement, “depending on what the weekend is looking like.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Juan Camarena from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) added that the amount of IVFP officers will most likely be similar in numbers to last year; however, they do not plan to bring horses to the event.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP plan to closely monitor social media to see if anything is posted about Deltopia weekend plans. What they see could determine the amount of law enforcement they deploy, according to Camarena.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) held a town hall to discuss police presence, parking restrictions, fencing, public concerns and the ideal Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Camarena and Millard also guaranteed that undocumented students will be safe from detainment due to immigration status, and they explained instances in which students will have to present identification to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“We come into contact with people that violate the law, we don’t care about their legal status,” Camarena said. “As long as they provide some type of ID that’s not fake.”</p>\n<p>To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Students at the town hall also expressed concerns regarding the amount of fencing put up the weekend of Deltopia, especially the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>Jacob Lebell, an Isla Vista resident, said the fences were “insulting,” “unnecessary” and “intolerable.”</p>\n<p>In response to these complaints, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to direct staff to request that no fencing be installed on El Colegio Road during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Camarena revealed that barricades will be placed on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road during the weekend and said any cars that leave that area during the weekend will not be allowed to re-enter due to concerns of cars being vandalized.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and the Isla Vista Tenants Union will be advertising for students not to park in those areas by going door-to-door, according to EVPLA Batsheva Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>If cars are parked on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road, they will not be towed, Camarena said.</p>\n<p>The CSD unanimously passed a third motion to direct staff to find alternative parking for residents. Director Spencer Brandt suggested that the parking lot of the Community Center be used as alternative parking for residents during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>A noise ordinance in Isla Vista will be in effect from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. throughout the weekend of Deltopia, according to Gina Fischer, representative for Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>The CSD released an online survey to ask UCSB students about their plans for Deltopia and their opinions on police presence.</p>\n<p>Results from 335 responses revealed that the majority of students were unsatisfied with law enforcement presence during Deltopia last year; however, most students still said they felt safe throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>The survey also revealed that 64 percent of responders discourage their friends from visiting I.V. during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>The CSD emphasized that in order for an ideal Deltopia to become a reality, there must be a balance between the students’ desires and the community’s desires in regard to police presence.</p>\n<p>Last year, the university spent an estimated <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">$30,000 to $40,000</a> on advertisements urging visitors to stay away from Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>This year, the university expects to spend less on Deltopia ads — specifically, in the $20,000–$30,000 range, according to Andrea Estrada, UCSB director of news and media relations. A final figure will not be determined until after Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD Board convened on Feb. 22 to address comments and concerns from the staff about said dog park and to finalize a location, according to the IVRPD Special Meeting Agenda. The project is proposed to begin in Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Board member Pegeen Soutar, the original proposed location for the park was Anisq’Oyo’ Park, next to I.V. Drip. However there were concerns that the presence of dogs could potentially disrupt the park’s pond and the birds that reside there. Because of this, they decided to move the park to Seuno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar, who was accompanied by her own dog, Honeybear, revealed that both she and Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the IVRPD board, are leading the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell referred to the park on Sueno as a “fairly nice park, but very underutilized.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the park consists of a big grass field with a children’s play structure and a couple of picnic tables. The IVRPD is currently considering the possibility of transferring the play structure to Children’s Park once the dog park is established, Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations to the park will be made, including surrounding the perimeter with a fence and possibly a “double-gate” to make it easy for dogs to get in and out. Lebell also expressed the IVRPD’s desire to eventually expand the area out in front of the park to include “more and nicer picnic tables.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to convert one of the parks to a dog park was proposed by Lebell after he took notice of the increased amount of dogs in Isla Vista since students have begun to be allowed to have emotional support animals. He also realized that a number of I.V. residences do not have yards that are equipped for dogs to run in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD has also discussed the possibility of including a drinking fountain for the dogs and structures like a hollowed log for the dogs to play on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell’s vision of the park would eventually include a reduced cost or free dog training classes there in an attempt to create a place where “there could be a more centrally located place for dog information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board will be reaching out to the houses in the neighboring vicinity once the project is underway to let them know the changes that will be occuring. The park would have a curfew, like most dog parks, to ensure that people and their dogs do not utilize it past daytime hours. However, a specific time has not yet been decided on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board currently does not have a definitive timeline for the finalized project. Lebell said the plan may be minorly delayed, depending on how impacted local construction companies are by the recent fires and flooding in the Montecito area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lebell, the park’s main purpose would be to create a place where dog owners could organize together and let their dogs run around freely and socialize.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/","id":4329,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[4328,4327,4326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Illes was taken to the hospital after the attack, where she underwent surgery and eight blood transfusions. Cyrus Rocky McClain was arrested for the assault. <em>Alex Gorman / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lauren Illes, 24, lost nearly half of her blood and needed eight blood transfusions to survive the incident, she said. She is now on the way to a full recovery.</p>\n<p>Police arrested Cyrus Rocky McClain, 19, on Saturday. McClain was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and infliction of bodily harm while committing a felony. He is being held in Santa Barbara County Jail on a $500,000 bail.</p>\n<p>McClain was a part-time Santa Barbara City College student in the fall, but he was no longer enrolled at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p>Illes spoke to the <em>Nexus </em>about fighting off her attacker and nearly dying from her injuries. She offered both praise and criticism of law enforcement’s response, taking issue with a Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press release that referred to her injuries as “not life threatening.”</p>\n<p>SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover clarified that Illes’s injuries were not life threatening at the time of the suspect’s arrest. Hoover, who wrote the release, said she was not trying to trivialize Illes’s injuries, but rather assure the community that Illes was no longer at risk of dying. Still, multiple news outlets erroneously reported that the stab wound itself did not endanger Illes’s life.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, Illes stood with her boyfriend on the driveway of her Del Playa Drive home, watching police break up a party across the street. Illes, a third-year environmental studies major, transferred to UCSB in the fall.</p>\n<p>She saw groups of friends pass by until she noticed a man, dressed in all black, walking around in circles by himself. She had never seen him before, she told the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>“He was looking into my house, and he had gone past my driveway into the back part of my patio, so he had crossed into my property,” Illes said.</p>\n<p>Her boyfriend pressured the unknown man to leave, and he eventually complied, she said.</p>\n<p>All was calm for about 15 minutes. Then, out of nowhere, the man jumped on her and began pounding her with his fists, she said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know that I had been stabbed, and so I was actually trying to fight back,” she said. “I was punching him and chasing him. And then I got really, really light-headed.”</p>\n<p>“I looked down and there was just so much blood all over me, and it just kind of kept pouring out. I was really confused because I didn’t know what happened, and then I just kind of collapsed over there in my driveway.”</p>\n<p>While Illes lay in the driveway, her boyfriend began chasing her assailant, she said. During the chase, he started shouting at officers to attend to Illes. Before that moment, the officers across the street had been busy detaining a partygoer, Hoover told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>After law enforcement responded, Illes was transported to the hospital. By the time she arrived, she had lost nearly half of her blood, and her bladder was plainly visible. The knife had also severed her iliac vein, which drains blood from the pelvis.</p>\n<p>Surgeons operated on Illes for over three hours. She received eight blood transfusions and nearly lost her life during the surgery, she said. When she woke up in a hospital bed with 11 staples in her body, she felt a lot of things — but mostly lucky to be alive.</p>\n<p>“I felt extreme gratitude,” she said. “The hospital and the care that I’ve gotten is really amazing.” She was especially grateful for one of the responding cops, whom she said was trained in dealing with on-site trauma injuries.</p>\n<p>Within 24 hours, law enforcement had arrested a suspect for the crime.</p>\n<p>McClain was arrested and booked into the county jail after law enforcement brought him in for questioning. Illes said she and her boyfriend both identified McClain in a photo line-up, not knowing police had already arrested him.</p>\n<p>Illes praised law enforcement for the quick turnaround, saying she was “grateful they spent the whole night trying to find the guy.”</p>\n<p>But in an anonymous <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/8052yw/stabbing_ucsb_student_update/\">Reddit post</a> on Saturday, Illes’s boyfriend criticized the police’s initial response.</p>\n<p>“I chased the attacker away right passed [sic] them yelling and they absolutely did nothing,” he wrote. “Additionally, only one police officer on the scene was trained in trauma injuries. This is disturbing given their perceived preparedness in situations like this only a couple years after the shooting.”</p>\n<p>“They watched the attacker run away as I’m screaming the situation at them – he could have been easily caught,” he added. Illes’s boyfriend, who wished to remain anonymous, verified his identity to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Hoover, speaking for the SBSO, refuted his statements.</p>\n<p>“Any inference that the deputies didn’t react quickly is simply not the case,” she said. “In fact, deputies acted immediately when they learned that a stabbing had occurred, and they worked along with detectives throughout the night to locate and arrest the individual. They immediately cared for the victim and their actions are what helped save her.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another thing stuck out to Illes. On Friday night, as she slouched onto a telephone pole, dozens of people walked by her and did nothing to help, she said. Some passersby even took photos of her.</p>\n<p>“The world doesn’t make a whole lot of sense anymore,” she said. “I would just like people to try and regain a little bit of their humanity because the fact that I had to lie there, thinking that I was dying, and having people go, ‘Oh my god, look at this!’ and take pictures — that was so disgusting to me. That bothers me almost more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Illes will take time off from UCSB as she recovers from her injuries. Barring infection or damaged tendons, she is on the path to a full recovery. But she still has no explanation for why she was attacked and firmly denies knowing the suspect before the assault.</p>\n<p>“There’s something that you can expect and you see coming, but this just seems so wildly unprovoked, so out of nowhere,” she said. “There’s no way to really explain it, other than [that] it’s just really sad.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story said Illes slouched onto a telephone pole “with a knife inside her body.” There is not yet evidence to indicate the knife was still in her body. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg.

administrators agreed to during the sit-in. The demand states that the university will work with the CSD to document the number of sexual assault incidents in Isla Vista, as well as the number of events centered on sexual assault education.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand suggested a three-pronged approach that includes using cumulative sexual assault incident statistics from 2016 and 2017, a list of sexual assault services and service providers and an overview of developing programs and ongoing efforts toward combating sexual assault.</p>\n<p>This plan, while deviating from the plan originally suggested by UCSB alumna Ro’Shawndra Earvin during the May 2017 sit-in, still focuses on the “end-all, be-all” goal of the sexual assault report card, but starts instead with a framing of the climate in Isla Vista, CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“We need to have an agreement on what the numbers are before we can go anywhere with the problem, because the I.V. CSD is not going to solve sexual assault in Isla Vista tomorrow,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While the report card’s completion does not have a set deadline, Brandt said the biweekly meetings will allow community directors to work on the project.</p>\n<p>“It will definitely be made very public once it’s done. I think that we’re still in our preliminary conversations about that, but it looks like it’s one of our staff’s top priorities right now,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Brandt called the action taken on the sexual assault report card as a “starting point” toward solving the issue of sexual assault in I.V.</p>\n<p>The next steps in addressing this issue involve expansion of the UCSB Community Service Organization Safety Stations, he said.</p>\n<p>“The community trusts [CSOs] more than they trust the police when it comes [to] sharing information, and I think that expanding that would be a good piece of the puzzle that we can play,” Brandt said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
