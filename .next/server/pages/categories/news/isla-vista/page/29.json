The incident sparked onlookers to begin throwing rocks and bottles at deputies who came to provide reinforcement and ultimately degenerated into a full scale riot between revelers and police, ending with police shutting down DP and firing on crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year financial math and statistics and French double major Sophie Talbot said she had just woken up from a nap when the Deltopia riots broke out and stayed inside her house on the 6500 block of DP while she watched the violence unfold.</p>\n<p>“[Edwards] should be treated as a criminal that assaulted a police officer and also as someone who ruined a community as a whole,” Talbot said in an email. “Not only did people get hurt, but it also completely screwed up a place we call home.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair and second-year art major Roberto Pérez said Edwards acted ignorantly when he assaulted Magaña.</p>\n<p>“[With] scarring an officer over something as stupid as getting away with his alcohol, he better expect repercussions for his actions,” Pérez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds. – Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair Roberto Pérez</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Talbot, law enforcement had difficulty controlling the riots because no one could have foreseen the violence that occurred that night.</p>\n<p>“The police and I.V. could have been as prepared as they could have been,” Talbot said in an email. “Never would they have expected someone smashing a bottle on a police officer’s head.”</p>\n<p>Pérez said it is difficult to determine if the riots could have been prevented if Edwards had not assaulted Magaña because of the ambiguity that occurs with large crowds and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s hard to say,” Pérez said in an email. “There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes the events that unfolded in April are not repeated in the future.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to see students be punished, but at the same time I don’t like to see officers be assaulted,” Schunk said. “What I really hope for is in the future we don’t see events like this occurring as often.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he thinks Isla Vista’s adaptive nature will help prevent Deltopia from being as violent as it was last spring.</p>\n<p>“I don’t foresee anything like this occurring again,” Schunk said. “I think that this year there is a collective feeling that we have to kind of change the culture of Deltopia and make it something that won’t bubble over to what it has become.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/","id":4778,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4777,4776,4775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Planned March To Protest Abrego Evictions","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V.

IVTU held a meeting earlier this week, seen here, about the situation. <i>Daily Nexus File Photo</i></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V. Friday at 1 p.m. to protest the eviction of six households from their apartments at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The march is part of IVTU’s three-day “Tenants Re-Claiming Isla Vista” <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/\">campaign</a> created to amass support for evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas whose renovated units underwent an alleged 50 percent rent increase. The campaign aims to urge Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the management company working for Abrego Villas’ property owners, to pay the tenants’ relocation benefits, required under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said the march has been organized to promote justice for the evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas and to inspire further legislative action to prevent future unjustified evictions in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are requesting that Majestic Asset Management pay the tenants the relocation benefits that they rightly deserve but have not yet received,” Bogdanov said. “We would like to show to the legislatures on the county and statewide levels that Isla Vista is in need of legislative reforms and improvements to strengthen tenant variety as well as to improve the housing situation in I.V.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities. – IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bogdanov said the march is also intended to educate and unite all tenants renting spaces in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Lack of knowledge on the part of the tenants about their rights in housing issues is a big problem in Isla Vista and … affects all members of the community,” Bogdanov said. “The only way we can create a real difference is by becoming more educated and uniting to demand better housing.”</p>\n<p>California Assemblymember for Santa Barbara Das Williams said he supports the IVTU’s campaign and that without their action there would be little knowledge of the issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think that if they weren’t doing something that we might not even know about it,” Williams said. “I hope they will continue to engage the owners in a respectful and civil manner as something that might actually provide some benefits for the families that were involved.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said this is not a one-time issue but rather the latest in a series of evictions of low-income residents, primarily Latino families, in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to rally the community support and raise awareness about the fact that these housing issues are recurring, and ongoing” Bogdanov said. “We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities.”</p>\n<p>President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak said the property owner of Abrego Villas is responsible for the evictions that violated Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, not Majestic Asset Management, LLC.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenants in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts. – President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic Asset Management, LLC plans to present an argument in defense of the company in court.</p>\n<p>“We intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said, “We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes Majestic Asset Management, LLC should pay the tenants the relocation benefits he thinks they deserve.</p>\n<p>“In my mind either they should comply because they are required to do so, or because it is the right thing to do. Either way it was the intent of the county ordinance to cover situations like this,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said evictions such as these can be a result of maximization of rent returns by all I.V. landlords, which can create discrimination problems in I.V. against low-income residents.</p>\n<p>“The diversity of having families a part of Isla Vista is something that can mitigate some of the public safety concerns,” Williams said. “The most interesting, the most safe, and the most thriving neighborhoods are ones that have demographic diversity, and one of the challenges we have in Isla Vista is increasing demographic concentration.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/","id":4782,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4781,4780,4779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU Holds Campaign For Evicted I.V.

According to former tenant Maria Hernandez, she was not notified of the eviction until two days before the deadline. <em>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) hosted a housing forum titled “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” at the Pardall Center in I.V. yesterday in order to gather attention and support for households evicted from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The forum was the first event in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/\">a three-day campaign</a> to fight for relocation benefits of six long-term, low income residents who were evicted without justification from their apartments at Abrego Villas on Abrego Rd. in late August 2014. The forum included a presentation from IVTU representatives and a Q&amp;A session with the evicted tenants.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, if five or more residencies are evicted from a property within 90 days, the management company is required to provide financial support in the form of “relocation benefits.”</p>\n<p>Following their evictions, the apartments were allegedly renovated and the rent price increased by 50 percent. The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and IVTU sponsored lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to Majestic, the property managers refused to grant them benefits and the tenants then challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors. In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day. – IVTU adviser and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>Subsequent evictions have taken place over 90 days after the initial six evictions, which IVTU believe is part of an effort to avoid further requests for relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>Brian Lezak of Majestic Asset Management, LLC said the company is not directly responsible for the evictions, and that the property owner did not break any rules.</p>\n<p>“Majestic Asset Management, Inc. is not the owner of Abrego Villas, only the management company,” Lezak said. “The ownership complied with the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and therefore did not violate any laws.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said the facts have not been plainly presented, and that Majestic is prepared to defend the owner of Abrego Villas.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said. “We will defend their position in court, which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said Majestic supports IVTU’s purpose, but maintains the company did not violate any regulations.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenant’s in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<p>IVTU advisor and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the event represents an “opportunity for truly engaged community dialogue” on issues relevant to students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors,” said Jones. “In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, while there are laws in place to protect renters, the law does not require property owners to provide any justification for evictions.</p>\n<p>“The laws do not protect folks from just being evicted,” said Jones. “The property owners have a right, if you will, to evict without any just cause.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major and IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov said issues affecting some I.V. residents should be minded by every student who lives in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We believe that fair housing opportunities are for all, and all residents of Isla Vista should unite together to fight for this,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60267\" style=\"width: 610px\"

case will go to small claims court, where the tenants will ask that a superior court judge hear the case in order to bring more attention to their allegedly unjustified evictions.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista Tenants Union has sponsored and proved the tenants with a very qualified lawyer who has decided to take on their case,” Bogdanov said. “They have not broken any clauses in their lease in order to be served that eviction notice.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said in a series of <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">2013 evictions from 781 Embaradero Del Norte</a>, the tenants were served eviction documents in English, which they were then pressured to sign, despite some tenants’ inability to understand English.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tenants were tricked into waiving their rights,” Bogdanov said. “Some of the tenants were only Spanish speaking and some of the landlords tricked them into signing waivers of their rights which were in English.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said the tenants most recently evicted in October were not offered any justification for their evictions.</p>\n<p>“The tenants were originally very confused, because when they were served eviction notices, the eviction notices did not provide the explanation.”</p>\n<p>Maria Hernandez, a long-term resident and single mother, said she lived in the Abrego Villas for 11 years before receiving her eviction notice. According to Hernandez, she did not receive word of the eviction until two days before the deadline for them to leave.</p>\n<p>“I came to the United States for a better future,” Hernandez said, “We are paying our rent, we are working … I don’t know why we are being discriminated against.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she did not have time to find adequate housing after finding out about the eviction.</p>\n<p>“I went to sleep in a church,” Hernandez said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60229\" style=\"width: 462px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60229\" data-attachment-id=\"60229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/tenants_anna-kodelashvili-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=2464%2C1632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2464,1632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"18\",\"credit\":\"Picasa\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422470726\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=452%2C300\" alt=\"Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus\" width=\"452\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=2464&amp;ssl=1 2464w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Upon eviction, owners told Hernandez she would receive her security deposit if the apartment was clean and if she cooperated with the eviction request, but wound up being denied a portion of the deposit, she said.</p>\n<p>“We left everything clean and they still took money from the deposit,” Hernandez said. “They gave back 70 or 75 dollars.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez had also lived at the Abrego Villas for 11 years before her eviction and said her daughter was pregnant at the time of the eviction.

Clinic building, where I.V. residents, students and administrators <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/\">continued a discussion</a> that has been taking place over the last several months regarding the establishment of self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Demographics, parking issues, legislative challenges and uncertainty surrounding I.V.’s exact population were among the issues discussed during Tuesday’s forum. The meeting is one in a series that Williams will host, with the next town hall meeting to continue the I.V. self-governance discussion scheduled for Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said there are difficulties involved with researching I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“I think there are going to be hidden populations that are difficult to count,” Thurlow said. “There very well could be hangers on, which are people who have gone to school here and they’re just kind of off the radar and they’re just hanging out here.”</p>\n<p>According to Thurlow, some I.V. residents live in garages and split bedrooms, a situation not accounted for in typical census counting.</p>\n<p>“There’s the situation that one of my students explained,” Thurlow said. “She lives in three-bedroom house with two people living in the garage and two people living in each bedroom. And that’s not showing up in the census data.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista. – I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thurow said one suggestion is to use student researchers to calculate I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking to [UCSB sociology professor] Victor Rios about having his spring class do a door-to-door survey in Isla Vista just to get a demographic number,” Thurow said. “Right now what we’re trying to do is use students to figure out as close as possible how many people really live in Isla Vista and who they are.”</p>\n<p>I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned with the impacted parking situation in I.V and how the Campus 880 Apartments have contributed to the issue.</p>\n<p>“Now some of the property owners, even though they’re now being required to provide parking for their housing that they’re building, they’re charging for it,” Soutar said. “And so what we found when 880 went up, because you just threw three or four hundred people in, all of a sudden all those cars showed up to fill our little park parking lot and the entire neighborhood around there got even more impacted and the parking lot is sitting only partially full.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said paid permits for parking on the street in I.V. was previously suggested to solve the congested parking but was denied by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency that regulates and protects beach access to the public.</p>\n<p>“Years ago we tried it and it was going to be Isla Vista-wide and the thought was maybe it would be 50 dollars a year to help facilitate and run the program so we wouldn’t have to go after a grant or anything like that,” Soutar said. “The problem that happened with that parking plan was the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the Coastal Commission had concerns that parking permits would prohibit public access to the beach.</p>\n<p>“The Coastal Commission was like, ‘Hey if you need a permit to park in Isla Vista how are you gonna access the beach,” Souter said.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the parking problem needs to be addressed so that residents can find safe parking places near their homes.</p>\n<p>“Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista,” Soutar said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets. – Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz</p></blockquote>\n<p>Local business owner Jay Freeman said the high cost of parking permits on campus can also be problematic because it causes first-year students to park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As far as UCSB is concerned, freshman don’t really have cars because they have a process for buying permits to store cars as freshman,” Freeman said, “When you look at the permit numbers for that, virtually no one is using that process. Instead, if they’re bringing cars, they must be putting them somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz said she agrees that many students avoid parking fees by leaving their car on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly what my friends would do while they were living in FT,” De la Cruz said. “It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said students should be included in the planning process to address I.V. parking.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to see programs that offered scholarships or prizes to people who develop the best new traffic system in Isla Vista, including parking, including bike lanes,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“At that point you get five or six different proposals in front of you and as a community we can see what we really like . . . it provides an opportunity for students involved.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a representative from Williams’ office, said concrete plans must be added to AB-3, the I.V. self-governance bill proposed by Williams in the California State Assembly, which needs to be amended to include definite plans for a local government.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely have to amend the bill by mid-March in order to keep it alive or else it just goes away because now the language that’s in there can’t even be assigned to a committee,” Elliott said. “The legislature couldn’t even vote on it right now because it would do nothing . . . We could park it in a committee for however long we need.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/","id":4780,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4779,4778,4777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVFP To Begin Citing Cars On Sidewalks","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last week, Isla Vista Foot Patrol announced a policy stating all cars in Isla Vista that are parked on or blocking a sidewalk, even in front of residents’ driveways, will be cited for traffic violat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60145\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60145\" data-attachment-id=\"60145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/sidewalks-dp_stephen-manga-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422246789\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sidewalks-DP\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=650%2C433\" alt=\"Vehicles parked in a manner that is on or blocking sidewalks will soon be cited by Isla Vista Foot Patrol.

According to IVFP officials, deputies began notifying I.V. residents and property managers in November to make residents aware of the rule change come Feb. 15. The purpose of the new citations, according to the policy, will be to increase pedestrian visibility on the sidewalks and therefore increase their safety by keeping them out of the street.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the high population density in I.V. causes residents to park illegally on sidewalks to make room for more cars.</p>\n<p>“Rising costs make people want more roommates, which means more cars,” Plastino said. “They’re trying to slam more cars into a driveway that wasn’t designed that way.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties. If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk? – First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, the practice of parking on the sidewalk forces pedestrians out into the street and into the path of oncoming traffic. Citations will also be issued to allow pedestrians with physical limitations safe use of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Sam Perez said he has not ever seen law enforcement officers try to keep people out of the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen I.V. Foot Patrol, or any law enforcement for that matter, make an effort to keep students out of the street here,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the law wasn’t enforced in the past because I.V. lacked a complete sidewalk network.</p>\n<p>“You go over to Goleta and you’re not going to see a whole bunch of people just standing in the middle of the road, because they have sidewalks there,” Plastino said. “So the thought was: If you’re a pedestrian and you’re walking down DP, you need to be on the sidewalk; you can’t be in the roadway.”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph said the enforcement does not make sense because parties tend to keep people off sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties,” Joseph said, “If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear. – IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plastino said California law states that cars cannot park in a way that blocks sidewalks and that now that DP has a sidewalk running its full length, IVFP can enforce the law correctly.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people start realizing that the sidewalks are there now, and sidewalks can be utilized for pedestrian use,” Plastino said. “If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major Adam Chukhman said it would be hard to keep everyone off the street even with the new restrictions because people simply don’t want to walk on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“The reason people walk on the street isn’t the lack of good sidewalks,” Chukhman said, “it’s the lack of want to walk on the sidewalk.”</p>\n<p>First-year chemical engineering major, John Stair said the he does not think citations would keep people from walking in the street.</p>\n<p>“It’s clear that they want people to stay off the street and stay on the sidewalk, but that’s just never going to happen,” Stair said.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, I.V. will need more funding to be able to complete sidewalk installation along El Nido, Trigo, Seville and Madrid roads, as well as the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The victim sustained knife injuries to the chest and head and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for treatment, where he is currently stable. Following the incident, Ruiz was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony subject to up to four years in state prison and a maximum $10,000 fine, and bail has been set at $30,000.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega president and third-year psychology and economics major Jason Ouyang said Ruiz was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a “female accomplice,” both of whom approached the fraternity and demanded entry to a private gathering at the house.</p>\n<p>“We were having a small get-together, ourselves and our friends, and this person was not allowed entry into our house,” Ouyang said. “The guy was very aggressive and probably under the influence of alcohol … my brothers wouldn’t let him come in and he took that very personally and he tried to start a fight … he pulled out some sort of weapon and gave him a couple lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Sheriff’s Office officials denied requests for additional information on the incident.</p>\n<p>Ouyang said the incident was unprecedented and the fraternity never has issues keeping people from coming into private gatherings.</p>\n<p>“In this situation I guess that person wasn’t gonna take no for an answer,” Ouyang said. “Usually there’s never problems like this; this is the very first time something to this has occurred — its a little traumatizing.”</p>\n<p>According to Ouyang, the fraternity would gather in the next few days to assess the situation and focus on the group.</p>\n<p>“We’re all just kinda shaken by it but at the same time we can’t let that deter us,” Ouyang said.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega is a multicultural social fraternity and part of the Multicultural Greek Council on campus.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is requesting that anyone with information contact Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigators at (805) 683-2724, or in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office, located at 6504 Trigo Road.

visitors, who flock to Isla Vista by the thousands annually for Deltopia (above), from parking in local communities. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Goleta City Council decided to consider a plan on Tuesday to use parking permits to discourage out-of-town visitors from flooding Isla Vista during Deltopia this April, a method used in October to limit crowds during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Under the plan, parking permits for certain areas of the City of Goleta will be issued by mail and posted in the windows of residents’ cars during the weekend of Deltopia, taking place this year on April 4. The annual event typically attracts thousands of out-of-town visitors, whose presence creates parking issues for portions of the city over the weekend. The parking permits would be issued for neighborhoods south of Hollister Avenue between Cannon Green Drive and Storke Road to the city limits, the same area issued parking permits for Halloween.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Goleta City Council saw the damage and destruction caused by Deltopia last spring and is aiming to put preventative measures in place to keep I.V. safe.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how inconvenienced we or the residents of Isla Vista are, it all boils down to if everyone got home safe,” Plastino said. “That’s my number one concern is that you guys are safe.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said one of Goleta’s concern about Deltopia is the number of attendees expected to show up and how the city will protect its residents from the influx.</p>\n<p>“As a city, they are definitely concerned with an influx of outsiders flooding the city streets and potentially parking in front of people’s houses and now the people that live in those houses don’t have parking spaces,” Plastino said. “They’re looking at it as a city that needs to protect its residents, and it’s a good idea for them to do that because it would help us keep the outsiders to a minimum during Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the parking permits would help deter outsiders from the event if available parking is minimal, and a decrease in visitors could mean less injuries and damage to I.V. and its residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concern of mine because my job is to make sure the public of Isla Vista is safe, and that means anyone in Isla Vista, whether that is outsiders or locals,” Plastino said. “I have to make sure that the property of residents remains as safe as possible too.”</p>\n<p>According to Goleta City Council Public Information Officer Valerie Kushnerov, an issue with permitting over Halloween was lack of adequate permits available per resident. Kushnerov said permits would be mailed out to an entire apartment complex rather than each unit, which left multiple residents without protection offered by the permits.</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said the city had undertaken preliminary research and action to ensure more residents receive permits in the event of restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already researched the area and updated our lists, so that the lists we give to the mail house will be more accurate next time,” Kushnerov said. “There will be additional costs because there’s more postage required to send out more permits, but those costs are minimal.”</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said although the rain could have been a major factor in Halloween’s low attendance, the council believes the permits could be very beneficial, especially with the citizens approval during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“Last year was an interesting year in terms of Halloween because of the rain, so we don’t have a great picture of what impact the parking permits played,” Kushnerov said. “What we do know is that our residents were very happy that the city put in place a program to help minimize impacts to their neighborhoods during Halloween and have asked the city council to continue the program for future events.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College fourth-year psychology major and I.V. resident Austin Thomas said parking is a major problem in I.V. even when there is no event on the weekend.</p>\n<p>“The streets near my house are always crowded, so at times it can be hard for me to find parking by my own house,” Thomas said. “It can get really frustrating because those people might not even be residents, but out-of-towners here for the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Thomas said he thought the use of parking permits would ensure that residents have guaranteed parking during Deltopia and will allow them to enjoy the festivities without worry.</p>\n<p>“I would feel better for the safety of my car and my house if I knew it was just residents parking in our neighborhoods,” Thomas said. “It would be a lot easier to enjoy Deltopia with that peace of mind.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The eviction notices gave the tenants, all low-income long-term residents, 60 days to vacate the apartments, according to the Isla Vista Tenants Union.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) announced the beginning of a campaign on Tuesday to provide required financial assistance to five households allegedly evicted from Abrego Villas on 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd. in Isla Vista this past October.</p>\n<p>Following the evictions, which were issued without justification by Abrego Apartments, LLC, under Van Nuys property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the units in Abrego Villas were renovated and the rent was allegedly increased by over 50 percent, which made the units too expensive for former tenants to re-enter. These cases are the latest in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">a series of past evictions</a>, and under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, individuals evicted from households on County land are entitled to relocation benefits in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>In August, six households were allegedly served eviction notices by their landlord at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd., one in one building and five in the other. According to the IVTU, the eviction notices gave the tenants — all of whom were low-income, long-term residents, and many of whom were Latino families — 60 days to vacate the apartments.</p>\n<p>The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and an IVTU-provided lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to the property owner, Majestic Asset Management, LLC refused to grant them benefits and the tenants challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>According to the Advising Attorney at the A.S. Legal Resource Center Robin Unander, Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444 does not take effect in every situation.</p>\n<p>“The interesting thing about the ordinance is that it applies under very limited circumstances,” Unander said. “So what we’ve seen, because these property owners are not coming forward when they decide to make these changes is, they don’t tell the residents, ‘Oh guess what we’re gonna do all this, but we’re gonna offer you some relocation benefits.’”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community. Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs. — IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unander also said each evicted household is entitled to up to $10,500 in benefits, paid by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, under Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made that known to Majestic and they said, ‘We’ll give them a $1,000 and a security deposit.’” Unander said. “So when we weren’t able to get past that in November or December when it stalled, we filed small claims.”</p>\n<p>However, Majestic Asset Management, LLC has taken the position that the Ordinance 4444 does not apply to them, Unander said.</p>\n<p>“Their position is based on the fact that, before the tenants vacated, the tenants were given 60 days notice,” Unander said, “and before the 60 days were up, before the tenants actually vacated, Majestic was made aware by me that this situation might exist.”</p>\n<p>According to IVTU President and third-year econometrics major Andrey Bogdanov, the property owners attempted to remedy the situation by canceling some evictions, but the effort came too late as the tenants had secured replacement housing by the time the offer was made.</p>\n<p>“Even if they were allowed to stay they couldn’t technically move back in because they can’t have two leases at the same time,” Bogdanov said, “or even if they could move back in, even if that was legally possible, they wouldn’t be able to afford the rent.”</p>\n<p>Representatives for Majestic Asset Management, LLC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Majestic Asset Management, LLC evicted a select number of their tenants and made sure to do no renovations that required permits so as to not trigger the benefits enacted by Ordinance 4444. She also said that once the County became aware of what Majestic Asset Management, LLC was doing, the county ordered the company to cease until they acquired permits. However, the tenants had already signed permanent contracts to live elsewhere when the company offered them the chance to come back.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the things that takes them out of the benefits,” Unander said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the housing market in I.V. is significantly saturated, allowing unexpected evictions to substantially alter the livelihoods of some residents, especially if they are low-income or have children, Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p>“This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community,” Bogdanov said. “Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov also said the eviction timing has put a toll on tenants who have consequently had to struggle to find housing.</p>\n<p>“Because they weren’t evicted during the leasing season, in October it’s very difficult to find quality housing in,” Bogdanov said. “Six tenants may not seem like a large number, but since 2002 over 300 households have been evicted.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60000\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60000\" data-attachment-id=\"60000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/tenants_lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421917242\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=715%2C476\" alt=\"The Isla Vista Tenants Union has recently undertaken a campaign to offer financial support to tenants that were evicted without notice last August.

Seconds after units cleared the call, the roommate flagged down the IVFP officers in the street and stated that Michael B was brandishing a knife. After investigation, Michael B was arrested on a citizen’s arrest for brandishing a weapon and battery.</p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, officers also learned Michael B had two legally registered rifles, a modified AK-47 and a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun in the house, which Michael B agreed to turn over to the officers for safekeeping. In addition, the roommate agreed to turn over his gas pistol to the officers for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the AK-47 had been professionally modified to fit legal California firearm standards and not function as an assault rifle, which has been prohibited in California since the 1989 approval of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is that it fires single rounds at a time instead of automatic,” Plastino said. “It still fires a 7.62mm round, which is still the standard size round for an AK-47.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, because Michael B did not use the firearms in any act of violence nor give any indication that he would, he was not legally required to relinquish possession of his guns, although Plastino believes Michael B was correct to do so.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the guy made a good decision,” Plastino said. “He made a thoughtful decision in allowing us to take his weapons from him because he didn’t have to. He committed a sort of violent crime, brandishing a knife, so he needs to cool off and calm down before we’ll return his weapons to him.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle with four juveniles and one adult inside during a routine traffic stop because the headlights were turned off while the car was in motion. The driver, a juvenile, was under the influence of alcohol, while two more passengers were intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana with the other two passengers in possession of cocaine. All subjects were cited and their parents called to pick them up. The legal adult, 18-year-old Michael Davis, was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday night, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a female was approached and verbally assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Carrington Cox, outside of 7-11. When the victim’s current boyfriend stepped in to intervene, a shoving match ensued, at which point Cox struck the victim’s current boyfriend in the face with a skateboard. Cox then broke free of the scuffle and ran towards his ex-girlfriend, stomping on her left leg and fleeing south on El Embarcadero. The female victim sustained a fractured tibia and extensive knee injuries.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Delta Gamma sorority requested extra patrol in light of the social media shooting rumors, during which officers noticed Santa Barbara City College student Joshua McKenzie Smith at an upstairs, outside door of the sorority house. Plastino said Smith tried the door to see if it would open and claimed to be trying to find the residence of his friend, Tom. He was then arrested for public intoxication and prowling.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers also noted that on Sunday there were more crowds out than a usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, during which there were miscellaneous alcohol and noise ordinance citations issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/","id":4772,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4771,4770,4769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Possible Isla Vista Community Center Discussed","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Office of Assemblymember Das Williams held the latest in a series of conversations about Isla Vista self-governance this past Tuesday night in the I.V.

During the march, over 100 demonstrators walked from Little Acorn Park to Del Playa, then proceeded to walk up and down Del Playa chanting “End rape culture!” and “Consent is an enthusiastic yes!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment. – Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund said Bhavnani, who is also Chair of the Academic Senate, prompted her students to organize an event that addressed what they felt were the most prevalent issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Immediately, rape culture surfaced as the biggest issue for all of us.

End rape culture.” According to Westerlund, event organizers intentionally staged the march on Del Playa in order to bring attention to sexual assault in an area that has historically typified what many students see as the party culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We planned the walk for DP on a Friday night in order to reach the target audience,” Westerlund said. “DP is always filled with students, often intoxicated, looking or headed towards a party. This group is especially at risk of rape, sexual assault or harassment. We wanted to bring the problem to light in its own arena.”</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, many students and I.V. residents cheered and clapped from their Del Playa balconies, high-fived participants or took videos of the passing crowd.</p>\n<p>Organizers invited students to participate in the demonstration via Facebook in order to facilitate discussion on rape culture in I.V., third-year sociology major and event coordinator Zoe Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>“This is an interactive event to help make known that there does exist in Isla Vista a rape culture and this we hope will provide a space where students can comfortably confront rape culture,” Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.]. To end the, ‘Well what was she wearing?’ and ‘Was she drunk?’ questions, and to end the society that makes these questions okay. – Third-year global studies major Claire Breen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Patrice Trowbridge said gender roles in I.V. play a large part in shaping the presence of rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“To me rape culture is every person that feels entitled to sex and every person that feels obligated to give it. And that’s so pervasive in I.V. The way we look at gender leads to rape but people don’t see that,” Trowbridge said. “Hopefully if we make it hard to ignore it will start some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Jonathan Gonzalez, a fourth-year political science major and Vice President of Sigma Lambda Beta fraternity’s local chapter, rape is just as much a male issue as it is a female issue and should be addressed equally by both sexes.</p>\n<p>“Instead of teaching girls to be careful and to watch their backs, we should be teaching the boys to not rape. Our current generation is the next generation of parents so it’s up to us to get educated and educate our boys and girls,” said Gonzalez. “Boys and girls were stopping their normal weekend partying to cheer and chant with us.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity member Carlos Maldonado said rape culture is a topic that needs to be given immediate attention, especially within organizations that face controversy regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a fraternity member, it is essential to be present at these important events so that we may raise awareness and establish accountability within our own organizations so that we do not perpetuate this culture,” said Maldonado.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59843\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59843\" data-attachment-id=\"59843\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59843\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=253%2C168\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major Claire Breen, event attendees marched in order to empower others to participate in the local and nationwide movement toward ending rape culture.</p>\n<p>“I think that rape culture is horrifically prevalent not only in Isla Vista, but on all college campuses in the United States,” said Breen. “I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.].

id=\"caption-attachment-59803\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Community members met at the Isla Vista Clinic on Thursday Jan. 15 to discuss the history of Isla Vista, and the movement toward self-governance. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, faculty and Isla Vista residents met at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar yesterday to discuss the history of I.V. as well as problems facing the I.V. self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>The event was co-organized by volunteer group Isla Vista Collective, I.V. Coalition and individual residents, students and academic staff. I.V. Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders led the meeting, inviting participants to list “trials and triumphs” in I.V. history, including the creation of the I.V. Food Co-op, the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), I.V. Elementary School and the maintenance of I.V.’s many parks. Other points of I.V history discussed included episodes of violence, sexual assault and what some alleged as the increasing presence gentrification in I.V.</p>\n<p>Last year, Chancellor Henry T. Yang established the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V. in order to increase the university’s presence in the campus’s neighboring college town.</p>\n<p>According to physics professor Harry Nelson, who is also a member of the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V., there could be problems facing the university if administration tries to intervene in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“Spending money from the University of California, not just UCSB, but the entire University of California on a thing like Isla Vista is a very hard thing to do it turns out, at least with public money,” Nelson said. “Every time you think you have an idea, there’s a vetting process, and a consideration, until someone says, ‘You know, local government is the responsibility of something else in California’s organization, not universities.’”</p>\n<p>As a public university, UCSB faces regulatory and monetary issues that differentiate it from schools with different funding models, Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is not a private institution. If we were Stanford it would be totally different,” Nelson said. “There’s totally fewer regulations and requirements. UCSB being public, we have a lot of extra responsibilities with public money.”</p>\n<p>Nelson also said there are a great deal of alumni who feel passionately about I.V. and could potentially contribute to improving it.</p>\n<p>“One thing that’s interesting about Isla Vista is that over the past 50 years, maybe 4,000 students have come through each year,” Nelson said. “You do the math, that’s 200,000 people out there, predominantly in California, who universally love Isla Vista. That’s a very interesting phenomenon that’s never been tapped into.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Constance Brown said she is concerned with the ever-growing population of youth in I.V., a trend that she said she has seen over the past several decades.</p>\n<p>“It’s an undercurrent that, if not corrected, I simply have no hope for I.V. And that is, we used to have some hundreds of mature adults living in single-family homes,” Brown said. “And they used to be maybe professionals, two people, families, but they were stable adults.”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, an older demographic of I.V. residents would balance out the “craziness” caused by the large population of youth in I.V., a phenomenon she alleges has steered I.V. “out of control.”</p>\n<p>“They’re [older residents] virtually gone. There are a handful of us left. But all of those family homes that were a buffer, that created stability, they’re all filled with young people,” Brown said. “You see really nothing but young people out there, and they’re crammed in. Once Isla Vista is wall-to-wall young people, I don’t see any hope for Isla Vista. You cannot contain that amount of young people, all they see is other young people. It’s like Lord of the Flies.”</p>\n<p>In addition, fourth-year global studies major and IVRPD Board of Directors member Jacob Lebell said parking congestion might create a climate detrimental to residents if I.V.’s population continues to increase.</p>\n<p>“I think what kind of gives people permission to act without rules in many ways is that with parking impacted how it is, a lot of I.V. has the feeling of a parking lot and I think that sets kind of the mindset and the environment that a lot of people are acting in,” Lebell said. “It’s a place to kind of put things. That isn’t community space.”</p>\n<p>The meeting was part of an ongoing conversation regarding the I.V. self-governance movement that began <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/\">last Spring</a>. Future meetings will continue to be held the third Thursday of every month in the I.V.

The walk aims to address issues regarding sexual assault and gender stereotypes in I.V.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major and event organizer Diana Figueroa said the event idea first came about when Bhavnani invited students from her SOC156A class to discuss issues regarding I.V. with her over dinner.</p>\n<p>“We were like ‘You know what? It would be cool if we had a march to show people in I.V. who are in the party scene that rape culture exists,’” Figueroa said.</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, the main goal of the march is to draw attention to sexual violence, especially against women, and its prevalence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We really want people to start the conversation, but we don’t only want discussion, we want action,” Figueroa said. “We want other people to make a stand and do something about it … We want this event to start a catalyst of other events about rape culture and see this issue gain more attention.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Akshaya Natarajan said she is looking forward to participating in the march and thinks it is vital to shed light on cultural practices in I.V. that promote— instead of combat — instances of sexual violence or harassment.</p>\n<p>“As a first year, I don’t have much experience with people and the direct effects of rape culture, but it’s easy to see the direct effects with people using rape as a slang term and unnecessarily catcalling women in the street,” Natarajan said. “I think the march on DP is really cool and I’m excited to go.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators plan to march on Friday at 10 p.m., when parties typically occur and when Del Playa is generally crowded, in order to make a statement that aims to strongly impact students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Rape happens more commonly during parties where people are intoxicated, and marching on Del Playa, where the most amount of parties occur with the highest amount of people, will be confronting the problem where it happens most,” Figueroa said. “It will be spreading the message to everyone that this stuff happens and it can happen to anyone partying out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, marching on Del Playa will send a powerful message to students and I.V. residents occupying parties on the oft-crowded streets Friday night.</p>\n<p>“I think that they’re doing that on DP on a Friday night will really have a lasting effect,” Natarajan said. “It’s a bunch of people walking together, making a stance and calling people out who participate in rape culture. I don’t know how it will turn out — there’s always risks walking in a big group on DP, but I think it will be powerful one way or another. ”</p>\n<p>Figueroa said she expects to have a couple hundred people attend, however according to her the significance of the event should not be measured by how many people participate, but rather by the march’s impact on students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really matter how many people walk with us so long as people see us and see what we’re standing for and what we’re talking about,” Figueroa said. “And this hopefully starts dialogue among other people while they’re out partying and remind them that this stuff happens when people do party.”</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, fear of sexual assault or harassment should not be an issue in I.V., as individuals should feel secure in their neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“I think at the end of the day, we just want women to feel safe going out,” Figueroa said. “We want men to realize that they play an important role in rape culture and that we need their help in ending rape culture as well. Unfortunately it exists and we have to teach people not to rape and warn women about the dangers of going out and dressing a certain way. It shouldn’t be an issue.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and a second-year physics major Liam Stanton said it is “incredibly important” that issues regarding sexual violence and harassment are addressed by “everyone in the UCSB and Isla Vista community, male, female, or otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“As a Senator, I particularly view it as one of my first responsibilities to support any movement seeking to combat rape culture and its implications in society, especially given the events which have historically plagued our community,” Stanton said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, students are ultimately responsible for stopping the abuses associated with rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture starts and ends with the students,” Natarajan said. “UCSB can implement all the rules they want but there’s still an underlying problem, and we need to make a stand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/","id":4804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4803,4802,4801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 9-11","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the eld...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the elderly and theft.</p>\n<p>According to a weekly crime report, during the night shift last Wednesday law enforcement officers attempted to issue a noise ordinance violation on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. During the confrontation with a resident of the home, the officers noticed a student attempting to conceal half an ounce of marijuana for which he did not have a medical card by destroying it. When the officers approached the individual, he provided a false identity and was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p>The following day, officers stopped a vehicle from “Jump on the School Bus” transportation while it was loading passengers on Ocean Road and Trigo Road. The bus was playing excessively loud music and honking its horn to catch the attention of potential nearby riders, which led to the officers on patrol to question bus driver Nicholas Zwart. UCPD officers cited Zwart for not having insurance, and warned Zwart against loading the bus on campus.</p>\n<p>This past Friday officers logged 9 arrests and 22 citations, with a notable charge for abuse of the elderly. Officers were called to check the welfare of a 68-year-old amputee and Vietnam War veteran at Friendship Manor on Friday night. The victim’s caretaker, Russell Tokle, had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Upon entering his apartment, the officers found it unsanitary to the point of being uninhabitable, littered with things like cat feces and rotten food. Tokle was arrested for his previous warrant and is under view for elder abuse. The victim was granted an immediate move out of the apartment and taken into the care of Adult Protective Services.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, officers responded to a noise citation on the 6500 block of Segovia. Around midnight, the resident said he would turn down his loud music, but at 2 a.m. the music resumed its high volume. Officers returned to the residence, shut down the party and issued a noise citation. As party-goers filed onto the street from the party, law enforcement officers noticed one man too intoxicated to take care of himself. While attempting to place him into the patrol car, a fellow student interfered, attempting to stop officers from arresting the man. Following the altercation, both students were arrested for a drunk in public citation and a citation for interfering with law enforcement, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP units responded to a theft call at the Subway on Pardall Road. Upon arrival, officers found the victim fighting with the suspected perpetrator and ended the conflict immediately. During the investigation, deputies determined that the suspect was in possession of the victim’s backpack, an iPhone and several other stolen items. The suspect was then arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to a call about a male breaking a window at the 7-Eleven on Seville Road this past Saturday. IVFP deputies located the suspect, Larry Anthony Ortiz, who was covered in blood and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Ortiz had broken a window at 7-Eleven, along with a window of a nearby car parked on Sabado Tarde. Ortiz was arrested for vandalism and later charged with battery against a police officer after spitting in the deputy’s face.</p>\n<p>Deputies responded to another report of vandalism on Sunday, this time at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar. Upon arrival, police observed another broken window and blood spatter in the area. Deputies believe this incident to be related to the vandalism arrest from the night before.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59688\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59688\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/","id":4796,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4795,4794,4793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss I.V.

Self-Governance Bill. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students met in the Associated Students Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) yesterday to discuss different services that could be helpful to Isla Vista and to develop clearer goals for CA state Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill for I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) seeks to create a Community Services District (CSD) governance for I.V. which would empower a local governmental board exclusive to I.V. to authorize and execute services and infrastructure projects for the area using locally sourced revenues. Williams’ office is facilitating multiple discussions with different stakeholders, with today’s discussion focusing on capturing student perspectives on what type of services they want in I.V.</p>\n<p>Other issues discussed at the meeting included the role of housing and utility taxes to pay for services, creating a community center and “safe space” in I.V., altering community policing and creating bicycle lanes on the streets.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he thinks that while specific services like a community center or underground facilities could be helpful in I.V., it is important to focus on the long term future and explore how a CSD will be sustained moving forward.</p>\n<p>“For me, the big picture here is [that] even if I think it’s a realistic approach, we’re not going to get all these services at one time. There just isn’t enough money in the world for that,” Schunk said. “But what we can do is prioritize a few and say that these are the most important to us and from there what we can do is really create a system that will benefit those in the long term.”</p>\n<p>One of the concerns raised at a prior stakeholder’s meeting last week was that AB3 was coming from Williams and his office without enough contribution from students and other I.V. residents.<br>\nBut according to Ashley Kruzel, a State Assembly field representative for Williams, since Williams’ office is facilitating the bill and because it has to go through the legislative process, it must come from Williams’ office or CA state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s office, as she represents Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Das can introduce a bill, I can’t introduce a bill, you can’t,” Kruzel said, “It has to come from Das or Hannah-Beth because obviously no one else gives a shit about Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>During the forum at the MCC, Schunk discussed the potential of implementing utility taxes in a future CSD-type of self-governance for I.V. as opposed to implementing a property tax. With a utilities tax, I.V. residents would be able to see exactly what they are being charged for instead of unknowingly increasing the overall cost of living without transparency, Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“I think that for a lot of people [a utilities tax] will provide that transparency that people are looking for and I think that a lot of people would desire [it] as opposed to property tax that may be a little bit more elusive,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>EVPLA office member and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she wants to convince students that these taxes could be beneficial in the long run.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s really important, because how are we going to tell students, ‘This is what’s going on. Self-governance is going on and your utilities are going to go up,’ plus tuition’s going up,” Melgoza said, “so we just have to find an effective way of making them see like, this is going to help long-term.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he believes students should consider the perspectives and needs of long-term residents when thinking about changes to the community.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s a lot of antagonism between students and long-term residents and I just want to remind everyone … that they are people, that they have lives and families like you, that they have hopes and dreams like you do,” Schunk said. “The one thing I want to encourage everyone to do is try to see them as people and try as hard as you can to really connect with them on a human level because you’d be amazed at how similarly they see this place to you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said that having an open discussion on self-governance with every constituent of I.V. is vital to ensuring optimum success with the proposed bill.</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing though is that we don’t let this become a students versus others kind of debate,” Schunk said. “I think moving forward, if students can keep in mind, that we owe it to this community to be members of the community. Then I think we’ll have much better dialogue also.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/","id":4803,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[4802,4801,4800],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":29,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
