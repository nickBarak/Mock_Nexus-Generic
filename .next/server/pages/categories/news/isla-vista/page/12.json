Foot Patrol (IVFP) first found a 23-year-old man unconscious with “ineffective breathing” at an apartment complex near the 800 block of Embarcadero Del Mar at approximately 12:50 a.m. on Dec. 25, SBSO said in a press release.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies arrived in minutes and found the victim turning purple and unable to breathe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police administered a single dose of Naloxone after assessing the signs as symptoms of an overdose, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naloxone is an intra-nasal spray that blocks or reverses the effects of opioids, including drowsiness, slowed breathing or loss of consciousness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then began to breathe more easily and regained consciousness in minutes. Paramedics took over care of the victim and transported him to the hospital for further treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Police Department, IVFP and Santa Barbara County Fire Department later responded to a report of an “unresponsive” 20-year-old male overdosing at an apartment complex on the 6600 block of Abrego Road at approximately 10:56 p.m. on Monday, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim was “barely breathing” and starting to turn purple, according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement found an individual trying to resuscitate the victim. Police took over and administered a single dose of Naloxone to the victim. The victim then regained consciousness, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police used an </span>automated external defibrillator<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to monitor the victim’s heartbeat until the victim began to breathe by himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paramedics then transported the victim to the hospital for further treatment, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All SBSO deputies receive training on the use of Naloxone, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In

The change will be used to purchase basic needs for evacuees, such as food and personal care items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business has received over $1,000 in donations from the program and a few direct donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op’s food donation bin is available by the front door. Customers can donate non-perishable items that  are unopened and have non-breakable packaging. Items must also have an expiration date printed on the package. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donated items will be given to the Red Cross Evacuation Site and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura County Food Banks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen said residents have donated several hundred dollars in food donations so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She credited assistant store manager Rebecca Roberts with the idea to create a food donation site at the co-op and said the entire process has been a “team decision.” They wanted to save people the trip of donating the food directly to the shelters because the co-op was going to visit the shelters regardless, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the business has been able to offer the 15 percent discount to several people and are hoping that business will increase once evacuees have moved back into their homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the fire entered Santa Barbara County, the co-op was working to donate food to the UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/thomas-fire-evacuees-hope-to-return-home-soon-ucsb-evacuation-center-remains-open/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evacuation center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that had been set up in the Multi-Activity Center. The business brought approximately $600 worth of “special diet” food to the shelter, according to Cohen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Items donated to the evacuation center included yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, oat bars, protein bars, soup cups, plant and animal jerky sticks, bananas and other fresh food items.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire began on Dec. 4 and has since spread rapidly across the Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It is now at 272,000 acres and is 60 percent contained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fire caused </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/ucsb-i-v-lose-power-over-10-times-throughout-sunday-night-due-to-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">power outages</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. and on campus during the last two weeks of classes before winter break and led Chancellor Henry T.

Currently, internet service providers like Verizon and AT&amp;T can’t charge websites to deliver content faster than other websites.</p>\n<p>The FCC now plans to vote on a repeal of network neutrality on Dec. 14, which would allow internet service providers to potentially serve users with extra charges and block, slow or speed up access to specific websites.</p>\n<p>Dylan Bolf, UC Santa Barbara Residential Computer Network (ResNet) technician, said that because UCSB purchases its bandwidth in bulk from a Tier 1 network, it was treated “neutrally” before the 2015 regulations were in place.</p>\n<p>A Tier 1 network is the overarching “backbone” of the internet, according to Bolf. By purchasing from a Tier 1 network, the university acts as a service provider for students.</p>\n<p>Regular consumers buy internet from Tier 3, which includes internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Cox, and would be subject to the new rules.</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, a software engineer and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District, explained that service providers like Comcast may want to repeal net neutrality to reduce risk and manage costs.</p>\n<p>Because customers demand unlimited internet plans to handle all their needs, Freeman said service companies must anticipate internet usage and predict how it might spike or fluctuate in the future.</p>\n<p>“They have essentially forced internet service providers in this horrible position of being insurance companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Their response to this is ‘we want the ability to charge somebody for the increase in bandwidth use by Netflix, whether it be Netflix or whether it be the user watching Netflix’… That is an argument that I can appreciate,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“It is still an argument that I find scary because I’ve seen absolute power corrupt absolutely,” he said.</p>\n<p>If the repeal goes through, the FCC would essentially restore “the internet to the state that it was two years ago,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Before Obama-era rules were implemented, residential users were the target of “extra charges and other net neutrality violating ideas,” Bolf said.</p>\n<p>For example, AT&amp;T blocked Apple’s FaceTime app from its data plan in 2012. If customers wanted to use the FaceTime app outside of Wi-Fi, they had to pay extra for an unlimited plan.</p>\n<p>Open internet advocacy groups claimed this was a violation of net neutrality, and AT&amp;T backed down before the groups filed an official complaint with the FCC.</p>\n<p>“We hope that we will be treated neutrally again if these rules are repealed, and would not violate the principles of net neutrality ourselves,” Bolf said in an email, explaining that UCSB would not manipulate the speed of any website.</p>\n<p>He added that ResNet “stands unanimously” behind the current net neutrality rules and hopes they remain in place.</p>\n<p>However, if the FCC does moves forward with the repeal, Bolf said ResNet would make sure the “students and residents are not impacted in any way that we can.”</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, UCSB’s associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said a cable company could artificially limit bandwidth to make certain services more appealing.</p>\n<p>“Imagine if AT&amp;T is the exclusive partner of Spotify and you can’t get Pandora on AT&amp;T without it hitting your bandwidth cap,” Hall said in an email.</p>\n<p>There will be an economic, innovational and choice impact to consumers in residential areas, Hall said, but “life on our UC campuses continues unchanged in the short term.”</p>\n<p>State senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents all of Santa Barbara County and western Ventura County, opposed the repeal saying it would set a “very dangerous precedent.”</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing is that [the repeal] will allow money interests to control content, to control access, to ultimately control thought,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said large, wealthy institutions like universities would be able to afford higher-quality internet, while a student startup wouldn’t be able to compete with large businesses.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure the internet is a fair and even playing field for all and continue to bridge our country’s existing digital divide,” he said. “That disparity will only grow if we do not act to protect net neutrality rules.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Dec. 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Tenants brought their issues with renting in I.V. to the I.V. Tenants Union’s town hall. Will Tran / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, chair of the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and a fourth-year political science and communications double major, led the town hall in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic building. The majority of the students present were Associated Students (A.S.) senators who spoke of their own issues with I.V. landlords.</p>\n<p>Several tenants expressed frustration about communicating with their landlords, citing incidents where their landlords had not responded to repeated emails or texts.</p>\n<p>Ron Perry, A.S. Legal Resource Center Staff Attorney, said that physical correspondence like “snail mail” is still the best way to communicate with landlords in the event of an issue, because some judges “still have a hard time with electronic communication” in court.</p>\n<p>He added that students should “always document” any communication that happens between themselves and their landlords.</p>\n<p>Anthony Pimentel, an A.S. off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said he has had disputes with his landlord in the past over getting his full security deposit back.</p>\n<p>“We’re only expecting a few hundred at worst to be deducted from our security deposit for average wear and tears,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said he was charged “outrageous prices” for carpet replacement, as well as for appliances and paint jobs throughout the house that had already been worn down before they moved in. He said he photographed these before moving in.</p>\n<p>Perry encouraged students to check landlords’ previous court disputes before signing a housing contract and to take pictures of the condition of the house before moving in like Pimentel had done.</p>\n<p>“We see the same landlords over and over and over again,” Perry said. “There’s a record of that, of course, you can go to the court or go online.”</p>\n<p>Renteria said that issues between tenants and landlords arise when students rent from “a few large corporations and multi-millionaire landlords” that “have overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Renteria also said that I.V.’s limited housing contributes to poor landlord-tenant relations, claiming that I.V. has a vacancy rate of under half of a percent. A “healthy” housing market has a vacancy rate of five percent, he said.</p>\n<p>Some students in attendance expressed concerns about the lack of carbon monoxide detectors and fire alarms in their apartments, as well as issues with returns on security deposits.</p>\n<p>Landlords are required to have carbon monoxide detectors in apartments and failure to do so is in violation of California law, Perry said.</p>\n<p>“If you convince the judge that your landlord knew about his obligations under the law and just plain didn’t do it, you could get three times your security deposit back,” Perry said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, a third-year history of public policy major and I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board member, said that landlords are often aware that their tenants are first-time renters and do not know their legal rights before renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Many of these [landlords] are large, out of town housing conglomerates who provide little-to-no customer service to their tenants,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD began discussions for the creation of a landlord-tenant mediation program last Tuesday but have yet to make a final decision.</p>\n<p>Renteria also condemned the actions of Del Playa Rentals owner James Gelb, who yelled homophobic slurs at I.V. CSD president Ethan Bertrand on Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Tenants Union strongly believes that not a single person should endure abuses in any form or shape,” Renteria said, reading a statement from IVTU.</p>\n<p>Perry held a question and answer session after the meeting for students who needed specific legal advice and advised students to come to the Legal Resource Center before renting in I.V. so that they are fully aware of their rights as tenants.</p>\n<p>The center is located on the second floor of the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>IVTU plans to hold a second town hall during the end of Winter Quarter to further help “reconcile differences” between landlords and tenants, Renteria said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-78802\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The new program would mediate disputes between tenants and landlords in Isla Vista in collaboration with the many organizations that currently provide different aspects of the dispute resolution process, including the Isla Vista Tenants Union, UC Santa Barbara’s Community Housing Office and others in the area.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) has not yet decided the program’s specifics but board members have called its creation a “top priority.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB3\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3)</a>, which paved the way for the I.V. CSD’s creation with its passage in 2015, provided the district the power to create a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand gave a presentation about similar tenant mediation programs during the CSD’s Tuesday meeting and said I.V. residents have reached out for assistance with tenant-landlord mediation in the past.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents contacted the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program for help 64 times in the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year. This is the highest usage rate of by an unincorporated area of the county and nearly double the rate of the community with the second highest usage, according to the presentation.</p>\n<p>Tenants reached out to the mediation program mostly for security deposit refunds, lease terminations, habitability and repair issues and rent increase disputes.</p>\n<p>IVTU provides education and advocacy for tenants and some case work for rental housing issues and the UCSB Community Housing Office provides some dispute resolution and mediation.</p>\n<p>The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County also provides information about tenants’ rights and responsibilities, but there is yet to be a service that unites all areas of tenant-landlord issues for all residents.</p>\n<p>Bertrand compared mediation programs in the cities of Palo Alto and Santa Barbara to I.V., which he said has a need for a similar program considering the size of the population and its requests for help from tenant organizations.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Tuesday’s discussion was the board of directors’ first time discussing tenant-landlord mediation programs and said he hopes to discuss the program’s creation with other I.V. stakeholders as the board moves forward.</p>\n<p>If the CSD chooses, it can make its mediation program mandatory through an ordinance, though a majority of board members have said they would first like to create a successful voluntary program before mandating mediation for disputes.</p>\n<p>He said some tenant mediation programs passed by local governments have included provisions for mandatory mediation programs but believes public input is necessary before the CSD makes any program mandatory.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to learning more about the community’s desire for a tenant mediation program and ordinance … The purpose of last night’s presentation was to show examples of what other communities have done to bolster tenant protections,” Bertrand said in an email.</p>\n<p>Some board members have come out in favor of a mandatory tenant mediation program but also say the program must acquire funding and become effective before it can ever become mandatory.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board member Bob Geis said the district should fund the program through the user utility tax that the board is working to bring to the voters by next year.</p>\n<p>Board members are still debating the exact percentage of the tax that will go on next year’s ballot. The utility tax fell short of the 66 percent vote it needed last year, with 61.22 percent of the vote, when Measure F asked voters for an 8 percent tax on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD board member and secretary, said a mediation program could create a difference in the way that landlords treat tenants.</p>\n<p>“Customer service to their tenants is not something that is prioritized or even needed because our rental housing market is just so — there’s no choice … There’s no places you can go if you don’t like your landlord,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said a mandatory program similar to the city of Palo Alto’s could make landlords more responsive when it comes to repairs, security deposit issues and resolving other disputes.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/","id":4352,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4351,4350,4349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Freebies and Activities in Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I.V. indie rock band Frisson will play their first show of the new school year on Saturday, Dec. 2 from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m at 6694 Del Playa Drive.

Courtesy of Eli Bahar</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat Yoga is a fitness trend that began in 2016 and has been considered a type of animal therapy. During a goat yoga class, goats interact with participants by jumping on participants’ backs or snuggling on the yoga mat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goat yoga class in I.V. will be held at the Santa Barbara Hillel this upcoming Saturday, Dec. 2, at 11 a.m. A maximum of 50 people are allowed in the class, and the class will cost $40 per participant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Bahar, a second-year undeclared major and host of the event, said goat yoga is more beneficial than regular yoga because the interaction with goats releases endorphins, which stimulates a positive feeling in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It connects you to the people around you and provides a friendly atmosphere,” Bahar said. “It is more than zen and more of an experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar grew up in Los Angeles and said he discovered goat yoga last August. He was on a waitlist for three months before he could participate because there is only one studio in Los Angeles that offers the unique yoga class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an amazing experience and a crazy wild adrenaline rush. You are just surrounded by people having a good time,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar said he wanted to bring goat yoga to I.V. because UCSB students “stress out and don’t find time for themselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar contacted a farm in Sun Valley, Calif. that brings certified goats to yoga events. It is “fairly expensive” to bring this experience to Isla Vista, Bahar said, but he expects a good turnout at the class.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga was created by Lainey Morse, a goat owner from Albany, Oreg. Morse was encouraged by a local yoga instructor to connect her love of goats with the practice of yoga. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga is animal-assisted therapy, according to Morse’s </span><a href=\"https://goatyoga.net/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is an “unbelievable distraction” from work, politics or sickness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not Bahar’s first time helping students destress before finals. He also started a business called Party Ice which delivers ice cream sandwiches to residents in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall the week before midterms and finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Goat yoga is a step above Party Ice and is still a way to help people destress,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those interested in signing up for goat yoga can email Bahar at </span><em><a href=\"mailto:ivgoatyoga@gmail.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivgoatyoga@gmail.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/","id":4353,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[4352,4351,4350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Juice It Up!

The new store opened next to HiWi Tropical Fusion on 6555 Pardall Road as part of a franchise partnership between the two stores.</p>\n<p>The juice bar will sell blended smoothies, açaí and pitaya bowls and pressed and raw juices.</p>\n<p>The Friday grand opening included live music, prize giveaways and local vendor product samplings.</p>\n<p>Monica Martinez, president of HiWi Inc. and the new Juice It Up! location, said the company wanted to bring the juice bar to I.V. to offer a healthy food option to the UC Santa Barbara campus and community.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! will not serve beer or wine, Martinez said, because “there’s already enough alcohol in I.V.”</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s really good for profit, but we’re not here just for profit. We’re really here to try to be a sustainable business,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! is one of many raw juice bar companies HiWi Fusion considered partnering with before making their final decision. Other candidates for the juice locale included Jamba Juice and Maui Wowi.</p>\n<p>Martinez said she chose to partner with Juice It Up! because of its high quality products.</p>\n<p>“They actually have a full-time food scientist who does hours and hours of testing to make sure that it’s the best and healthiest product out there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up!’s notability as a brand was also a factor in the final decision, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“People would be more familiar with something that they’re used to,” said Martinez. “There are a lot of students at UCSB that are from Southern California, and Juice It Up! is originally from Southern California.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said she hopes the option to order Juice It Up! online will be helpful for students that do not have time to eat breakfast. Customers can place an order online and pick it up on their way to class, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“Most students do not have time to stop and eat breakfast, so a smoothie or a bowl or a protein shake or raw juice is often a quick breakfast for them,” she said. “They’ll have their drink ready to go and they can have their breakfast on their way to class.”</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! takes online orders through their website <em>hiwifusion.com/menu</em> and offers pick-up and delivery through SBmenus and UberEATS.</p>\n<p>The new store will be open between 7 a.m. and 10:00 p.m Monday through Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/","id":4372,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[4371,4370,4369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stricter Dog Leash Regulation May Come to Some I.V.

Senate recommended the I.V. Tenants’ Union (IVTU) hold a town hall meeting with tenants and property owners to discuss relations between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>The IVTU plans to host a town hall meeting next Tuesday, Nov. 21, at 6 p.m. at the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to fourth-year Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and one of the resolution’s student sponsors.</p>\n<p>“Nobody should have to deal with this abusive behavior,” Renteria said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>“We support tenants rights to speak and organize against unjust housing conditions,” the resolution reads. “Housing is monopolized by a few large investment corporations and multimillionaire landlords who overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County tax rolls from 2015, Gelb had a property value of $39.3 million. The <i>Santa Barbara Independent’s </i><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/jun/11/isla-vista-investors-paradise/\">analysis</a> of the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District bedroom tax ranked him as the fifth wealthiest property owner in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>There are multiple videos and texts revealing altercations between Gelb and other Isla Vista tenants published online that are the “most troubling” to the Senate, the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh, a transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, said at the Senate meeting that he hopes the Tenants’ Union’s town hall can provide tenants and landlords a place to discuss their concerns and work to reach resolutions.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is in light of Gelb’s comments, but can include other interactions similar to this from other landlords,” Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7.

Morton said Gelb may have been the victim, witness, involved in the incident or the suspect in the four other investigations.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office (SBSO), Gelb has never been arrested by SBSO.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Rob Romero from the UC Police Department said UCPD has not received any formal complaints about Gelb.</p>\n<p>Lt. Ruben Cintron, spokesperson for the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), also said no formal complaints have been filed against Gelb.</p>\n<p>SBPD is currently investigating Gelb on charges of disturbing the peace after he was filmed yelling homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>The <i>Nexus</i> contacted nine rental companies and two independent landlords for comment on Gelb and Del Playa Rentals’ business practices and their working relationships with him.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. A friend of Bertrand’s filmed the incident.</p>\n<p>In the video, Bertrand confronted Gelb about the landlord’s decision to sell all of his 37 properties in I.V. and said he did not treat his tenants well.</p>\n<p>Gelb became upset and began to follow Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting homophobic slurs at Bertrand, who is openly gay.</p>\n<p>Morton said the incident on Tuesday was the police department’s fifth contact with Gelb for anything other than traffic violations or parking tickets.</p>\n<p>While this incident prompted the police’s first investigation of Gelb, I.V. residents have complained about Gelb and Del Playa Rentals for years.</p>\n<p>Ellis Dane Andersen, a former UC Santa Barbara student, said while he lived at one of Gelb’s residences, he often heard Gelb say homophobic and racist slurs to his friends and housemates.</p>\n<p>One day, Andersen said, Gelb began yelling homophobic slurs at Andersen’s friend, who was openly gay. The neighbors called the police due to the disturbance, Andersen said.</p>\n<p>Andersen said law enforcement did not take statements from the residents.</p>\n<p>Lt. Cintron could not comment on this event, but said in an email that IVFP has responded to calls that “do not rise to the level of a crime and could be considered a civil matter or an incident.”</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the Legal Resource Center in I.V., said she has received “consistent complaints” about Del Playa Rentals from tenants over the past 14 years of working at the Legal Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Unander said she has addressed complaints about issues including security deposits, maintenance problems at a residence and transfer of leases. She said tenants do not directly complain about Gelb’s treatment of students in the majority of complaints.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes they come in with concerns specifically about him and how he engages his tenants and how he interacts with them, but rarely do they come in complaining just about that,” Unander said. “Usually there’s something else going on.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) has been notified of complaints about Gelb and privacy concerns, as well as complaints about Gelb’s behavior towards students, by the Legal Resource Center, according to Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and fourth-year political science and communication double major.</p>\n<p>Anderson lived at a Del Playa Rentals residence from 2013 to 2014. He said while living at the residence, Gelb would oftentimes walk into the house without warning.</p>\n<p>“He had a key for our house and he would just break in and inspect,” Andersen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79643\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79643\" data-attachment-id=\"79643\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/gelbattack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=1665%2C889&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1665,889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gelb picture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=888%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79643\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack-1024x547.jpg?resize=888%2C474\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=768%2C410&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?w=1665&amp;ssl=1 1665w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals in I.V., began yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Ethan Bertrand, president of the I.V. Community Services District at around 8 p.m. on a sidewalk on State Street.</em></p></div>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU has received privacy complaints about other landlords as well, not only Gelb. He said the union has prioritized making tenants more aware of their right to privacy so landlords cannot abuse their power.</p>\n<p>IVTU will host a town hall next Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero del Mar to discuss how tenants and landlords can settle disputes.</p>\n<p>Many tenants have questioned why Gelb’s behavior has persisted for so long, but Unander said Gelb’s actions have not violated housing practices.</p>\n<p>“When he makes decisions about who he’s going to rent to, so far he hasn’t engaged in any discriminatory conduct,” Unander said. “He hasn’t refused to rent to people who are part of a protected class. He rents to everybody.”</p>\n<p>The protected class is a group of people with common characteristics that are legally protected from discrimination under U.S. law, including race, gender, age and citizenship.</p>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU does not have a working relationship with Gelb, and said Gelb does not attend the Community Housing Office’s quarterly meetings.</p>\n<p>About 75 to 100 I.V. landlords and property owners attend the meeting, Renteria said.</p>\n<p>“Gelb just never goes to those meetings,” he said. “I think that if given the opportunity, if he were to play an active role in the community with all these other property providers and other landlords, that could create a relationship.”</p>\n<p>According to Jenn Birchim, the Community Housing Office’s program manager, the Community Housing Office has worked with Janette McWeeney, Del Playa Rentals property manager, but never directly with Gelb.</p>\n<p>“It’s better to have a relationship with somebody than nobody,” Birchim said.</p>\n<p>Birchim said McWeeney worked with the university in January, when a bluff collapsed at 6653 Del Playa Drive, one of Gelb’s properties. The collapse left 28 residents without secure housing.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, a graduate student and general manager of the I.V. Community Services District, lived at one of Gelb’s properties on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive during the 2013 to 2014 school year.</p>\n<p>“It was extremely negative dealing with James Gelb, and his staff who were all extremely unpleasant people,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he was the main point of contact in communicating with Gelb while living at the residence. He said the texts he received from Gelb were always “abrasive and unnecessarily aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite their negative experiences, both Andersen and Abboud said they never contacted the IVTU, Legal Resource Center or the police about Gelb’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“We figured if we wanted to live on Del Playa, we had to deal with Gelb,” Andersen said. “It’s not surprising to anyone, everyone just expects it out of him.”</p>\n<p>“It seemed futile to deal with Gelb,” Abboud added. “Gelb has a strong monopoly and has no reason to change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1

to sustainability coordinator Katie Maynard. All food grown by the program is collected and donated to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank.</p>\n<p>The program is a partnership between the Sustainability Department, the Food Bank and the Department of Public Worms.</p>\n<p>Rodolfo Herrera, the A.S. Food Bank coordinator, said the program is important in an educational aspect and that the food bank appreciates it, but noted that it grows only a small fraction of his organization’s produce.</p>\n<p>According to the program’s website, the Sustainability Department assists in tasks such as finding and securing funding, the Department of Public Worms does maintenance and harvesting and the Food Bank distributes the produce.</p>\n<p>The program currently grows peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, oranges and cantaloupe, according to Maynard.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Haberlin, the outreach coordinator for the Department of Public Worms, said the produce is collected approximately every three months.</p>\n<p>The Edible Campus Program is currently working on three projects, all of which grow fresh produce to be distributed by the AS Food Bank and educate students about gardening.</p>\n<p>They offer additional educational programming to students including field trips to local farms and workshops, such as their Growing Groceries workshop, and talks on urban gardening.</p>\n<p>The program launched its first project, The Urban Orchard Project, in April 2015.  It was created to grow produce for students in need in underutilized areas.</p>\n<p>The program has planted seven citrus trees in planters located in Storke Plaza since its creation.</p>\n<p>Funding for these trees has come from the Johnson Ohana Foundation, UC President Janet Napolitano’s Global Food Initiative and the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board.</p>\n<p>One was dedicated to the Offices of Enrollment Services and Admissions.</p>\n<p>The program’s second project involving two hydroponic vertical gardens launched in April 2017.</p>\n<p>Located in the Recreation Center, these gardens grow plants without soil, using a mixture of compost tea and commercially-made nutrient mix instead.</p>\n<p>According to the program’s website, they are more water-efficient than soil-based farming.</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will be about 13,000 square feet.  The program’s website specifies it will be located immediately north of the Orfalea Family Children’s Center at West Campus.</p>\n<p>She wrote that funding for the program has come from groups such as the Lawson Valentine Foundation, UC Global Food Initiative, Johnson Ohana Foundation, individual donors, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Student Fee Advisory Committee and the A.S. Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>According to Maynard, the farm was created so the program will be able to grow produce in larger quantities and varieties.</p>\n<p>“We are also excited that the farm enables us to have more educational space where we can host events and workshops for students and the broader community,” she said.</p>\n<p>The representative for the program told the Finance and Business Committee that they also hope to use the farm as a mental health space.</p>\n<p>The Finance and Business Committee funded $10,000 dollars towards the Edible Campus Program’s new student farm at their Oct. 30th meeting.</p>\n<p>One A.S. Senator, Anthony Pimentel, expressed concerns about the funding at this week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>In a statement, he said the money could be used towards keeping the Food Bank open more days.</p>\n<p>He added that there had previously been a similar farm that provided little food to the Food Bank.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the committee will attend the Food Bank’s meeting on Friday to further explain their choice in funding the farm.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

Any member of the public may enter as a judge and taste-testers must vote to taste the baked goods.

Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking for Sunday can email organizers at<em> foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com</em> or look for more information on the Food Not Bombs – Isla Vista Facebook page. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/2084164058538640/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22%5B%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22dashboard%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22suggestion_feed_unit%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22tracking%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22%7B%5C%5C%5C%22qid%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%22%7B%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22suggestion_source%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22browse%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%2C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22suggestion_type%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%2217%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%2C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22browse_session_id%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%2223377d25364d3767c1d3ce26076823c9%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%2C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22session_id%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%226907660802009856264%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%2C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22unique_session_id%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%226907660802009856264%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%2C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22start_cursor%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%22%3A0%7D%5C%5C%5C%22%7D%5C%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%22%7D\">TALK, TOUR AND TASTE AT THE I.V.
