LUX, an event to promote bicycle safety, Wednesday at the Associated Students Pardall Center in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Host organizations included Associate Students Bike Committee (ASBC), Office of Student Affairs, the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Department, the Office of Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr and the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. During the event, 1,500 LED bike lights were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis to local bikers, made possible by funds from ASBC and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Yeh, ASBC Administrative Coordinator and third-year mathematics major, said the LED light giveaway was part of the Bike Committee’s plan to improve UCSB bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to change the bike culture here in I.V. and on campus,” Yeh said. “More specifically, right now, because there are so many accidents at night, we are handing out lights. In conjunction with that, we are giving out a lot of bike safety information and tips.”</p>\n<p>Yeh said ASBC also hopes to improve UCSB’s standing in the League of American Bicyclists’ Annual Bicycle Friendly University awards program, which celebrates universities that have a positive bike culture.</p>\n<p>“The Bike Committee is focused on creating and maintaining bike paths on campus and worrying about bike safety on campus,” Yeh said. “With this event, we are trying to include in our mission an education portion in order to get a [League of American Bicyclists] platinum standing. Platinum ranking is one of our goals this year.”</p>\n<p>Stacy Kowsz, ASBC graduate student representative, said improving bike safety education in the community is one way UCSB can move from gold to platinum level in the League.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we are gold, we want to be platinum. Currently, only a couple universities are platinum, like Stanford and Davis,” Kowsz said. “One of the things we are lacking that the platinum universities have is better education and bike safety. We have tons of people using bikes which is awesome and we do have great bike infrastructure, bikes have a strong presence, but what we don’t have is great bike safety. One of our goals is to improve the culture and make it more safe.”</p>\n<p>Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of student life, said although there are many problems with bike safety in “a lot of different spots,” bike lights are one step toward a safer bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We thought about what we could do that would be positive, so we combined resources with the A.S. Bike Committee and the Dean of Students office to put some funds together to get some bike lights,” Fleming said. “One of the easiest things for people to do is just put a light on your bike at night.”</p>\n<p>According to Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell, the current culture in I.V. is such that cyclists do not feel the need to follow the same laws as cars.<br>\n“A lot of people don’t understand that bicycles are vehicles, and when you’re riding a bicycle, you have to obey the same traffic laws as you would in a car,” McKarrell said. “A lot of the issues we see are people running stop signs and failing to yield to pedestrians. What happens then is we have traffic collisions, mostly either bicyclists-on-bicyclists or bicyclists-on-pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said there is a unique issue with the busy intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, where there is currently a two-way stop sign.</p>\n<p>“The problem with that intersection is there’s free-flowing traffic going east and west and the people traveling north and south have to constantly wait. The bicyclists traveling east and west are within their rights,” McKarrell said. “The only thing I can suggest to be more safe is to not cut behind cars, to maintain a safe speed and to maintain awareness of their surroundings.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said a possible way to improve safety at this locations could be to create a new traffic control device, such as a stoplight or additional stop signs.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be looking at the intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, and we’re going to see if a traffic control device would help cut down on the amount of accidents and the amount of problems we have at that intersection,” Mckarrell said.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, although it may be the busiest intersection, Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte is not the most dangerous intersection in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Believe it or not, as busy as that intersection is, it’s not as problematic as Camino Pescadero and Pardall,” McKarrell said. “I think it’s because there are a lot of blind spots there, and, again, it comes down to people not obeying the traffic signs, and they’ll pull out in front of other bicyclists or cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/","id":4574,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4573,4572,4571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Assessment of I.V.’s Parking Needs","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a meeting Tuesday evening in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss how best to implement a survey to assess parking needs in I.V.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a meeting Tuesday evening in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss how best to implement a survey to assess parking needs in I.V.</p>\n<p>The meeting focused on the types of information that will be needed from the survey to create a viable parking program, including questions pertaining to how long cars are parked and why residents have cars in I.V.

From chains like Starbucks to independent establishments like I.V. Deli, the two-block downtown district in I.V. sustains nearly 50 independently and franchise-owned establishments. As businesses in I.V. begin to outgrow the humble beach town, business owners in I.V. continue to stay afloat.</p>\n<p>“The original concept was called ‘Blunts and Bagels’ and it was gonna be a dispensary bagel shop,” Daniel Dunietz, owner and founder of Buddha Bowls said. Captivated by the beach town’s creative and unique vibes, Dunietz knew he wanted to own and operate his own business in Isla Vista even before he attended UCSB.</p>\n<p>In December of 2013, Dunietz opened the doors to Buddha Bowls. The restaurant is a testament to his desire to make people happy through unique and satisfying food and was first opened under the expectation that marijuana would soon be legalized. Dunietz said he intends to incorporate marijuana into his business as soon as it becomes legalized, but said “up until now, all we can really do is help get signatures, help get measures through, help rally the students and really try to bring awareness to the importance of voting in the next election cycle.”</p>\n<p>While Dunietz has larger political ambitions in mind, he and other Isla Vista business owners are focused on the more immediate challenges of running a successful business in the community.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Downtown Business Owners Association was formed in 2015 to market I.V., protect businesses and deal with problems of parking and safety. The college-town atmosphere of Isla Vista makes working in the beach haven both social and engaging, but the isolated location suffers from a constantly increasing flow of students, high population density and the effects of a thriving party scene.</p>\n<p>“The sheer number of young people here, the energy, it’s a place that can really embrace something unique and different,” Dunietz said.  “It’s not somewhere that you have people that are set in their way, they’re new, they’re molding,” Dunietz said. The progressive ideologies and creative personalities of many students make I.V. a “perfect” place to operate a restaurant.</p>\n<p>Andrea Maasz, manager of Otaco, said there are sometimes issues with rowdy customers, but I.V. is one of the best places she has worked. According to Maasz, when planning for the opening of the restaurant, Otaco’s interior designers had to take into account the energy of I.V. customers and the “potential for mayhem” in the small area.</p>\n<p>“All our furniture is plywood because people will dance up on there. We’ve broken the stage last week and the music’s pretty loud, but overall it’s a lot of fun,” Maasz said. “People understand if something bad happens, and people are a lot of fun on the Wednesday karaoke nights; it gets crazy.”</p>\n<p>Al Espino, owner of organic hemp product store Hempwise, said he enjoys the constant influx of new people in I.V. because it creates an “ever-changing population.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve been in I.V. for 20 years; there’s a good and bad I guess.” Espino said. “It’s kind of like moving and getting a new location every few years.”<br>\nRico Ochoa Suave, manager of Pizza My Heart, said he has “seen it all” when serving I.V. customers, and appreciates the town as a lively environment for business.</p>\n<p>“It can get a little bit hectic maybe with alcohol, but it’s always a great place to be,” Suave said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68392\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68392\" data-attachment-id=\"68392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/businesses_-by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Businesses_ by Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68392\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=750%2C497\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pizza My Heart employees must be prepared to handle situations involving intoxicated customers, but Suave said customers rarely need to be kicked out.</p>\n<p>Virtually all businesses in I.V. are squeezed into a few “downtown” blocks, stretching from 65 Pardall to 65 Trigo. The area is commonly packed with students commuting to and from campus and the congested area offers few options for parking. Beginning in 2015, I.V. stakeholders started holding weekly meetings to discuss solutions for more efficient traffic in the area.</p>\n<p>Jacob Bergam, manager of Bagel Café, said careless pedestrians and bikers and “horrible” parking create an unappealing shopping environment in I.V.<br>\n“As a result most non locals avoid making the trek to Isla Vista business,” Bergam said in an email.</p>\n<p>Marissa Bragstad, Isla Vista Food Co-op floor manager and outreach assistant, said non-student residents shop at the Co-op, but some of them may be “put off” from its location in Isla Vista, which is drastically different than the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara areas.</p>\n<p>“We do have some shoppers that have been shopping with us for over thirty years since the Co-op first started,” Bragstad said. “But sometimes it’s hard to maintain those customers since it is a different shopping experience from if you’re going out in Goleta or downtown Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>The majority of I.V.’s population flows in and out as college graduates move out of town to make place for incoming freshman. Due to the transient nature of I.V.’s residents, businesses are hard-pressed to retain customers and appeal to new residents.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Food Co-op, which first opened in 1972, has in recent years begun several programs to support I.V. and encourage community participation.</p>\n<p>“You may have a customer that shops here from their sophomore year to their senior year and then they go,” Bragstad said. “So we’re constantly trying to make people aware that we’re here.”</p>\n<p>Woodstocks General Manager James Glover said another downside of I.V.’s transient environment is the need to constantly rehire employees.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of long-standing folk. It sucks, you develop people, they turn into these badass adults and then fly off and do amazing things,” Glover said. “So it’s cool that that’s the case but it also sucks that you have to get rid of your best people sometimes, just out of the nature of being in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to fifth-year math major Donald Heatherington, the increase in chain businesses was inevitable because smaller businesses have difficulty surviving in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It’s gone from smaller, family-owned businesses to larger chains. I’ve seen a lot of businesses fail in I.V. or maybe only stay for a couple of months,” Heatherington said. “The economic climate and student schedules and tastes are pretty unpredictable, so it kind of makes sense.”</p>\n<p>Hempwise owner Espino said student traffic, which is highly dependent on the university schedule, creates a difficult business pattern.</p>\n<p>“The bad is there is a lot of downtime with all the holidays; it’s pretty much kind of stuck to the school schedule, so during any holidays it’s real quiet; during finals and test times, it’s quiet,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Espino said Hempwise does not have as large as an advertising budget as other businesses, and instead relies on more inexpensive, “less mainstream” forms of promotion.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have tried to focus more on more grassroots promotion like flyers and handouts, you know, word of mouth and things like that as opposed to other years where we would do more blanket advertising through the Independent and even the Daily Nexus, which we’re not really doing so much anymore,” Espino said.<br>\nDunietz said he has not changed his business model since he opened because his business has been successful despite changes in I.V.’s environment and increased competition.</p>\n<p>“There could be a hundred new restaurants opened up and I still feel I could succeed because if you do the right thing and you attract the right kind of customers, you’ll be all right,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Check out the Daily Nexus next week for the second part of our series dedicated to Isla Vista businesses.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 in the Thursday, Friday 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/","id":4571,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[4570,4569,4568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CC Library Brings Resources to I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Library_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Library_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Library is sponsoring a librarian outreach service at the Isla Vista (I.V.)

Pardall Center to help SBCC students and I.V. community members receive library services close to home.</p>\n<p>The outreach program is designed to provide SBCC students who live in I.V. with easier access to the campus library’s resources. SBCC Mobile Librarian Kristen LaBonte will be available Wednesday nights in the Pardall Center from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to provide locals with services such as research and homework assistance.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said she will be available to help students with a wide range of assistance services.</p>\n<p>“I help out with technology questions, research relating to term papers, personal research that people are doing, general questions and technical things like people’s personal devices,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>Although the program’s main objective is to provide resources for local SBCC students, LaBonte said she is happy to help anyone who stops by.</p>\n<p>“I help everyone. I don’t ask for anyone’s affiliation. That’s actually common practice with libraries,” LaBonte said. “We don’t discriminate; we are open to everybody.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Library Director Elizabeth Bowman explained the reasoning behind the new service.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students live in Isla Vista and struggle with bus availability or don’t have a car or, for whatever reason, want to stay here in I.V.,” Bowman said. “We do have online resources, which are great, but to have someone here for an extended time who can offer extensive help is invaluable. Students have told us that they like our library and our hours, but they like to stay here [in Isla Vista].”</p>\n<p>Ethan Bertrand, SBCC Associated Students Isla Vista community representative (IVCR), said the project is the result of collaboration with the Pardall Center and UCSB Associated Students leadership.</p>\n<p>“Within our student government last year, we saw a need for services in Isla Vista, so we created the IVCR position,” Bertrand said. “This is one of my roles with that, to work to support City College interests in the community and support students.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the news of the project’s launch has been well received.</p>\n<p>“So far we’ve heard a lot of great things. This originated due to feedback from students. This event is us saying we’re here and to please come use our services,” Bertrand said. “I think the greatest part about it is it’s not just for City College students, it’s also for the whole community, whether it’s UCSB students, longtime community members or families.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, SBCC trustee, said he helped coordinate the project by using the knowledge and connections he made as a former Associated Students (A.S.) President at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I coordinated this space. I was A.S. President, so I had connections and knowledge of Associated Students. So I brought both together, both my involvement with SBCC and my past involvement in A.S.,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he thinks the new service will serve I.V.’s SBCC population well and hopes it will expand to include more services for SBCC students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we’re providing services for SBCC students. There are about 3,000 [SBCC] students living in I.V., and they do need services. SBCC is far and it’s not feasible for students to make it over there all the time,” Abboud said. “I hope that this, in the future, expands to include more than library services like transfer services and financial aid services.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on pages 1,7 in the Thursday, Friday 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/","id":4569,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4568,4567,4566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The country promised reconstruction of sidewalks on Sabado Tarde and Del Playa but specific details of when and which sections of the sidewalk will be rebuilt have yet to be disclosed. Lighting in I.V. has been limited due to SB Ordinance 5035, which aims to prevent light pollution in parks, viewed by some as a safety hazard. Attendees also discussed replanting the trees removed years ago in front of I.V. Theater and adding gutters to ease the street flooding during rainy weather.</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Andrew Pragin said the removal of trees surrounding I.V. Theater made him realize the important role they played in the surrounding environment.</p>\n<p>“I never really realized how significant that tree removal was until I saw the pictures,” Pragin said. “It’s incredible how much shade and greenery they provided.”</p>\n<p>LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Program and 31-year resident, said the county only permits certain species of trees in the area that match the surrounding ecology.</p>\n<p>“There is an approved list of trees from the county that you can plant,” Miller said. “Ficus I don’t believe is on it. Flowering pears are, however. Those are the ones that are blooming white allover right now.”</p>\n<p>Ken Masuda, volunteer with Assemblymember Das Williams’s office, said I.V. should consider trimming some of the trees because they block street illumination.</p>\n<p>“There are places in I.V. where the street light, which is supposed to illuminate the street and sidewalk, is not getting there because of branches and leaves in the way,” Masuda said. “So I think if we’re going to have a tree program there would be two aspects: tree planting and tree trimming.”</p>\n<p>Miller said I.V. parks and streets are not well lit, which can lead to increased crime.</p>\n<p>“During the winter we have less participation in the ESL [English as a Second Language] classes in the evening at I.V. school because there is not a safe passageway from where students live to get to the elementary school,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Professor of art Kim Yasuda said the need for lighting can be remedied with blue LED lights in dimly lit areas as a permanent version of the Blunite memorial art instalment that took place last spring to memorialize the events of May 23, 2014. This form of lighting would be less obstructive to the surrounding environment, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“We have Blue Light organized by students who are planning for a community illumination effort,” Yasuda said. “The larger commission could make it long term.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, Field Representative for Williams’s office, said reconstructing sidewalks will provide pedestrians a safer alternative to walking on streets.</p>\n<p>“It is a lot better for liability and safety purposes, especially public safety, to be able to say there are sidewalks on the streets even if they are not being actually utilized,” Schunk said. “This is the logic for governance.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/","id":4570,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4569,4568,4567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"District Supervisor Candidates Share Platforms","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor candidates spoke with the Nexus this week to share their platforms for Isla Vista and the county.

He currently works as president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition and Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Porter announced in late January his plan to initiate an Economic Prosperity Corridor should he be elected as supervisor. According to Porter, most of the tech firms in Santa Barbara County are located in Goleta, which he said forces workers to commute on the 101 from their homes in the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“As I’ve met with officials at UCSB, I’ve learned of a wave of new companies and new technologies that will be spinning out of research at UCSB, and in the past a lot of those just went into Goleta,” Porter said. “Goleta is pretty well built-out now.”</p>\n<p>His plan with the Economic Prosperity Corridor is to encourage businesses to “set up shop” in areas like Buellton, Lompoc and Santa Maria to reduce the number of freeway commuters. According to Porter, this initiative will help to reduce pollution, preserve infrastructure and allow UCSB grads to stay in the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Let’s move those new businesses out into other parts of the county where they’ll be closer to the people who actually work there,” Porter said. “That would be keeping all these great businesses in the county.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V., Porter said he hopes to be a leader and a “champion” for getting the Community Services District (CSD) proposal passed in November. He said the ultimate goal for I.V. is cityhood.</p>\n<p>“In the long range, the goal is cityhood for Isla Vista, if that’s what the residents want. The CSD is sort of a tiny little step to that eventual goal,” Porter said. “[I want to help] shape the whole process over time so that we continue the path to full cityhood.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68106\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68106\" data-attachment-id=\"68106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-joan-hartmann-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Joan Hartmann\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68106 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=296%2C431\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org\" width=\"296\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Planning Commissioner Joan Hartmann declared candidacy in early January in hopes to “continue and build on” the role of her soon-to-retire employer, Farr.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s career began in academia when she earned a Ph.D. in Government from Claremont Graduate School, where she was appointed as the first female faculty member and director of the Public Policy Program. She also served on the faculty at Oberlin College and later served as adjunct professor at USC. She currently serves on the Santa Barbara Foundation’s LEAF Advisory Committee and the Wilding Museum’s Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>According to Hartmann, the platform of her bid for supervisor is “enhancing the quality of life that we cherish in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen Farr has done a really good job connecting people to county resources, and her staff has worked hard to provide good, strong constituency services,” Hartmann said. “I would like to build on that.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said one of the issues she hopes to address is economic vitality in the county. She said she hopes to increase cooperation between the private and public sectors, following the models laid out by Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County and Sonoma County.</p>\n<p>“The question is, ‘What do we want in Santa Barbara County?’” Hartmann said. “I would like the county to help bring the various entities together and hear that out in a more deliberate way.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V. and the University, Hartmann said she wants to take on a similar role as Farr in regularly meeting with residents and university officials.</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen and her staff have worked very hard to participate in the various working groups and committees in Isla Vista, and I would certainly continue that,” Hartmann said. “I know she also meets regularly with UCSB representatives and tries to find ways that they can work together on issues. I would want to continue that and build on it.”</p>\n<p>Should I.V. residents approve a CSD in November, Hartmann said she would be supportive but yielding to the needs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“If there is a CSD, I think that is something I would support,” Hartmann said. “As a supervisor, I think it’s really something that is controlled largely by the community. I think that’s the whole point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68105\" style=\"width: 323px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68105\" data-attachment-id=\"68105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-jay-freeman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Jay Freeman-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68105 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=313%2C456\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac\" width=\"313\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac</p></div>\n<p>Sixteen-year I.V. resident Jay Freeman declared candidacy late January in order to fill a role where he said he seems to be needed.</p>\n<p>Freeman grew up in Chicago and came to UCSB in 1999 to study computer science. He is the founder of the multimillion-dollar software company Cydia, an app that allows users to customize jailbroken Apple devices. Freeman currently serves as vice president of the Isla Vista Downtown Business Association and is an active member of the Isla Vista Self-Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>As for Freeman’s involvement in the supervisor race, Freeman said he has “kind of fallen into this” — he believes the county’s board of supervisors is a place that has shown a need for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a career politician in the sense that I want to rise through the ranks,” Freeman said. “I want essentially to be the man in the field who’s actually trying to figure out how to make practical solutions to real world problems, as opposed to sitting back and doing legislation.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the county needs to be more proactive in serving its residents.<br>\n“The county just allows problems to occur, then waits for people to complain about them and then tries to quell the uprising,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said one of the issues he hopes to address as supervisor is the lack of interaction between I.V. residents and county officials. According to Freeman, it is inadequate that state assemblymember Das Williams has had to host meetings to foster communication between I.V. and the county.</p>\n<p>“It’s slightly awkward that we’ve had to have our state assemblymember run meetings that are almost mediating between the people of Isla Vista and the county,” Freeman said. “That’s the kind of meeting that I would have expected that the county would have been setting up.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he wants to be a county supervisor that is actively involved in local meetings in the county’s unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“I actually want to try to sit down in various local meetings and try to come up with compromises between bringing people together,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V. cannot attain the full benefits of a CSD unless the county “steps up” and institutes a Municipal Advisory Council or an Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“With a Community Services District, one of the powers that it can have is to fund a Municipal Advisory Council, but it doesn’t have the power to make a Municipal Advisory Council,” Freeman said. “The county has to support that.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/","id":4575,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4574,4573,4572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Suspect Increase in Bike Citations","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tickets_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tickets_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Ricky Waltman was biking to work early Tuesday morning when he approached a stop sign at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road.

A California Highway Patrol car was parked on the side of the street, but Waltman didn’t think twice about breezing through the intersection on his bicycle.</p>\n<p>“There were no cars on the road and it was 9 a.m.,” said Waltman, a UCSB alumnus. “I slowed down and didn’t stop. I’ve done that plenty of times in front of a cop.”</p>\n<p>Moments later, the patrol car’s lights flashed on and an officer cited Waltman for failing to stop — a $270 fine for the first offense, according to the Santa Barbara Police Department.</p>\n<p>“‘We are cracking down on it to hopefully make you guys more safe,’” Waltman recalled the officer saying. As Waltman pedaled away from the curb, he saw the officer pull over another bicyclist for running the same stop sign.</p>\n<p>While Waltman and other Isla Vistans say there has been an increase in citations for bike offenses, Officer John Gutierrez of the Santa Barbara Police Department said there is no effort by highway patrol officers to write more tickets.</p>\n<p>“We’re not told to go out there and write up bicyclists — not at all,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>The police department will be hosting a bike safety event on March 2 at the Pardall Center, after which, Gutierrez said, there may be a “ramped up increase” in citations.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez pointed to recent bike accidents in I.V., including a two-bike collision on Pardall Road <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/692109191822049280\">in January</a> that sent one person to the hospital, as evidence of the need for bicyclists to follow traffic signs.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are riding bicycles unsafely in I.V.,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night, Associated Students senators voted to send a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bike-Law-Resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> resolution</a> to External Affairs Committee that calls on campus police, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol “to allow bicycles to treat stop signs and red lights as yield signs.” The resolution will now head to A.S. External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jerel Constantino, who drafted the bill, said because so many students already ignore the bike laws, the bill is designed “to keep the status quo.”</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, third-year history of public policy major and College of Letters &amp; Sciences collegiate senator, said Isla Vista Foot Patrol regulates bicycle and skateboard laws inconsistently.</p>\n<p>“The crackdown on bicyclists is unreasonable, because I.V.F.P. will be very strict on biking rules . . . and then will disappear,” Minoiefar said. “I don’t think the crackdown is about safety, because the rules are not enforced consistently.”</p>\n<p>The resolution refers to a 1982 Idaho statute known as the “Idaho stop,” which allows bicyclists to roll through stop signs, after looking both ways, and to bike under red lights after stopping.</p>\n<p>“The Idaho stop is not saying you see a stop sign and you ignore it,” Constantino said. “When you see a stop sign, that should be a key to look both left and right and, if necessary, stop.”</p>\n<p>Constantino, third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he bikes to campus from I.V. every day and drafted the bill to protect bicyclists “from a misguided prioritization of law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls for the California State Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to institute a similar law statewide.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Waltman was cited, he posted a picture of his ticket on a popular UCSB Facebook group, warning other bicyclists that officers were enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was at the center of a spirited debate in the comment section about whether police should ticket bicyclists for failing to obey traffic signs.</p>\n<p>While some commenters assumed Waltman disagreed with being cited, he said he “totally deserved” the ticket.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s a little inconvenient to stop and go on a rusty old mountain bike, but when you have a culture where nobody stops and people just throw themselves into intersections, it’s dangerous,” Waltman said.</p>\n<p>Elena Rovito, fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she often bikes to class and to restaurants in I.V. Rovito said she always follows the traffic signs, but when she walks, she has to be aware of bicyclists who are not following the law.</p>\n<p>“You have to constantly be on your toes,” Rovito said. “You’ll see people biking, not looking both ways, texting, and I’ve had to jump out of the way on more than one occasion.”</p>\n<p>Sarah Garrett, first-year political science major and copy reader at the Daily Nexus, was ticketed recently for failing to stop at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Road. Garrett said she plans to enroll in a bike safety course to reduce her fine.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think anything of it because, a couple days before, I had blown through a stop sign by a cop and nothing had happened,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>The officer told Garrett that he was trying to keep her and other bicyclists safe, but she said stopping at some intersections can be more dangerous than passing slowly through.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be more of a hazard to stop at certain stop signs because no one is stopping and I feel like herds of bikes might run over me,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>Garrett now tries to avoid biking through I.V. by staying on El Colegio Road for as long as possible. When she has to bike through I.V., though, she said she stops at every stop sign to avoid another ticket — or at least slows down and puts her foot on the ground.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this story said the bike resolution had passed Student Senate.

Clinic building to discuss potential forms of tenant mediation in I.V. if it becomes a Community Services District (CSD) in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>The group met with Andrea Bifano, representative of the Community Development Department Rental Housing Mediation of Santa Barbara County, to discuss further plans for mediation. UCSB students, who have access to mediation through the University, are currently the only I.V. residents with such services.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, who is running for Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor, stakeholders should consider the fact that UCSB students already have free mediation at their disposal.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tax money people are paying is to go towards this service that they are also getting from somewhere else,” Freeman said. “I don’t think we should fully discount them. The board will make a decision on who they want to serve. UCSB is not running this government.”</p>\n<p>Carlos Lopez, fourth-year anthropology major and A.S. Lobby Corps director, said he is interested in a new mediation program that would educate renters on how to communicate with landlords about property maintenance.</p>\n<p>“I think the ability to inform students on what their rights are when living in a house is good,” Lopez said. “There have been only a few situations when something might be going on in your house and you’re not sure if it’s your job or your landlord’s job to fix. For a lot of students who are only going to be living there for a year, it’s kind of easier to put up with it for a year.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said it is important for renters to uphold open communication with their landlords about what to do if a property needs maintenance.</p>\n<p>“Even in my house there was something wrong with our fence and one of our neighbors was talking about how when they called the landlord they got a way different response than when they went online to deal with the problem,” Lopez said. “So it’s good to establish some level of consistency in treatment on issues for tenants and the things that happen.”</p>\n<p>Audrey Tamayo, a member of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and third-year political science major, said the University mediation program does not always take into account the point of view of everyone in tenant-landlord mediations.</p>\n<p>“From my accounts with people that I know, the University’s program has not been as effective as they should,” Tamayo said. “Some of the problems include mediators twisting the words a bit, so in one instance where my friend and her roommate were having an argument and one of the tenants had pushed her up against the balcony, the mediator rephrased it as a push-shove fight. That implies a mutual kind of pushing and shoving, [but] it was only one tenant who was pushing.”</p>\n<p>According to Tamayo, many tenants, including her own housemates, fear going to the University for help with mediation because they believe it will end in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“I guess they are kind of scared in a way, since others are always saying that they’re going to sue you if you go do this,” Tamayo said.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus, said he appreciates that the program will provide safety for many tenants who oftentimes end up experiencing difficulty with legality.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate hearing the fact that it ultimately can result in a legally binding contract or document,” Abboud said. “A lot of the times, dealing with landlords and property managers, you might come up with a spoken agreement, but when it comes time to resolve it, there’s another thing that ends up happening.”</p>\n<p>The task force of mediators would be neutral between tenants and landlords, with discussions of creating workshops where all parties could come together to receive education on renting in I.V. The proposed tenant mediation would be incorporated into the eight percent Utility User’s Tax, which will be on the November 2016 ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Businesses are worried that they will be negatively impacted by power outages due to their forced closures. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista business owners and managers shared their experiences with the Nexus this week regarding the recent power outages amidst stormy weather in the Goleta area.</p>\n<p>Many local businesses have reported losing all electricity with the onset of El Niño storms. On Jan. 5, for example, strong winds damaged infrastructure and caused a power outage throughout I.V.’s downtown business district that lasted several hours, and smaller power outages have followed. In such circumstances, many businesses report having to close stores until power is restored.</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen said the co-op lost at least half of its sales on Jan. 5 as the result of a power outage that rendered the store closed for five hours. According to Cohen, the store averages about $10,000 a day in sales, but it only made about $5,000 on Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>“It’s very hard to have to sit at the entrance of your business and say, ‘Sorry there’s no power,’” Cohen said. “That was stressful and our sales that day really suffered.”</p>\n<p>Otaco manager and third-year sociology student Richard Kim said the restaurant loses money during power outages, especially when the blackouts occur at night.</p>\n<p>“It does affect our numbers because we sell beer and beer sells better at night,” Kim said. “It hurts financially.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Drip owner Tom Leu, however, the power outage saved his restaurant money because business was already slow during recent storms and the loss of power allowed him to send employees home.</p>\n<p>“That was a perfect time for a power outage,” Leu said.</p>\n<p>Aladdin Café employee Steven Abdulhai, whose family owns the restaurant, said his family will usually check in with their neighboring restaurant Woodstock’s Pizza to determine whether or not to close during power outages.</p>\n<p>“We like to keep ourselves updated with Woodstock’s — we’re cool with the employees there,” Abdulhai said. “If it’s not too serious for them to be closing, then we’ll probably stay open.”</p>\n<p>Buddha Bowls owner Daniel Dunietz said the “real issue” with power outages is maintaining food temperatures. According to Dunietz, the loss of power shuts down refrigeration, which can cause food to spoil over a certain period of time.</p>\n<p>“There is a fair amount of built-in insulation, but we still watch those temperatures slowly rise,” Dunietz said. “Once it gets past a certain point, [the food] becomes dangerous, and if it stays at that point for some time, you have to throw out everything.”</p>\n<p>Dunietz said he instructs his employees to keep the coolers closed to preserve the cool air inside in case of outages.</p>\n<p>“We have a protocol where you just don’t open the cooler, because it is insulated so it can keep that temperature cool for almost six to eight hours,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Dunietz said Southern California Edison has usually had a quick response time to damaged infrastructure during storms.</p>\n<p>“The guys at Edison have been really awesome, so I’ve been giving them coupons and stuff,” Dunietz said. “They bust their ass.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, power outages have some positive results.</p>\n<p>“The beauty of those power outage days is that celebration when the power goes back on,” Cohen said. “We can invite our people back into our store.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/","id":4587,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4586,4585,4584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The UUT would provide $512,000 for services in I.V., ranging from administrative positions to a parking plan.</p>\n<p>The CSD administration is expected to receive an estimated $257,000 from the budget. This will include an IVCSD general manager to oversee public engagements and contracts for services, as well as the implantation of programs decided by the board of directors.</p>\n<p>Lanny Ebenstein, UCSB professor of economics, said he was unsure if the general manager would be a part-time position.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if there is going to be basically one full-time person, because the clerical is part-time and the transaction is part-time, and the recourse development person is part-time,” Ebenstein said.</p>\n<p>The general manager would have a salary of $162,500 and a part time clerical staff would receive compensation of $31,250 and other office expenses.</p>\n<p>Ebenstein said the salary of the general manager would be too costly for the budget.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure if that is the amount required to get someone to fill the responsibilities of the general manager of IVCSD,” Ebenstein said. “I think that is something that merits further consideration … there might be other comparable positions in I.V. I think the figure is too high given the budget.”</p>\n<p>LuAnn Miller, the Executive Director of Isla Vista Youth Projects, said an eight percent tax could be a concern for voters, especially with the addition of a new administrative position.</p>\n<p>“I wonder about any intentional kickback from voters who are going to be looking at this and say, ‘You’re asking us to add this utility tax and part of it would go to administration. I won’t be voting on that,’” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Ken Masuda, a volunteer with Assemblymember Das Williams’s office, said the $30,000 allotted for improved I.V. parking will benefit current and future residents because it will present a new plan based on the size of groups of individuals who park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think the parking study we want is going to be a little different in the sense that when we were discussing parking, we made a list of groups we wanted to have parking and a list of groups we want to discourage from parking,” Masuda said. “But we don’t know anything about the size of any of those groups.”</p>\n<p>According to Masuda, understanding the sizes of the different groups of people who park in I.V. would be useful for the Community Service District (CSD) in planning better parking.</p>\n<p>“One thing [that] would be helpful for the CSD-sponsored parking study is to try to get at what are the sizes of those different groups,” Masuda said. “And so in that way, the cost of the study could be more when you’re trying to get that level of detail.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office, said visual changes in the community would show taxpayer money directly at work.</p>\n<p>“Sidewalks, lighting, and trees are some of the most immediately visual impacting things you see in a community, and it may serve the CSD well to be able to do small projects that have striking visual impact,” Schunk said. “That way, people associate that with the work the district is doing.”</p>\n<p>The other services in the budget amounted to $204,000. The Community Service District (CSD) would support tenant mediation as well as community Facility Recourse Development, which includes community health and economic development programs.</p>\n<p>The proposal must be finalized within a month to be presented to the LAFCO. After an application has been accepted, a hearing will be scheduled within 90 days.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

to raise money for solar panels for the Isla Vista Food Co-op as part of their goal to improve sustainability in the community.</p>\n<p>The Solar Ambassadors program is a college-campus extension of the San Francisco based nonprofit, RE-volv. Students from different colleges and universities annually organize, develop and fundraise for a solar energy project in their communities. UCSB’s chapter is gaining momentum this year and plans to run its crowdfunding campaign for at least six weeks.</p>\n<p>Project leader and third-year environmental studies major Kaylan Lamb said she became involved with Solar Ambassadors when a professor of a class she took last year encouraged students to apply.</p>\n<p>“We had an email from our professor to get interests together, and then we made up a team and applied,” Lamb said. “And you have to sign a local nonprofit or cooperative that owns their own building and that could potentially get solar panels on their building.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said the Solar Ambassadors program only works with nonprofits and cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“It’s only nonprofits and co-ops because they usually don’t have the type of funds and can’t get the type of financing in order to afford solar on their own, so that’s where we come in,” Lamb said. “We decided on the I.V. Food Co-op because they’re really interested and had just gotten a new roof installed. It’s perfect timing.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said there there will be a launch event for the campaign in early February at the Co-op.</p>\n<p>“We have a few events planned,” Lamb said. “One of them is the launch event that will be held at the Co-op to get the word out to the community and target the student population that comes in and out of the Co-op as well as the adult population that also shops there.”</p>\n<p>Team member and fourth-year environmental science major Ingrid Medina said the project will help educate the community on the positive impact of solar energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s really good to show people that it’s possible to be sustainable and also promote renewable energy,” Medina said. “We want to educate on how much of an impact it’s going to make.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Olivia Godfrey said she is happy to be part of the Solar Ambassadors team because of its promotion of community-wide sustainability.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to get involved with a project of this scale because it’s promoting sustainability in a way that’s pretty attainable for both students and the community,” Godfrey said. “I feel like a lot of people get the sense that solar is more like a private thing … but this project really goes to show that it can be a group effort to make something big happen.”</p>\n<p>Co-op General Manager Melissa Cohen said the project is not only about increasing solar energy use, but also about members of the community coming together to affect change.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about the panels, which are an obviously great addition to our store,” Cohen said. “The method by which RE-volv makes their projects happen is directly in line with our people-powered, community-owned grocery store.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, the project will succeed if the community comes together to support the cause of clean energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s totally based in people believing in the project and helping steward it into existence,” Cohen said. “This is how movements begin, and how communities can become more and more healthy as people being to see that they’re part of something bigger than themselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared

Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista, Tuesday evening in the I.V. Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Participants discussed the use of a $126,000 budget for committees and services outlined in Das William’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to make I.V., currently an unincorporated area, into a CSD. The selected services, which will be aided by a $200,000 pledge by UCSB after the CSD is created, will be sent to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for approval and placed on the 2016 ballot for voters to a decide on an eight percent utility users tax. The services to be sent to LAFCO are the Municipal Advisory Council, the Tenant Mediation Program, the Area Planning Commission, a parking district, police protection services, community facilities, sidewalks, lighting, gutters, trees and graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>George Thurlow, Alumni Affairs Office assistant vice chancellor, said although the pledged funds will not be available until after the CSD is created, it should still be included in the report to LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion would be that you come up with a wish list for two years, 2017 and 2018, a $200,000 budget for each one and decide which projects and programs you want to fund,” Thurlow said. “Put that in front of LAFCO because they’re going to be criticizing [that] it’s not enough money or good enough services.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus, said the term “police protection services” should be defined before deciding on an alternative community policing program that would cost $75,000.</p>\n<p>“To me, it could be contracting law enforcement to host a few self-defense classes every quarter,” Schunk said. “That to me is contracting for additional law enforcement services and that activates that power just fine, and we also have a contract.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said contracting more law enforcement officers from Santa Barbara County or UC Police Department (UCPD) would “tie” the CSD to the police collaborative board.</p>\n<p>“I just wonder whether or not contracting with them is getting actual on-the-job police services or contracting something small like liaison work,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Pargin, second-year math major, said it would be more beneficial to get additional police services from UCPD because it would come out of the university’s budget instead of the CSD’s budget.</p>\n<p>The collaborative program is based on the S.N.A.P. program at Cal Poly which hires students to be first responders and provide campus warnings. Since the university does not want to expand the CSO program into I.V., the contracting cadets would not be UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliot, community organizer from Das Williams’ office, said the CSD could replicate S.N.A.P., but will not be an extension of the program.</p>\n<p>“They could work with student groups with whatever project they’re working on,” Elliot said. “These cadets do not carry weapons and are in training to eventually become officers. It would be better because they would learn to respond without weapons and have training that didn’t incorporate immediate arresting.”</p>\n<p>Jonathon Abboud, Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus, said it would be best to fund as many services as possible through LAFCO’s approval and distribute $200,000 in UCSB pledge funds afterwards.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually better and more effective in the long term with the money we have instead of spreading the budget out way too thin where you couldn’t do that much per year,” Abboud said. “I think it’s a much more prudent approach to LAFCO where you’ve already thought of eight percent.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/","id":4581,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4580,4579,4578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria To Reopen","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.</p>\n<p>According to the Babais, Gio’s closed temporarily to allow the new owners to transfer business and alcohol permits back to the location from previous owner Matt Metzka. The Babais have been doing restoration work inside the restaurant and will be opening the restaurant tomorrow at 11 p.m. as “Founders Family” Giovanni’s Pizza Isla Vista, with a grand opening from January 29 to 31.</p>\n<p>Debra Babai said the staff will remain the same as it was before the temporary closing, but the new managers will be Indres Govender and Carrie Leonard. Danny Babai said the ownership change was due to confidential reasons.</p>\n<p>“We took it back from the franchisee — it was confidential but we had to get it back,” Danny Babai said. “We hired back all the people who used to work here.”</p>\n<p>Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza has operated in the Santa Barbara area since 1979. According to a statement from the Babais, Danny Babai opened the first Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza on State Street in 1979 and continues overseeing the business. Garrett Gruendyke, one of Danny’s sons, has owned and run an additional location, Giovanni’s Pizza on the Mesa, since 2009.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/","id":4580,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4579,4578,4577],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":20,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
