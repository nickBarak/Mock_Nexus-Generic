The project aims to make Isla Vista and its roads more pedestrian-friendly. <em>Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.</p>\n<p>According to Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, the county will add more sidewalks on the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road. Curb ramps will be placed in several intersections along Sueno Road.</p>\n<p>Residents of these parts of Sabado Tarde Road will not have to wait long for the completion of this project. McGolpin projects it will be underway in the beginning of this spring, and he estimates construction will take approximately three months.</p>\n<p>This project, which bears a cost of $750,000, is being funded equally by the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UC Santa Barbara. Each is allocating $2 million for this project and similar public works projects in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>According to George Thurlow, UCSB special assistant for Isla Vista affairs, the project is part of the “joint county-university” safety improvements in Isla Vista. He said the University has pledged $2 million over the next 10 years to be matched by the county for sidewalks, streetlights and traffic improvements.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to have sidewalks on at least one side of all the streets in Isla Vista,” he said.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of an effort by the Santa Barbara Public Works Department to make Isla Vista more pedestrian-friendly. It was preceded by sidewalk installment projects on Del Playa Drive and Sueno Road throughout the last several years.</p>\n<p>“The community originally didn’t have sidewalks,” McGolpin said. “It takes time and money, and we’re slowly chipping away at it.”</p>\n<p>As of now, continuous sidewalks are sparse in Isla Vista. The county installed a long stretch of sidewalks along Del Playa Drive in 2002, and other streets have received segments of sidewalks over the following years. There are still many blocks in Isla Vista that do not have a consistent stretch of sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Normally in California the way sidewalks get constructed is when you have an area that is going to be developed, you decide you want sidewalks and then you require developers to provide a sidewalk in front of their section of land,” said Jay Freeman, an 18-year Isla Vista resident and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the case during the development of Isla Vista. Although certain houses in the designated area of Sabado Tarde Road already have a sidewalk in front of them, they were installed during housing redevelopment.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the project seeks to change this so that every house on these blocks has a sidewalk without having to redevelop properties.</p>\n<p>Another motive for this sidewalk project is to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In recent years, long-time Isla Vista residents have advocated for easier wheelchair access throughout the town, a large reason for the increase in sidewalks and curb ramps.</p>\n<p>These projects will have a focus on public and safety improvements, as well as “traffic-calming”<br>\nmeasures.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/","id":4455,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[4454,4453,4452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tax Proposed To Fund I.V.

With approximately 8,377 bedrooms and 215,862 square feet of commercial space in Isla Vista, IVRPD officials estimate the special tax could add $256,348.43 in annual tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, IVRPD will levy the tax for the next 10 years after June 2017. Registered voters will receive mail-in ballots 29 days before May 9, and the measure must attain a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>Property owners currently pay an annual rate of approximately $93 in special taxes. IVRPD runs on a $1.5 million budget.</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, IVRPD general manager, said the additional special taxes could help pay for more park services, especially since the measure directs at least 50 percent of the tax revenue for capital improvements. He said IVRPD will then be able to address the “backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board Chair Pegeen Soutar said she hopes the increase in funds could bring reclaimed water into I.V. through a contract with the Goleta West Sanitary District.</p>\n<p>Soutar first proposed the special tax measure in February 2016 in light of two key factors.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District proposed in April 2015 to proportionally raise water rates by drought level. According to Soutar, this means a $30,000 water bill would increase to $60,000.</p>\n<p>IVRPD officials also foresaw a decrease in tax revenue after the university purchased Tropicana Gardens in July 2015, an Isla Vista residence hall previously owned by a Chicago investor. UCSB is exempt from paying taxes for the property that it owns in I.V. due to state law.</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in tax revenue, however, the university reached an agreement in which it pays IVRPD the amount lost in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, Isla Vista property owners will be paying the same amount on property taxes as in the 2015-16 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>As of now, property owners pay less on property taxes for the 2016-17 fiscal year because of a land ownership bond that ended in June 2016, paid back like a loan. IVRPD initially levied a property tax to purchase land in I.V., but it effectively paid off the bond in June 2016, and the tax is no longer implemented.</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the special tax is the same amount that property owners were paying to fund the bond. Thus, if the tax measure passes, property owners will see no change in their taxes from the previous fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“They carefully crafted this,” said Joan Hartmann, the chair of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors who consented to the special election. She suggested that because the tax rates are so similar, “this new tax is just a continuation of what people were already paying.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said she originally wanted to put the special tax on the June 2016 ballot, but was unable to get it organized in time. She and other board members then intended to add the measure to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>This plan soon came to a halt last summer, however, after organizers from Yes on E&amp;F — the campaign which sought to establish a Community Services District (CSD) and a utility users tax in Isla Vista — asked the IVRPD board not to add the property tax to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, one of the Yes on E&amp;F organizers, said they didn’t want to have two tax measures on the same ballot. This would have increased the likelihood of both measures failing, he said.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, IVRPD board vice chair, said, however, that organizers were being detrimental to the community engagement process in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I thought that our conversations were already hurting relationships and were hurting our future engagement,” Dela Cruz said. “I was seeing, I think, some level of disrespect. I was seeing lack of collaboration.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said Measure F (the utility users tax measure) and the IVRPD special tax could have both passed, but the board ultimately opted to postpone for a later date.</p>\n<p>“IVRPD needs to be able to work with everybody,” she said. “I didn’t want the Park District to be the blame if [Measure] F failed.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD special tax did not appear on the November ballot. Measure F <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\">did not pass</a> on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Soutar told the Nexus on Tuesday that she foresees no opposition to the special tax, since the tax is no “additional burden” on property owners and since people are “partial to their parks.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can tailor this election to what’s strictly positive,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low priority calls. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Citizen Online Reporting system, as the Sheriff’s Office has named the software, is accessible through their website, sbsheriff.org, under the title “File an Online Report” on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, the public information officer for the County Sheriff’s Office, said the idea for the service was well-researched and that several deputies have worked to bring it into fruition.</p>\n<p>“We have deputies who research and selected the Cop Logic program and went through the process of researching what it would take to bring it to Santa Barbara County … and went through all the logistics to make it happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low-priority phone calls.</p>\n<p>In a press release Monday morning, Hoover said the “around-the-clock accessibility” will enable residents to “file a report at a time that is convenient to them without waiting for a deputy to respond or call them back.” Reportable incidents include identity theft, vandalism and stolen property, as well as civil complaints such as animal complaints, harassment via telephone and child custody violations.</p>\n<p>Hoover said this will give the deputies who normally file these incidents time to investigate other pressing instances of crime, as the software is meant to streamline the activities of police, “especially during a time when resources are limited.”</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office plans to focus more of its time on investigating trends in crime rather than filing reports which individuals themselves are able to submit.<br>\n“It just cuts back on the amount of time the deputy is working on paperwork that could be filled out by the citizen,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>She said the site is intuitive, but one problem that users might encounter is failing to understand the law enforcement’s jurisdiction when reporting a crime. Police cannot see to a crime that is outside of its legal capacity, as its system distinguishes on its web page. The Sheriff’s Office will not be investigating crimes outside of the county and encourages citizens to submit reports to their corresponding sheriff’s offices. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol office is located on 6504 Trigo Rd.</p>\n<p>For those unsure of how to file a report, the Sheriff’s Office has also created a video tutorial illustrating the process, which they have linked in the preface to their report submission software.</p>\n<p>As for the price of installing the online service, Hoover said the system cost $22,500 to install and that it will cost an additional $15,000 per year to keep running.</p>\n<p>Despite the online platform, officials say urgent offenses and situations must be reported directly with a 911 call.</p>\n<p>“The system is not designed to take the place of the deputy; if residents need to talk to a deputy, by all means we still want them to call,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The program is called Cop Logic, not top logic.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/","id":4489,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4488,4487,4486],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: I.V.

Students who understand its distinct culture are able to fulfill I.V.’s demands through various entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>\n<p>David Welsh and Michael Bakkie, two fourth-year economics majors at UCSB, saw a gap in supply and demand: Students needed a way to get groceries but didn’t have access to a car, and they had to rely on friends to go to a grocery store.</p>\n<p>They began developing the plan for their delivery model two years ago, culminating in the creation of Isla Vista Grocery Delivery, founded earlier this November.</p>\n<p>The alternative to making commutes to grocery stores, Welsh said, was either going to local, “overpriced” I.V. stores, eating at restaurants or getting a meal plan, all of which are more expensive than “reasonable eating.”</p>\n<p>The combination of students’ lack of options and mobility created a space for opportunists like Welsh and Bakkie to provide a solution.</p>\n<p>“I have always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, and this was a great way to start in a local market that I really know very well because I am one of these college students that would use this service,” Welsh said.</p>\n<p>The way Welsh sees it, a trip to the grocery store takes about an hour to complete: One has to drive there, drive back and buy everything. To a lot of people, he said, the effort needed to deal with that hassle is worth about $10.</p>\n<p>“If we can streamline that process and do it for a lot of students, that’s good business,” he said. “We really think this will save students’ time and money in the long run.”</p>\n<p>Welsh believes a lot of students will get behind “a startup started by other Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial ambition is also what drove fourth-year UCSB student Reese Hammerstrom to launch his own delivery service, D.I.V.E., during the fall of last year.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he came up with the business idea during the previous summer playing “Isla Vista’s sport” beer die.</p>\n<p>“Our die would keep bouncing off the balcony into the ocean and we would have to stop playing the game,” he said. “I was thinking of ways for a service where I could essentially press a button and dice would appear at my door.”</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he bought playing dice from Amazon that summer, delivered dice for a few weeks and, come Fall Quarter, realized there was opportunity to expand.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom was able to pinpoint what I.V. needed through direct interaction with local culture and consequently developed a business model. He called the model D.I.V.E., an acronym for Delivering Isla Vista Entertainment.</p>\n<p>Though Hammerstrom began by delivering supplies such as dice, lighters, ping-pong balls, cups and “chasers” to his friends, he “realized there was a bigger opportunity to expand beyond party supplies.”</p>\n<p>Last summer, he partnered with I.V. Market and now delivers party supplies, ice cream, drinks, munchies, house supplies and school supplies, “essentially anything a college student could need with the exception of cooked food,” he said.</p>\n<p>D.I.V.E.’s Vice President of Operations, Robert Holland, said the company is all about giving customers “complete control of their time.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vistans live an active lifestyle, and going to the store can be kind of a drag,” Holland said. “D.I.V.E. takes care of your everyday shopping needs, and for the fun times, D.I.V.E.’s got your dice, limes and Sprite, too.”</p>\n<p>Currently, delivery has been centered around a concentrated demand for Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, specifically the flavor “Half Baked.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s just a factor of the current hours of operation. Right now we’re only open from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. every night. That time kind of lends itself to ice cream and party supplies,” Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>There has been a particular surge in customer activity coming from the dorms, Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really great for freshmen,” he said, “Most people in their first year usually don’t have access to cars and to all these supplies and ice cream, and so freshman now are just pretty stoked about this service.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Kaitlyn Hague said she believes the need for delivery came from high demand, a lack of mobility and “student laziness.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve needed ice and dice last minute for parties, but some nights I’m just binge-watching Netflix and I really want ice cream without getting out of bed,” she said.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sarah Cragin, another student user of delivery services, said she has used it for party supplies like alcohol chasers because “we don’t realize we need it until the last second.”</p>\n<p>As students who once needed services unavailable in I.V., Welsh, Bakkie and Hammerstrom self-serviced. They filled not only their own needs as community members but also capitalized on the gap between supply and demand in I.V.</p>\n<p>As long as students in I.V. sustain their unique desires, student entrepreneurs will find a way to bridge the town’s gap of service.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1,3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74310\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74310\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/","id":4488,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[4487,4486,4485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bins Seek To Salvage Surf Gear","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74262\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74262\" data-attachment-id=\"74262\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/surfbox-by-oliver-zuniga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"surfbox-by-oliver-zuniga-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74262\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1-1024x774.jpg?resize=888%2C671\" alt=\"Hoping to finalize the project sometime during Winter Quarter, the I.V.

Surfrider Foundation, along with the nonprofit ReRip, will place bins on DP to collect and repurpose broken surfboards, wetsuits and other gear.<em> Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.</p>\n<p>The foundation intends to place a collection bin along the beachside intersections of Del Playa Drive for recycling all forms of damaged or used surf equipment.</p>\n<p>“The collection bin will be a physical emblem of Isla Vista sustainability efforts,” said Benny Drescher, an intern for I.V. Surfrider.</p>\n<p>The broken longboards, wetsuits and other surf gear will be distributed to artists and ReRip for repairs, and Drescher said ReRip will also use the materials to teach disadvantaged youth how to surf.</p>\n<p>According to ReRip’s website, the company salvages and reuses “everything from fins and broken bits to complete boards.” The company repairs “rideable boards” to be surfed again; some boards are resold and many are given away to schools, nonprofits and people in need.</p>\n<p>While the closest collection site to donate used surf materials is currently located in Ventura, the new collection bin initiative hopes to offer a more “accessible and convenient” means for student surfers to repurpose their trash.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) is still discussing procedures for maintaining the bins and managing their capacity.</p>\n<p>“The project needs stewardship,” said Dave Hubbard, director of the IVRPD, noting the tendency of “loose objects on Del Playa to get thrown off the cliff into the ocean.”</p>\n<p>At their board meeting on Nov. 10, the IVRPD Board of Directors voiced potential concerns about the project’s implementation, including the possibility of Isla Vista party-goers “pulling donations out and throwing them around the park,” or “setting the bin on fire.”</p>\n<p>“If the problem appears to be a reality, we can add a lock to the bins or erect a fence that will surround the bins,” said Surfrider organizers in their proposal. “Surfrider officers will frequently check the bins to organize materials and report to ReRip when a donation pickup is needed.”</p>\n<p>Together, I.V. Surfrider and IVRPD plan to make adjustments to the proposed wood box design and are considering incorporating surf and environmentalism-themed art on the bin’s frame to deter vandalism.</p>\n<p>With design proposals still underway, I.V. Surfrider aims to finalize the sustainability project by the middle of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/","id":4487,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4486,4485,4484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On in I.V.

The CSD has the power to improve infrastructure, institute community policing, mediate between tenants and landlords and run the community center, among other services.</p>\n<p>The failure of Measure F, however, took away the CSD’s ability to levy a utility user tax (UUT) — an 8 percent tax on the utilities of I.V. residents — meant to be the primary source of funding for the local body.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens now?</strong><br>\nYes on E&amp;F organizers have not written off Measure F just yet. There are still 1,349 provisional ballots to be counted Thursday, and proponents are hopeful that these ballots may swing the vote.</p>\n<p>Should Measure F still not pass, however, the future of the CSD could prove to be trivial.</p>\n<p>According to Darcél Elliott, Yes on E&amp;F campaign manager, monthly CSD board meetings could turn into a community space for residents to discuss issues at hand, but “they just wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“This has been the problem in Isla Vista for a long time. We have the ability to talk about things but not the ability to do anything about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for ways to obtain funds, newly elected CSD board member Jay Freeman said it will be difficult to obtain enough money “to pay for anything important.”</p>\n<p>The CSD board of directors could start a crowdfunding campaign, he said, but this is an unlikely option for matching the $512,000 that the UUT could have provided.</p>\n<p>It is also possible that the CSD board could apply for federal grants. The ultimate fate of the CSD, however, hangs on the passage of the UUT.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p>This leads to another issue: deciding when to put the UUT on the ballot again.</p>\n<p>Elliott said CSD board members could very well decide to propose the UUT in the next midterm election in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74096\" style=\"width: 6010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1521561605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74096\" data-attachment-id=\"74096\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/flashback-election-2012/dsc03790/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=6000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dsc03790\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, running another campaign would prove costly, Freeman said, and organizers are unsure where to obtain funds for subsequent campaigns. He said it would also be difficult to have voters approve a tax that has already been denied.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>\nAccording to Freeman, those active in the CSD movement for the past two years never talked much about the prospect of the CSD passing without the tax. Many proponents took it as given, he said, that the tax and the CSD would both pass.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the Yes on the E&amp;F campaign organizers limited their support by tying their campaign strictly to the campaigns of local Democrats like Congressional candidate Salud Carbajal and Third District County Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“They lost a lot of opportunity to form a coalition of disparate politicians,” he said.

She said they misled voters to believe the tax would significantly increase rent, when, in actuality, the tax would have only been an additional $5 to $10 every month.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes also gained an advantage over Yes on E&amp;F, she said, because they placed flyers on cars throughout Isla Vista. According to Elliott, this is what made Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes an “illegal” campaign.</p>\n<p>“If we left flyers on everyone’s cars, the results might have been different, but we would have been breaking county ordinance,” she said.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property owner who led the opposition to Measure F, said the measure didn’t pass simply because it is a “horrible” measure. This is why voters were afraid, he said.</p>\n<p>“What [Elliott] says is probably true, but a lot of times the truth will make people fearful of what will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Fear is the reason Measure F failed, Elliott said, and it has been a driving force throughout this election cycle.</p>\n<p>“In general in this election, fear won over hope,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/","id":4480,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4479,4478,4477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Weekly Goings-On in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Upcoming events include the local State of the Union, an IVRPD board meeting and a Poets’ Club open mic.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday at the I.V.

The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>PARK IT HERE</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN MIC</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Poets’ Club hosts an open mic at 8 p.m. Thursday at Coffee Collaborative. Organizers welcome poets, musicians and comedians.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLAH BACK</strong><br>\nUCSB Challah for Hunger hosts a bread sale from 12-2 p.m. Friday on the I.V. Food Co-op patio. The purpose of the sale is to raise money and awareness for social justice causes.</p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIAL GARDEN</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>BUILDING A COMMUNITY</strong><br>\nThere will be another meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center at 1 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. Clinic building. The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC) will be hosting the discussion and providing lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>SOW AND REAP</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Food Co-op is hosting a gardening workshop from 12-2 p.m. Sunday on the Co-op patio. The workshop will be led by Oscar Carmona of Healing Grounds Nursery in Goleta.</p>\n<p><strong>VEGAN</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>CHICKEN FOR KIDS</strong><br>\nEating dinner at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch (149 N. Fairview Avenue) between 5-9 p.m. on Tuesday will partially benefit the Isla Vista Youth Projects. The organization is currently undergoing a campaign to raise $300,000 before the end of the year so that it may qualify for an additional $300,000 grant from the county. Isla Vista Youth Projects intends to use the $600,000 to buy their building and close phase one of their capital campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE FOOD</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Youth Projects has been serving since 1971 through four programs: the Children’s Center, the After School Program, the Family Resource Center and Thrive I.V.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center serves children up to five years old, the After School Program serves children in kindergarten through the sixth grade, the Family Resource Center serves families of all sizes and Thrive focuses on “preparing students to enter kindergarten” and the “social-emotional component,” according to Thrive coordinator Julie Lara.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects aims to develop their niche even further by purchasing the Children’s Center building they currently occupy at 6842 Phelps Road. To do this, they must raise $300,000 by Dec. 31 in order to qualify for an additional $300,000 block grant from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center started out as a “very small program with just 20 students,” according to Juan Pimentel, the After School Program director, but has grown to “over 100” with waiting lists for all of the programs.</p>\n<p>From an overall campaign goal of $1.9 million, $1.2 million will be directed toward the Children’s Center, according to LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons why the I.V. Youth Project finds it so necessary to purchase the building is to keep costs low for the children and families who use the services provided by I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges of living in Santa Barbara is the cost of living, and childcare is pretty expensive … so having a children’s center here in I.V. … at either a very low cost or on scholarship most of the time is a really great opportunity,” said Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Just like many of the students at UCSB who worry about rent increases, the I.V. Youth Projects shares those same worries about renting the space for the Children’s Center. Both Pimentel and Miller said owning the building would prevent increases in program costs and save money in the long term.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t too much money to sponsor, say, another parenting class or another need that we might see,” said Lara. By not having to allocate money for rent every month, Lara said she hopes “any funding that does come in we can use for actual programming to make our facilities better.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects will host several fundraisers over the next month, including gatherings at Woodstocks, Panda Express and Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch. The group has also teamed up with Deckers Brand for a holiday shopping event.</p>\n<p>Money is even tighter at I.V. Youth Projects due to the fact that the childcare organization is independent from any national nonprofit organization. Additionally, I.V. is an unincorporated city, so I.V. Youth Projects does not receive city funding, according to Miller.</p>\n<p>“We do have some funding from the city of Goleta and from the County of Santa Barbara,” Miller said, but the organization doesn’t have access to “a lot of the same funding revenue stream that a lot of the other nonprofits might have that are located within a city.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects welcomes donations from any and all I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any donation big or small helps,” Miller said. “It’s very important to us that every child, no matter where they live … deserves to have an equal access to a superior education and a good walk on life.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch fundraiser will be hosted Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 5-9 p.m. and the Panda Express fundraiser will be hosted Friday, Dec. 9, from 12-9 p.m. in the Fairview Shopping Center.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print

Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>IVRPD</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 13, in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>Debate</strong><br>\nThe Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m. The debate will also air live on 91.9 FM KCSB.</p>\n<p><strong>Memorial Garden</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. on Friday to upkeep the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was built in May 2015 to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014 shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Concert in the Park</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Community Housing Office, the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and IVRPD are co-hosting a Kick-Off Community Concert on Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park (966 Embarcadero Del Mar) from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The event is for residents to interact with their property providers while listening to live music from local bands Mellow Grass, The Real Savage Henry and The Nitwits. Landlords, managers and owners from over 25 property providers will be at the event. There will also be a photo booth, succulent planting and prize giveaways.</p>\n<p><strong>Vegan</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. on Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Food</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, IVTU and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday, Oct. 19, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Voters</strong><br>\nCommunity volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters with as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by registering thousands more for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/","id":4641,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4640,4639,4638],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":17,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
