Businesses selling the stickers include Otaco, Hana Kitchen, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ, Hempwise and Sorriso Italiano.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen and Otaco owner Weston Suh said he started this project to help raise money for local charities such as Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project. The campaign is intended to give residents a way to both show their I.V. pride and support local businesses and charities at the same time, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I love Isla Vista … and the students here are really proud of living in I.V. and they know they have something special,” Suh said. “As great as it is, I know it can be so much more … Everything takes money.”</p>\n<p>Local charities often struggle to secure funding for their projects, which makes it very difficult to focus on achieving their goals, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is not really a city — one of the minuses is that funding is always an issue,” Suh said. “A lot of organizations have to spend so much time running around trying to get funding that they can’t focus on their projects … it’s kind of a catch-22.”</p>\n<p>Suh said he hopes the stickers will be just the first part of the campaign and plans to expand it if students respond positively.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we just have bumper stickers, but hopefully we can expand to bigger things and raise tens of thousands of dollars,” said Suh. “That’s really the goal … There’s a lot we can do.”</p>\n<p>According to Suh, Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project are the first charities that he hopes to work with, and more will follow as the program expands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/","id":4678,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[4677,4676,4675],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Misconceptions, University Involvement","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista community members met in the I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the weekly stakeholders’ meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams proposed AB 3 in December to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., which, if passed, would tax residents using a Utility Users Tax (UUT) and would garner funds to improve public services in I.V., such as parking and lighting. UCSB Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow presented an update on the university’s position regarding the inclusion of the university in the CSD as outlined in AB 3. Local business owner Jay Freeman gave an hour-and-a hal- presentation on pressing issues in I.V., past attempts to incorporate I.V. into Goleta and Goleta’s cityhood process.</p>\n<p>Freeman said stakeholders should consider going through the LAFCO process to assess whether or not I.V. could become a CSD.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said UCSB is not opposed to a CSD, but does not want the university to be included within I.V.’s boundaries because of the unknown precedent it may set for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The University of California has communicated with Assemblymember Williams’ office that, at this point, the university should not be in,” Thurlow said. “This does not mean we are opposed to AB 3, this does not mean we are opposed to self-government or any other measures, but because of the nature of what AB 3 is … nobody knows the implications.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V.’s problems such as parking and lighting will not be immediately solved by the establishment of a CSD, as some students may believe.</p>\n<p>“The issues here just kind of stay, and I think it’s something we don’t spend enough time talking about, which is kind of the difference in mindset between students,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said there have been previous efforts to divert I.V. celebrations, such as Halloween, into more structured events.</p>\n<p>“In 2003 we actually had Dia de Los Muertos celebrations on October 31,” Freeman said. “I think it’s interesting that we were already having events on Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the current LAFCO board should not be judged based on decisions made by boards in previous years since its members change every year.</p>\n<p>“If you really think that LAFCO in 2001 was a horrible, horrible thing, they’ve replaced their staff, and now have internal staff they don’t contract out anymore,” Freeman said. “All of the commissioners except these two, one of whom is in the room [Craig Geiser] and has been very friendly to us.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-63820\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Last year’s paddle out attracted nearly 3,000 students and community members.<em> Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Surf Team will host the second annual Isla Vista Memorial Paddle Out on May 27 at 6 p.m. at the beach in front of the UCSB Lagoon and Manzanita Village to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Following the events of May 23 last year, approximately 3,000 students and I.V. community members attended Surf Team’s first annual paddle out. Students and I.V. community members on surfboards formed a circle about 50 yards offshore, while others remained on the beach. This year, UCSB Surf Team plans to host a similar ceremony, with nearly 3,000 identifying as attending on the event’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year communication major Stephanie Schechter said she expects 2,000–5,000 students to attend, with 1,000 paddling out to form the circle.</p>\n<p>“The reason we expect this turnout not only reflects on last year’s turnout, but also reflects on that this event is very positive,” Schechter said. “By having a really positive event, it might help people heal in a different way.”</p>\n<p>Paddle outs are a century-old Hawaiian tradition to honor the lives of those who have passed away, and they symbolize the belief that spirits continue to live in the ocean, according to Schechter.</p>\n<p>“In the modern sense, it’s kind of like closure,” Schechter said. “It’s sort of a way for the community to unite in remembrance for those who have passed — their spirits are moving on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said she has attended many paddle outs, but the strength and unity of the participants in Surf Team’s paddle out in May 2014 was unique.</p>\n<p>“It was honestly one of the most incredible experiences I have been part of,” Vlaco said in an email. “There were so many different opinions and disagreements from people regarding the shootings and the events that happened, but the paddle out was something that we were all 100 percent unified and together on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Alex Manrique said the event will be open to all community members, including those who prefer to remain on the beach.</p>\n<p>“I surf myself, but I get a really inclusive vibe from this event that’s open to anyone with or without a board,” Manrique said in an email. “I know Isla Vista isn’t this utopia it’s made out to be, but it definitely has its moments. This will definitely be one of those moments.”</p>\n<p>Manrique, a transfer student who did not attend UCSB last year, said the paddle out is a way to unite all attendees in remembrance and solidarity.</p>\n<p>“I’m participating in this paddle out to commemorate those that were lost to last year’s tragedy,” Manrique said in an email. “I feel that anyone who attends, whether they live here or not, is there for the same reason, and that’s to show solidarity.”</p>\n<p>Surf Team plans to provide lifeguards and safety personnel and asks attendees to bring boards, floats, kayaks and wetsuits to the paddle out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/","id":4675,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4674,4673,4672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Representation","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IVStakeholder_JohnClow_05.19.2015_05.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IVStakeholder_JohnClow_05.19.2015_05.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and government administrators met in the I.V.

Clinic Building Tuesday night for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting hosted by the office of Assemblymember Das Williams.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed the progress of Williams’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which calls for the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. On Wednesday of last week, the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government voted 6-1 to re-refer AB 3 to the Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation and Classification, the first in a long series of steps towards the bill’s passage through the state legislature.</p>\n<p>Community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said AB 3 will now go to the Assembly Appropriations Committee to request the State cover the cost of a county-level election to approve of the potential CSD.</p>\n<p>“Since the state is requiring the county put it on the ballot, that’s a state mandate so now it has to go to appropriations and we have to figure out if the state is going to reimburse the county for the cost of the elections,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliott said UCSB is currently included within the boundaries of the proposed CSD, though the university’s involvement in the CSD remains unclear. UCSB administration as well as the UC Office of the President (UCOP) have expressed concern about participating in the CSD, according to Elliott.</p>\n<p>“The university has concerns about being in the district and it’s been picked up by UCOP,” Elliott said. “They had a meeting in Sacramento with Das where they said they were concerned about being in the district. We’re trying to set up a meeting with the chancellor and some of his team with Das to kind of negotiate that and get what their concerns are and potential solutions.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board member Jacob Lebell said he is in favor of both university and county representation on the CSD board. Presently, AB 3 calls for a seven member board — five of whom are to be elected with two standing positions, one for UCSB and one for Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we would be doing would involve the university and the county and bringing them into the process for it would greatly increase the ease of collaboration and help us to navigate both institutions as well,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said he would prefer the university representative be elected by the Academic Senate which has multiple people, rather than by the Chancellor alone, as the bill language currently states.</p>\n<p>“I just like the idea of having the appointed person maybe be appointed by the Academic Senate,” Lebell said. “I feel like I would trust that person to be look from the university’s perspective, but whose loyalty would be to I.V. and not looking to simply represent the chancellor’s office. It would make it more of a democratic process to elect that position, having a body instead of one person able to appoint.”</p>\n<p>In discussions regarding the extent to which the university and county standing positions should participate in decision making, UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Jeremy Roark said the standing positions could serve as board members who advise but do not vote.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if it’s possible to outline the appointed positions in a way in which perhaps they are voting for some things but not all things,” Roark said. “Maybe there are certain things we are okay with them voting on but others we are not.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said her main focus is to ensure the two appointed board members are well-informed about I.V., regardless of whether they vote or not.</p>\n<p>“I’m not attached to them having voting powers, but what I did like about having those two seats is that I looked at those as two seats that would serve out all four years,” Soutar said. “So for me I thought, especially if they’re going to be staggered, there will always be someone who knows the conversations that have happened in the past four years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he agrees with Soutar that the university and county-appointed board members should be knowledgeable about I.V.’s history in order to contribute to informed discussions before decisions are made.</p>\n<p>“I think their role is very much to be that continuity or to say, ‘This happened before,’ or, ‘You should consider this,’” Minoiefar said. “And they need to be there at all of the discussions and need not take part in the vote, but they need to be there.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/","id":4674,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4673,4672,4671],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Groups Dedicate Memorial Garden","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"On Saturday, the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District and Project I.V.

Love held the I.V. Love and Remembrance Garden dedication ceremony for the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at a ceremony in the newly planted garden at People’s Park.</p>\n<p>UCSB administrators, students and Associated Students, county officials and representatives from participating organizations, such as Woodstock’s Pizza, Santa Barbara Forge + Iron and Seaborn Designs spoke at the event, officially opening the newly renovated park. The previous weekend, volunteers planted saplings and constructed a walking path through People’s Park around six benches with unique patterns representing the interests of each victim of the May 23 tragedy. Project I.V. Love founder and UCSB alumnus Jordan Killebrew, fourth-year art major Caila Baltas and fourth-year art major Jonathan Holcomb designed the benches and were present at the dedication.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the garden is a “healing” place for the community to reflect on their memories of the victims.</p>\n<p>“This is a place where I think all of us can … sit here and connect with those precious lives, our friends, our fellow students who left us way too soon in their lives,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Killebrew said while the idea for the garden initially stemmed from his feelings of hopelessness following the tragedy, he appreciates the ability to honor the victims through the project.</p>\n<p>“It was way too close to home for me,” Killebrew said. “A year ago I would never have imagined this would happen and I’m just so happy that I have the opportunity to do something for the victims that we lost.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the circular design of the benches represents unity and “togetherness.”</p>\n<p>“The curves on the benches, if we were to put them in a circle, they form a perfect circle and the unity of those six students and imagining that for me is very, very comforting and very healing,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Sam Spinner said he believes the memorial garden will have a lasting, positive impact on the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great,” Spinner said. “I think we really needed something memorable for the next students to come here and realize how big of an impact this event made on us. It’s beautiful and all the benches are amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year theater and film &amp; media studies double major Kirsten Nygaard said the garden is an important step towards the regrowth of I.V. after the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really wonderful that they were able to create something for the community to heal and to grow and to remember life and love,” Nygaard said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V. is stronger and more united than she has ever seen it in her time as supervisor.</p>\n<p>“I am always proud to represent Isla Vista,” Farr said. “But in the seven years I have represented this community I have never been prouder of Isla Vista than I am at this moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Williams wrote AB 3 as an alternative to establishing a CSD through the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in order to address the need for improved infrastructure and services in the I.V. community. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud organized a group of UCSB students and I.V. residents to speak in favor of the bill during public comment.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams said the bill is going straight to the committee because previous attempts to establish I.V. self-governance over the last 45 years have been stifled by LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“When a local LAFCO cannot take care of a very important, complicated but ever-present problem for 45 years, do we have the authority to take that back and act ourselves?” Williams said. “I think we do.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill has been thoroughly evaluated by the community since first being introduced to the Assembly in December.</p>\n<p>“While the CSD is not going through the traditional LAFCO process, this bill has undergone extensive community outreach, including 42 public meetings and four public town halls,” Williams said. “It truly reflects the majority opinion from the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the current conditions in I.V. are at a “breaking point” and require improved services such as additional police, a parking district and a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Critical infrastructure and services are not being provided and the safety and wellbeing of I.V.’s residents are not being adequately protected,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said AB 3 is an opportunity to redefine I.V. through the establishment of CSD.</p>\n<p>“We have consistently had a lack of opportunity to prove ourselves,” Schunk said. “We are consistently at the behest of media sources and every time something happens in Isla Vista, we are painted colors that we have no choice or say in.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Local Governance Committee Assemblymember and UCSB alumnus Brian Maienschein said, while he chose to abstain from voting on the motion because of his connection to USCB, he plans to continue working with Williams on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is unique,” Maienschein said. “I have been persuaded by the testimony today and just kind of my life experience there, so I won’t quite get to ‘yes,’ but I want to keep working with you and your office on this.”</p>\n<p>Maienschein said that AB 3 resonates with him on a personal level because of his experience living in Isla Vista for three years.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista sits in a unique position,” Maienschein said, “because of all the issues that have traditionally been there back since my time up through the current time. In fact, the latest incident was in literally one of the exact blocks I lived on. So this hits close to home for me.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-three year I.V. resident and homeowner Pegeen Souter said she opposes the bill and favors the LAFCO process because she feels AB 3 does not clarify funding and the role of UC Santa Barbara in a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It takes time and information to craft a solid and lasting form of government,” Souter said. “If this bill is to move forward, then it should go through the LAFCO process.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara LAFCO Executive Officer Paul L. Hood said the commission is taking an “oppose unless amended position” on AB 3, and the commission should be included in the formation process to ensure a financially feasible CSD.</p>\n<p>“We strongly believe the Santa Barbara LAFCO should be involved in the formation process,” Hood said. “We also believe that the LAFCO process would afford a feasibility study to be prepared, which would determine the viability, the sustainability of revenues that would be available to the new CSD.”</p>\n<p>California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions (CALAFCO) Executive Director Pamela Miller said the commission does not oppose the CSD itself, but believes LAFCO should be included in its establishment.</p>\n<p>“CALAFCO is not arguing whether or not a CSD is the appropriate mechanism, our concerns lie in the bypassing of the LAFCO process,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller said, while there are certain components in AB 3 that LAFCO cannot grant, excluding the commission may lead to greater risks.</p>\n<p>“It is true, as the assemblyman said that LAFCO cannot approve the proposed governance structure or the proposed services to be provided,” Miller said. “But bypassing the comprehensive analysis is very dangerous … all of our concerns would be addressed if a comprehensive review by the LAFCO were done.”</p>\n<p>Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs board member and second-year communications and film and media studies double major Arielle Kronovet said one the biggest issues facing I.V. is inadequate parking.</p>\n<p>“I’m lucky I have parkway so I don’t have to deal with parking,” Kronovet said. “But last year I was searching sometimes for hours trying to find parking, and I couldn’t afford parking on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Kronovet, students need the government to protect students from property management companies that abuse their power and take advantage of students.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year, my house was robbed,” Kronovet said. “There was no evidence of forced entry so the property management wouldn’t change the locks and they had a key. I called the property management, and they told me it wasn’t a high priority issue.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said a CSD in I.V. will require components LAFCO cannot establish, such as a UUT and a hybrid board with elected and hybrid board with elected and appointed members representing entities such as UCSB, SBCC and Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted to convey to the legislature was the uniqueness of Isla Vista, and the fact that we had demanded a unique solution, requiring some elements that [neither] LAFCO nor the board of supervisors could grant,” Farr said. “Only the legislature could.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO members should offer alternative ways to help I.V. rather than criticize AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I can understand [LAFCO] having concerns, but they did not express more concern and care for the future of the community,” Farr said. “You can have questions and you can have concerns, but also, show us that you really do want to be helpful. I have to say I haven’t gotten that sense at the meetings.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, Isla Vista does not have a high source of income from sales or property taxes.</p>\n<p>“[I.V.] doesn’t have a lot of commercial development or other kinds of sales tax or transient occupancy tax generators, hotels and such and the community,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Properties in the community don’t change hands very often, so the property tax that has been being paid is probably much lower than if the property was sold and then reassessed.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator-elect and second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he appreciates Farr’s supporting AB 3 regardless of her position in the county.</p>\n<p>“She’s always been there for Isla Vista and been working hard for the county to focus on it,” Mariano said. “She’s in a tight squeeze, but I am very grateful she was for the bill, because she knows Isla Vista needs help.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said Maienschein’s support of AB 3 shows the importance of I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It shows Isla Vista has faced the same issues over and over without a way to correct them permanently,” Abboud said. “The root of the issue has been no local control and no local self-determination. I think him being moved by his own personal experiences is indicative of why we need to pass this bill.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, students have shown they can efficiently hold leadership positions regardless of how long they live and stay in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Students are regularly elected and do a wonderful job,” Abboud said. “Just because students with a little ‘S’ are transient, students with a big ‘S’ aren’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article was titled “Contested Bill Addresses Isla Vista Self-Governance”.

Clinic building are currently underway, and new tenants providing mental health reseources for I.V. residents are set to move in in July. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved a renovation budget of approximately $335,000 for the Isla Vista Clinic building on Tuesday to refurbish and lease currently vacant office spaces.</p>\n<p>The planned renovations will allow for additional tenants to lease office spaces in the building, one-third of which is currently used by I.V. Clinic. Of the nine organizations who applied for a lease, Santa Barbara County general services staff chose the Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Regents of the University of California and Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. for the clinic. All three are slated to sign five-year leases and to agree to a three percent annual rent increase.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Assistant Director for General Services Greg Chanis said the county assumed ownership of the building last summer and chose these three specific nonprofit organizations to best serve community needs.</p>\n<p>­“There was a lot of community support for the county to retain ownership of the building,” Chanis said. “Based on that, the county is really working on having the building be a community asset.”</p>\n<p>According to the Board of Supervisors’ proposal for the clinic renovations, the Regents will lease space to set up offices for a variety of campus mental health services available to students and I.V. residents. Resources will include Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.), Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>Third-year literature and sociology major and former C.A.R.E. student staff member Emily Potter said expanding C.A.R.E.’s services in I.V. will be beneficial to non-students seeking support.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be excellent for the community to have a space like CARE in Isla Vista,” Potter said in an email. “CARE’s services are not just limited to UCSB students so I’m really excited at the possibility that the additional location will let students from SBCC and other community members with a need for advocacy resources to feel they have better access to them.”</p>\n<p>Potter said the community will benefit greatly from the renovation of these spaces, as this means there will be room for the expansion of mental health services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It will allow services like CARE to expand because of the additional space and I think there is a great need for that, so the opportunity for the growth of the program is great too,” Potter said in email.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. Fiscal Manager and Board Member Arthur Kennedy said the leased office space will be used for the organization’s administrative needs, though they are also considering incorporating other services such as a weekly family resource center.</p>\n<p>“We need the space, because we only have about four office workers in our Goleta office,” Kennedy said. “But we are considering having a weekly family resource center availability within these offices as well as other services.”</p>\n<p>According to Chanis, renovations are underway and tenants are expected to move into the office spaces in July.</p>\n<p>“We’re finishing up the exterior stairwell, and are nearly completed with the roof,” Chanis said. “So the interior and exterior are undergoing renovations that should open up the space for the tenants.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said while the I.V. Clinic renovations will provide necessary services, she plans to develop a community center in the building adjacent to the clinic that formerly housed the Saint Athanasius church.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the space that we want as a community center — we are still looking for the moment to do that at the rehabilitation of a former church building,” Farr said. “The tenants should be meeting this summer at the new fiscal year and then I’m turning my attention to rehabilitating the church to turn into a community center.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of teh Thursday May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The highly selective SHCD certificate allows the city access to state funds for planned affordable housing developments, according to Greene.</p>\n<p>Greene said Goleta received $3.6 million in “active transportation grants,” that will fund bicycle path and walkway improvements.</p>\n<p>According to Greene, retail and industrial vacancies are both low at less than three percent vacancy, and hotel occupancy increased 13.8 percent over the last year.</p>\n<p>Greene also said an increase in revenue from taxes such as the Transient Occupancy Tax and Sales Tax indicate Goleta’s financial future is bright.</p>\n<p>“Goleta is an excellent place to start and run a business,” Greene said. “Goleta’s overall position is solid and our future is promising.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said there are plans to revamp Goleta’s Old Town and capitalize on the uniquely authentic quality that it offers Goleta residents.</p>\n<p>“We have so many great neighborhoods in Goleta that are already flourishing,” Miller said. “But there’s something that feels like our soul and our purpose when we visit Old Town.”</p>\n<p>President and CEO of Montecito Bank and Trust Janet Garufis said the Goleta business community has played a crucial role in the immense progress the city has made over the past years.</p>\n<p>“The businesses in Goleta are so connected to each other, it is just extraordinary,” Garufis said. “There are so many great things happening in this community and that could not happen without the support of local businesses.”</p>\n<p>According to Bacara Resort &amp; Spa General Manager Kathleen Cochran, supporting local business in Goleta is crucial to the development of the city.</p>\n<p>“I live here, I do all of my business here,” Cochran said. “Community partnership and hospitality go hand in hand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63471\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63471\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/","id":4709,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[4708,4707,4706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blunite Seeks to Unite I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Blunite_Hari-Patel_05092015-11949-e1431330085524.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Blunite_Hari-Patel_05092015-11949-e1431330085524.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students from Art Professor Kim Yasuda’s class “I.V.

Open Lab” began selling blue LED tea lights and ropes on May 9 to be placed throughout UCSB’s campus and Isla Vista as part of “Blunite,” one part of the series of May 23 memorial events.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab students have asked individuals to place the tea lights at their residences and have worked with local business owners to plan light installments in I.V. restaurants. The Blunite project was inspired by the Media Arts and Technology graduate program’s idea to line Pardall Tunnel with blue LED lights to signify the connection between I.V. and UCSB. The Blunite lights use LED technology invented by Nobel Prize-winning UCSB Professor Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab student and second-year art and theater double major Madeline Berger said Blunite will symbolize unity in I.V. throughout May.</p>\n<p>“Blunite is a way to unify us together in solidarity and bring light and hope to our community even though there was so much darkness last year,” Berger said. “We are really trying to focus not so much on the memorial or the tragedy but more on how to show that we are just as unified as we were last year as a community, we really want to make this an annual tradition.”</p>\n<p>Berger said I.V. businesses including Sweet Alley, Pizza My Heart, Sorriso Italiano and Buddha Bowls have cooperated with Blunite organizers.</p>\n<p>“Every single business we’ve talked to has been like ‘That’s an awesome idea,’” Berger said. “We just installed Sorriso’s and Buddha Bowls’ yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Berger said Blunite hopes to distribute the same LED lights at the memorial candlelight vigil planned for the evening of May 23 and that Blunite provides an opportunity for individuals to support I.V. even if they no longer live in the community.</p>\n<p>“This could be something that people could do in New York City if they went to school here and are in grad school now and want to show their support, they can put a tea light in their window and take a picture and send it to us,” Berger said. “Businesses can get involved and students can get involved … it’s a different way of getting people to join together in something.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab student and third-year communication and art major Raphaella Faria said the project organizers hope every I.V. resident will get involved with Blunite so the community can “glow blue” by the end of May.</p>\n<p>“People are cooperating really well but we are just trying to get the word out faster,” Faria said, “We are hoping that, with people starting to show their support, others will be inspired by them.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to be an all month thing,” Berger said. “It’s kind of turned into something where at the vigil you can carry them, so we are trying to get funding so we can pass them out at the vigil. It’s a good way to not have flame and wax dripping on everything.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Brian Attard, who purchased a light Saturday at the Pardall Center, Blunite’s message of unity will benefit I.V. during the anniversary of the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to preserve the memories of the people we lost and to look at their families and how they moved on and just draw strength from that as a community,” Attard said. “It’s a nice gesture to have these lights, it’s very UCSB because the guy who invented them is a professor here so it all kind of works out.”</p>\n<p>Blunite will use profits from the light sales throughout May to provide free tea lights for those who can’t purchase them for the vigil, according to Berger.</p>\n<p>“The tea lights are getting sold for a dollar, but they cost us 70 cents,” Berger said. “So the extra 30 cents is coming back to us so that we can buy lights that we can just give out to people that can’t afford them, or at the vigil.”</p>\n<p>Students can purchase tea lights and ropes at the Pardall Center, participating restaurants such as Buddha Bowls and Sorriso Italiano or by messaging the Blunite Facebook page.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/","id":4706,"author":{"id":173,"name":"Adelaide Burk"},"related":[4705,4704,4703],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Update on Sabado Tarde Rd.

Gutierrez is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Participating in a Criminal Street Gang and Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>SBCSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the shooting “triggers” emotions given the one-year anniversary of the events of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064422\"><span class=\"aQJ\">May 23</span></span> is less than two weeks away.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, everybody out here right now is very sensitive right now, coming on heels of the one-year anniversary, just the thought of anyone being injured out here in Isla Vista, I think, just makes everyone’s heart sink,” Hoover said. “So there is definitely great concern on behalf of the public. We’re getting lots of calls — a lot of people very, very worried.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said while it is uncertain whether <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064423\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Monday’s</span></span> shooting is connected to the three armed robberies that took place last week, law enforcement has reason to believe there is a connection between the robberies that occurred on May 3 and May 4.</p>\n<p>“At this point, that is all under investigation. It’s likely there is a relation between definitely the alleged victim, who also later was arrested,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 6:39 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p>\n<div

3\" width=\"170\" height=\"214\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59588\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was one of two commissioners to oppose the motion against AB 3</p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) voted Thursday to oppose Assembly Bill 3, Assemblymember Das Williams’ initiative for Isla Vista self-governance through a Community Services District (CSD), unless amended to include the commission in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>LAFCO met in the in the Board of Supervisors room in Santa Maria, where it voted to oppose AB 3 five-to-two. The bill’s current language circumvents the LAFCO process by stating the CSD and its funding mechanism, a Utility Users Tax (UUT), will be ratified by a vote of its potential residents.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr and public comment participants spoke in favor of AB 3, while other commissioners said it does not sufficiently clarify the role of UC Santa Barbara, the CSD’s boundaries and the district’s financial feasibility, especially for funding special approval elections.</p>\n<p>Long term I.V. resident and UCSB Economics Lecturer Lanney Ebenstein said he has lived in I.V. since 1961 and, despite the costs, believes a CSD is the “best opportunity” for I.V. he has seen in his time in the community.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has unique issues — both as board compensation and funding — that make state legislation necessary,” Ebenstein said. “There is no question that it would be an expense to the county, but, in the long run, I believe it is very much to the County of Santa Barbara’s financial benefit to see that there is an Isla Vista Community Services District.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associate Student Government Senator and I.V. resident Ethan Bertrand said SBCC A.S. unanimously voted to support AB 3, and he is in favor of a parking district to better manage parking in the streets of I.V. and monitor I.V. visitors.</p>\n<p>“A parking district as included in AB 3 would allow more control for who can park in Isla Vista, which would help regulate out-of-towners and just bring more order to our streets,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Aceves said a parking district can be established through Santa Barbara County and does not require AB 3.</p>\n<p>“This thing about the parking district — the county can do that,” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he is not unwilling to form a CSD through LAFCO, but feels some members of the board would oppose the bill regardless of whether it went through the LAFCO process or not.</p>\n<p>“I just personally get the feeling that LAFCO is going to oppose AB 3 CSD whether we include LAFCO in the process or not,” Abboud said. “I’m getting the feeling from comments that your [LAFCO’s] board members have already said in public that this will not pass, regardless, so including you in the process almost seems like a moot point, because to include you would be to kill the bill at a later date.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said LAFCO and Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative should work together to focus on the main problem of addressing I.V.’s community needs instead of opposing each other’s ideas.</p>\n<p>“Just take a step back and look at [what] the problem we are really trying to solve is, which is the safety and welfare of residents in Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “We could just negotiate and work in good faith together without any preconceived notion of what should happen in Isla Vista and focus on what the residents think should happen … instead of coming up with your own idea of blocking the ideas of people who have been working on it for years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he does not see a purpose in including LAFCO, because the commission consistently opposes the bill.</p>\n<p>“Last Tuesday, we did discuss including LAFCO in the process, but if you oppose the bill, why would we want to bring you into the discussion furtherly?” Mariano said. “We do want to bring you in on the implementation of the CSD, but if you really oppose it, there’s really no point because you’re not going to want the CSD to succeed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said the bill should not face opposition because it is representative of the needs of many I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s illogical to oppose or question this movement, because it’s a grassroots movement, and there has been information gathered across the board with regards to Latino families, students and even individuals who own houses in Isla Vista,” Garcia said. “We’ve been working for this for many hours and many weeks and this is a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD­) Board Member Jacob Lebell said I.V needs representatives that would work with Santa Barbara County, UCSB and law enforcement to solve larger issues on behalf of the community.</p>\n<p>“Other entities such as the county, UCSB and the police need to have representatives of our community that they can talk to, negotiate and partner with to really address the large number of problems that our community is facing,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said while he believes LAFCO members can potentially contribute to the CSD plan, their uncompromising attitude discourages him from wanting to work with them.</p>\n<p>“I do understand your concerns about AB 3 circumventing the LAFCO process,” Lebell said. “I think you all have value to add to it, but I would just like to make you aware that a lot of my fellow residents are quite frankly afraid of you.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said the lack of sales tax and a transient occupancy tax in AB 3 is concerning for business owners, and the Utility Users Tax is the only tax item left in the bill.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Downtown Business Association has been meeting recently, and one of the things that has come up there is that Utility Users Tax is the only tax that is left in the bill,” Freeman said. “The sales tax and the transient occupancy tax has been removed, and that’s a concern amongst business owners because it affects businesses.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he supports I.V. self-governance but does not think AB 3 will be a sufficient foundation without intervention from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“The boundaries for the university are confusing,” Freeman said. “This is one of the many reasons why I have continued to believe that LAFCO should be involved.”</p>\n<p>LAFCO Vice-chair Craig Geyer said amendments to AB 3 address issues from LAFCO’s Feb. 19 letter of concern, such as board makeup and district boundaries, but the ad hoc committee on the bill still wants to see an amendment stating the CSD formation will go through LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“I think, at the end of the day, the consensus from the ad hoc committee was basically we should maintain an opposed position unless the motion comes back through local LAFCO,” Geyer said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Welt said he sees progress in the amendments to AB 3 thus far and hopes Williams’ office will “keep up the good work,” but is not ready to support the bill without further clarification on the role of UCSB and funding for proposed elections.</p>\n<p>“You are starting to fill in the blanks,” Welt said. “I think there’s a couple things that are still hanging out there that give me reason to wait on this a little bit further.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Janet Wolf also said AB 3 was making progress in clarifying the questions posed in the letter.</p>\n<p>“In our letter of opposition, we did get the chance to specify what some of our issues were,” Welt said. “This bill is moving forward — a lot of those questions are being answered, such as the makeup of the board and the boundaries”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Steve Lavagnino said he feels Santa Barbara County provides adequate services to I.V making AB 3 unnecessary and insulting.</p>\n<p>“I guess we take it a little personally — at least I do — on the Board of Supervisors when people say they are not getting the services they need in an unincorporated area,” Lavagino said. “The county’s really stepping up and providing a level of service that you might not see in a lot of other areas.”</p>\n<p>Welt said the lack of information on the proposed CSD’s financial feasibility limits the commission’s support of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I really believe in the power of that feasibility study,” Welt said. “Finance is really important here, and the feasibility study might flush that out.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he agrees with Lavagino that supporters of AB 3 take county services for granted.</p>\n<p>“I agree with Commissioner Lavagino,” Aceves said. “I would take offense to that, because a lot of money spent is providing the necessary services, but now we’re asking to add additional taxes.”</p>\n<p>But Farr said I.V. needs more services than the county can provide, and a CSD with a UUT would create the needed funding.</p>\n<p>“In looking at all the things the CSD wants to do, I could go down every one of them and tell you how we have tried and continue to try to find the money to support so many of these,” Farr said. “Without a dedicated source of funding for Isla Vista, the county is not going to be able to keep up with what it needs”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said LAFCO should not support AB 3 until a financial feasibility study is complete.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think any of us in any of our jurisdictions will move forward on anything without finding out first if it makes financial sense,” Lavagino said. “The only way we can do that is with a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said he fears student proponents of AB 3 are unrealistic in their support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I feel like these young people are well-intentioned and maybe have been sold something they feel is a panacea,” Lavagino said. “If this thing goes down the road … my fear is, down that road, you’re going to be looking five years after the CSD is there and saying ‘Wow I don’t see a whole heck of a lot that’s different.’”</p>\n<p>According to Aceves, only a city or county can impose a Utility Users Tax, meaning a CSD imposing a UUT in I.V. would require additional legislation.</p>\n<p>“How can this bill authorize a special district to it, because that is, in my mind, concerning, because every special district in the county would want to take advantage of that if they could.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO is not impeding the CSD formation process as many AB 3 supporters suggested, but rather doing their job.</p>\n<p>“We are legislatively required to follow the law,” Aceves said. “It’s what we have to do as a Local Agency Formation Commission for the orderly development of special districts or cities, and this one doesn’t even want to talk to us.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he was concerned AB 3 allows 10 years for I.V. residents to approve a UUT by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>“What are these board members going to do for ten years with no money?” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>Moorhouse also said he was concerned about the bill’s establishment of a 10-year period for approval of the tax.</p>\n<p>“We could actually have an election every year,” Moorhouse said. “Tens upon tens of thousands of dollars could be spent.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Bob Orach said he thinks the proposed CSD should better incorporate IVRPD.</p>\n<p>“It would seem to me that the CSD having that power and authority — those local officials that are concerned about their parks and recreation — why wouldn’t they be included?” Orach said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said AB 3 should follow the LAFCO process in order to form a long-term solution for I.V., and it is important to include larger I.V. entities, such as UCSB, in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do this the right way and do the process the way it should be done, so when change is made, it’s sustainable and will last for generations,” Moorhouse said. “I don’t think that’s gonna happen until you get some of the major players participating. UCSB has been one of the entities that has helped create this disadvantaged community. We need to get UCSB to the table.”</p>\n<p>Moorhouse said AB 3 takes away local power by allowing the state legislature to mandate county-level elections.</p>\n<p>“In the language that is currently proposed, it states that the County of Santa Barbara is going to put it on the ballot,” Moorhouse said. “We are being told by the state legislature that we are going to expend thousands upon thousands of dollars for an election.”</p>\n<p>Geyer said Williams should amend AB 3 to include LAFCO in the CSD establishment process.</p>\n<p>“What I support is opposing this bill until it’s amended to include the formation of the proposed district through the local LAFCO,” Geyer said. “Most of the questions — district boundary, financial feasibility — that would all be vetted through our normal LAFCO process”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO should have used more positive language in its initial stance on the bill.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity to try to do something, finally, for Isla Vista,” Farr said. “If LAFCO initially had taken a position of ‘support if amended,’ as opposed to ‘opposed unless amended,’ even though they seem to be two sides of the same coin, I think the import is much different.”</p>\n<p>Fox also said LAFCO should take a more supportive stance of AB 3 while voicing concerns about potential issues.</p>\n<p>“We need to take ‘unless amended’ out of there for some more positive words that say ‘we’re here to help you as an organization of LAFCOs,” Fox said.</p>\n<p>Wolf also said LAFCO should help the I.V. self-governance movement and motioned that the commission support AB 3 if amended.</p>\n<p>“I think we should take an affirmative stance,” Wolf said. “I think we should support this bill and make recommendations for amendments and/or clarifications.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO should not support the bill until members are satisfied with its language and made a substitute motion to oppose the bill unless amended to include LAFCO in the CSD formation.</p>\n<p>“The amendment will include specifics,” Aceves said. “One: that they go through LAFCO, and two: that they have a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Aceves’ motion passed in a five-to-two vote, with only Farr and Wolf voting against it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

holding a hearing regarding Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 13 in the Sacramento Legislative Office building to decide whether to send the bill to the Senate floor or to refute the legislation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams’ office has made several amendments to the bill since it was introduced to the California State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista, which would have the ability to levy taxes to fund local services and infrastructure. The Assembly’s Local Governance Committee will now determine whether it will be submitted to the full Assembly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said if the Assembly’s Local Governance Committee approves of the bill in the hearing next week, the legislation will continue on the path to be officiated by October of this year.</p>\n<p>“The hearing next week will determine if the bill moves on to full assembly or not,” Abboud said in an email. “If it does, we are still on schedule to pass the bill by October if everything continues to go smoothly.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said the bill’s inclusion of a Utilities User Tax (UUT), which allows the CSD to apply a tax on utilities such as water, electricity and gas, will potentially raise the most issues in the hearing next week.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Isla Vista’s situation is so unique. The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V. – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>The bill’s supporters have yet to complete a financial feasibility report to determine whether such a tax is necessary, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“I think that the fear and contention is around the fact that we’re putting this forward before a financial feasibility report,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the UUT is necessary for a CSD in I.V. because it is home to a majority of renters and short-term residents.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista’s situation is so unique,” Schunk said. “The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he believes legislators will not take AB 3 seriously because it lacks community support.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t something that a lot of people seem to be pushing for,” Garshfield said in an email. “I think we might not get support from the state because I.V. hasn’t really proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” the bill will pass despite the possible controversy surrounding the inclusion of the UUT, though the effort will require the support of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“We need to show local support for the unique solutions we’ve put in the bill, like the Utilities User Tax,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, if the bill is killed in the hearing, the establishment of I.V. self-governance may be delayed until the 2020s.</p>\n<p>“If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s. – SBCC Trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said the end of AB 3 would mean the introduction of alternative solutions to Isla Vista “self-determination,” such as pushing the county or university to provide funding or support instead of establishing a CSD.</p>\n<p>“At that point, which I consider to be the unwanted scenario, my and other activists’ efforts will have to become focused on pursuing our community’s right to self-determination through other means,” Schunk said in an email. “Those other means, in many cases, have very little real authority and can do very little at addressing the underlying issues in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he is renting a 12-person van to transport AB 3 supporters next Tuesday evening to Sacramento to lobby for the Wednesday hearing and demonstrate Isla Vista’s support for AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Anyone is welcome to come,” Schunk said in an email. “The broader the community support, the more powerful our sentiment will be.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is fully prepared to “eat his words” if the bill passes and will be happy to have some form of self-governance in I.V. even if it is not the independent cityhood he prefers.</p>\n<p>“I’d be happy to see some form of I.V. self-governance come into effect during my time as a student here,” Garshfield said in an email. “I just think that AB 3 is a half measure that still leaves us under the partial jurisdiction of the county.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sheriff’s Department (SBCSO) deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers were commended at the 46th annual H. Thomas Guerry Awards Ceremony in the Santa Barbara County Administration Building Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Five SBCSO deputies and three UCPD officers were awarded the H. Thomas Guerry Award for valor at the ceremony and several other local law enforcement officials were also celebrated for superior performance. The prestigious award is named after former Santa Barbara police detective H. Thomas Guerry, who was shot and killed in 1970 by two suspects attempting to rob a bar downtown.</p>\n<p>UCPD Corporal Gregory Pierce said despite the unfortunate circumstances, he is honored to attend the ceremony and hopes to bridge an understanding between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>“We’re all honored to be here, but it’s an unfortunate reason that we’re all standing here,” Pierce said. “But taking a positive attitude, building a relationship with the community and understanding what we do on a daily basis, what we’re capable of doing kind of put some closure to this event for the law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>UCPD sergeant Dan Wilson said community members should take preventative measures and reach out to the police if they have mental health concerns about someone.</p>\n<p>“We really need to work on the mental health aspect in our community, because that’s an epidemic that’s really facing our country right now,” Wilson said. “Usually somebody knows something before it happens, but they fail to report it. And, unfortunately, we’re unable to prevent that from happening.”</p>\n<p>According to Pierce, events such as Pizza with Police, Coffee with Cops and UCSB residence hall programs are a good start to communicating with residents and students.</p>\n<p>“I know that our agency at UCSB tends to do a lot more community outreach,” Pierce said. “We have the res hall liaison program, where officers are assigned to those res halls and they provide information and talks on how to be safe in Isla Vista. That’s definitely one that helps us build those relationships.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Pizza with Police is important because it “allows [the police] to be human” and allows the community feel more relaxed around cops.</p>\n<p>“They get to know us by name and they can actually feel comfortable approaching us, and that’s kind of breaking down those barriers because a lot of times, people don’t feel comfortable [so] they’re not going to say anything,” Wilson said. “A lot more students are approaching police officers and having a relationship and talking and you can see it by them saying thank you.”</p>\n<p>According to UCPD Corporal Bradley Prows, open communication must be ensured in I.V. because the police exist to serve the public.</p>\n<p>“We are there to serve them so you have to have an open dialogue back and forth that is a healthy exchange of ideas,” Prows said. “I mean if an officer were to tell you they aren’t interested in what you have to say, you’re looking at a fool.”</p>\n<p>Prows said Chancellor Henry T. Yang is bringing in officers from UCLA, UC Irvine and UC Riverside every weekend to maintain safety on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had that every weekend … officers coming in Thursday through Sunday,” Prows said. “There’s been a huge commitment on it on the part of the chancellor to ensure the safety of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Prows, the argument that there is too much police presence in I.V. has no basis, especially given the string of recent robberies this past week.</p>\n<p>“I think you could have a spirited debate between people saying it’s too much and people who are victims of either nonviolent or violent crimes that would say there’s not enough,” Prows said. “Especially this last week we’ve had three armed robberies, I’d have to argue that we don’t have enough officers.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said he approves of the university’s steps in taking “a bigger interest in the community” by providing alternative events to popular I.V. festivities such as concerts and fairs.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting together on different platforms to try to talk about issues and come up with resolutions,” Wilson said. “I think having different alternatives during these in advance, whether they’re planned or not, like the concerts, places for people to go — it’s the little things that make a big difference.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue

murder</h3>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) held a memorial tree planting Wednesday to honor the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at the school’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>Students and administrators planted sunflowers and six trees to honor each of the six students who passed away last spring. SBCC President Lori Gaskin and two members of SBCC’s Associated Student Government spoke to dedicate the memorial grove. A plaque with the names of the six students sits in the middle of the grove.<br>\nGaskin said the memorial trees represent ongoing remembrance of the six students.</p>\n<p>“It is to honor and remember the victims through tree planting in order to have a permanent symbol of what happened last year,” Gaskin said. “It is for future generations to see so that it can live on in perpetuity and remembrance of those six victims.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, the event is an opportunity to unite Santa Barbara communities.<br>\n“Right now, it is time to work together with UCSB, Isla Vista and the Santa Barbara community, which is more of an opportunity for us to strengthen ties,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said college is a time of “joy, celebration and discovery,” and the victims should not have lost that time.</p>\n<p>“For those opportunities to be shattered is devastating, as it happened to the six young lives,” Gaskin said. “It causes reflection and calls to action for things to change.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government President and second-year undeclared major Colette Brown said the trees create a space to appreciate natural beauty and remember the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think it is necessary for us to use this space not only for something beautiful, but for those individuals who were killed last year in Isla Vista,” Brown said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63155\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63155\" data-attachment-id=\"63155\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/tree-memorial_lorenzo-basilio-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430925421\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"60\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tree Memorial_Lorenzo Basilio-10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63155\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government Vice President of External Affairs and second-year business and administration major Caleb Ransom said the memorial grove will foster unity in support of those who were close to the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think this is crucial for the families and friends of those who have passed away,” Ransom said. “We all mourn and I think this is ultimately important for the community and the colleges because it brings everyone together. It goes to show that we are human and here for a purpose.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Laura Guzman said the dedication event was “positive,” because it brought people together to heal.</p>\n<p>“Victims died, however, people still express their concerns and support by remembering and honoring the victims,” Guzman said. “There is still light at the end of the tunnel and I think it is getting brighter because this beautification will remind us of the strength in unity.”</p>\n<p>Guzman said the strong demonstration of community support is an effective step towards healing the wounds left by last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Even though people are feeling pretty sad right now because we remember the tragedy, I am still thankful for being a part of this,” Guzman said. “I think it is important to remain thankful and give gratitude for the people who care to make a difference in sorrowful times.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A v</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/","id":4704,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4703,4702,4701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders’ Meeting Talks Taxes","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and county administrators gathered for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting Tuesday evening in the I.V.

Clinic building hosted by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office for continued discussions on Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</p>\n<p>During this week’s meeting, attendees discussed recent amendments to clarify how the Community Services District proposed by the bill will function if passed by the State Assembly. If AB 3 passes, a CSD would still require approval in a county-level vote.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said if there is not adequate funding to support a financial feasibility study, it could delay the county-level approval process of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Theoretically, say AB 3 is signed by the governor by October 11, then the County District Board of Supervisors would determine when to put it on the ballot,” Elliott said. “So, say we don’t have the financial feasibility study done by October 11, they will probably wait before they decide to put it on the ballot.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district. – Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elliott said a vote to implement a Utility User’s Tax (UUT), a tax as a percentage of utility bills, would follow approval of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the Assembly Committee on Local Government said William’s office should reintroduce AB 3 if the vote to establish a UUT does not pass.</p>\n<p>“If the tax passes with a two-thirds vote, the District becomes operational and will start providing services,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t pass, the committee recommended putting in a time frame to allow multiple attempts so they suggested ten years, because it’s a nice even number.”</p>\n<p>According to a presentation by Elliott, the CSD would be dissolved after ten years of inactivity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO. – Former A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said a CSD is the best available way to establish self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have concerns about the idea of pursuing a host of alternatives through other channels, when we have a channel right here that seems to be rather unified and, in my opinion, very effective for a lot of good reasons,” Schunk said. “I really have to disagree with the sentiment that this district may not accomplish what we set out to do if the county put it into place.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), an organization which regulates the formation of local government entities, could participate in the CSD approval process through involvement in financial feasibility research.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he supports having separate county-level votes approving a CSD and UUT.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t put the tax in it will only be 50 plus one to pass. With the tax it’s two-thirds,” Abboud said. “I would agree that it shouldn’t be the same just so that it speeds up the process and makes it less complicated it for people.”</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will continue discussion on AB 3 amendments at the I.V. clinic next Tuesday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/","id":4701,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4700,4699,4698],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":25,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
