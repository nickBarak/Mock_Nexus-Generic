The tax would add an additional 8 percent surcharge to five utilities on I.V. residents’ bills: electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services.</p>\n<p>In a report presented at a special meeting on Tuesday, the Community Services District (CSD) presented its first revenue projections. The CSD arrived at the figures by calculating eight percent of all I.V. bills in 2017 for the five utilities.</p>\n<p>Dividing that amount by the number of I.V. residents, 23,096 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217\">according to the 2010 census</a>, means that individuals will each have to pay approximately $30.41 annually.</p>\n<p>The tax figures originally projected the CSD would accrue $834,993, though additional deductions the CSD is still considering would drop the number to $702,444.</p>\n<p>There are two specific deductions the CSD is considering: a state-owned exemption which amounts to $7,300 and a low-income exemption which totals $125,249 of tax savings for residents.</p>\n<p>A low-income exemption would excuse residents from paying the 8 percent tax on gas, water and electricity.</p>\n<p>Residents would be able to qualify for the exemption by providing proof they are enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or Family Electric Rate Assistance programs. They would also need proof they own the electricity utility account enrolled in the assistance program.</p>\n<p>In order to apply for the exemption, residents would have to file an application with the general manager of the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://sbcassessor.com/SampleballotandpollplaceLookup/ballots/bt000009.pdf\">the language readers will see at the </a>voting booth, the tax revenue will be used to fund “local improvements to parking, public safety, lighting, and sidewalks.”</p>\n<p>The language also states that the funds will be used to provide tenant-landlord mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate community facilities and events such as the I.V. Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar or the I.V. Community Center, both of which are behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>The ballot language originally claimed that the tax would accrue $642,000 in funds a year, though the CSD’s preliminary estimate is higher.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82998\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1237702627\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82998\" data-attachment-id=\"82998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/measure-r/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=998%2C324&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"998,324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure r\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=888%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=888%2C288\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above, a summary of the Isla Vista Community Services District’s revenue sources from the CSD’s Tuesday special meeting report.

The report projects that the CSD’s total revenue will reach $932,944 with the passage of the tax and by fully acquiring the $200,000 UCSB has pledged.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

will open in the near future. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">212F Hotpot, which for months has sported a storefront sign at 6533 Trigo Road, will open by the end of May at the latest, owner David Chen told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restaurant will be the first personal hot pot restaurant in the area. While the cuisine is Chinese, the theme is not to be confused with regular Chinese hot pot, which provides patrons with a family-style pot at the middle of the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, 212F Hotpot will give each restaurant-goer a personal pot of boiling soup, so customers can dine individually. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the menu items will be soup-based – broths of beef, seafood and the like will be available to order in a semi-sit-down format. Chen is toying with the idea of takeout, but the idea is to give I.V. residents a spot to sit down and enjoy their dinner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen hasn’t decided the restaurant’s hours of operation. After opening, it will stay open until 10 or 11 p.m., but he might decide to close earlier or later depending on the restaurant’s initial popularity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If customers want to come, we’ll serve them any time,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Chen’s third eatery in the area. He also owns PokeMee, a poke restaurant, and Choppa Rollin’ Ice Cream, a Thai rolled ice cream store, both of which are found on Hollister Avenue in Goleta. The two shops offer niche products in an area mostly bereft of non-generic Asian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen will change the name of PokeMee to Choppa Poke in the near future, due to a name dispute with a poke restaurant in Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal hot pot will provide a “whole new concept” of hot pot cuisine to the community, Chen highlighted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many restaurants in I.V. are staples, some close down quickly after opening. A number of joints have shut down shop in the past few years, including Otaco, El Sitio, La Cantina, Santa Ynez Burrito and Kol’s Cafe — the last of which is the predecessor to 212F Hotpot’s location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the problem is the food itself, some is the type of food,” Chen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hoping to be a staple,” added manager Will Groman, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara just last quarter. Groman worked at PokeMee before Chen hired him to be a part of 212F Hotpot from the ground up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In I.V. there aren’t many places where you can sit down for 30 minutes,” Groman said. “You order and take it to go home. It’d be nice to have an atmosphere where people can come, sit down and be lively.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen moved to Santa Barbara County in 2016 after noticing that the area had no poke restaurants. He used money from his existing e-commerce company to fund the startup costs. Since then, he has launched several restaurants, 212F Hotpot being the third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming months, he said, he plans to open a State Street shop that sells both poke and Thai ice cream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a background in sales, Chen stressed there is no one good way to pitch people on the hot pot joint. Instead, he offered a catch-all line to interested consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s new, so come try it out,” he said. </span></p><div

After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.<em> Courtesy of Isla Vista Trading Post</em></p></div>\n<p>Patrons of the trading post can take three pieces of clothing from the pop-up shops, free of charge.</p>\n<p>The founders see no reason to make a profit off of their passion for thrifting, instead hoping that their “three for free” rule will encourage people to pay their efforts forward and choose to donate their old clothes at a future event if they wish.</p>\n<p>Rothfield, a fourth-year communication major, initially pitched the idea for the trading post as a project for one of her communication classes in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Our project was to come up with something that would help the community, so I pitched this idea for something sustainable and fashion-oriented,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rothfield was inspired by the “free box” in Isla Vista, which are bins full of free clothing outside the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District building.</p>\n<p>The founders of the trading post planned their first pop-up thrift shop during Fall Quarter, but when the Thomas Fire hit Santa Barbara County, plans for the event were abandoned.</p>\n<p>The delay, as well as Rothfield’s graduation from UC Santa Barbara, left the future of the trading post up in the air.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sofia Willis, who now runs IVTP with Forsell, wanted to bring thrifting to Isla Vista, but lacked the means.</p>\n<p>Willis, a second-year philosophy and sociology double major, initially got involved in thrifting through the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB), taking to the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page to round up clothing donations.</p>\n<p>Through Facebook she met Rothfield and Forsell, whose vision for the Isla Vista Trading Post matched her own and the three branched off to reinvigorate the project.</p>\n<p>“I wanted this to be not just about the environment, but also community, and fashion and self-expression, which is the direction [the project] was going in as well,” Willis said.</p>\n<p>To reach a larger scope of the surrounding community, the trading post decided to host its pop-up shop in Isla Vista rather than on campus. After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.</p>\n<p>With shops hosted by student artists and vintage clothing curators, Rothfield thought the trading post would be a natural addition to the market.</p>\n<p>Forsell and Willis agree that they want to educate people about the human rights violations in the fast fashion industry and cited sustainability as the primary goal of the trading post.</p>\n<p>“We like to say that the fast fashion industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world,” Forsell said.</p>\n<p>They said, however, that their mission does not have a political agenda.</p>\n<p>The organization is comprised of approximately 15 dedicated students, five of whom hold official administrative positions. The volunteers meet on Wednesday nights to plan thrifting events, collect donations and postulate about the future of the rapidly-growing trading post.</p>\n<p>Ultimately one of the main goals of the Isla Vista Trading Post is to normalize thrift shopping and to welcome all people who are interested. Willis believes that thrift shopping currently belongs to a very specific group of people, which she hopes to destigmatize.</p>\n<p>“Right now it seems like thrifting belongs to a very niche group, sort of, and it’s not like everybody thrifts because it’s fashionable or cool, it’s kind of just a niche group that does it,” Forsell explained.</p>\n<p>Willis and Forsell said the next major step is to apply for nonprofit status in order to receive funding from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>\n<p>They are hopeful that with this funding they will be able to buy a storage unit, as they have currently been storing the enormous amounts of leftover clothes in their cars.</p>\n<p>While the trading post is a nonprofit organization, Willis, Forsell, Rothfield and the other members of their team have all paid out of pocket to get the organization off the ground. Willis said she sees the organization as an “investment” and hopes of one day buying a van and a storage unit.</p>\n<p>They also hope to plan a raffle for some of the high value items they have received as donations and would like to host an art show in conjunction with student artists and local businesses.</p>\n<p>In the short term, Willis and Forsell are looking forward to collaborating with WORD Magazine, Surfrider Foundation and the sustainability chairs of Greek life organizations as part of the Greeks Go Green initiative in order to bring the trading post to as many places as they can.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to expand past Isla Vista and inspire other college campuses and communities,” Forsell said. “And if this generation can get used to trading clothes, then future generations will start doing that.”</p>\n<p>“‘Remember when people used to buy clothes instead of trading them?’ That’s my dream, to be able to say that to my kids,” Willis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the May 3 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Idle Riot will be playing this Friday night, with Fencer opening for them at 9 p.m. The theme of the night is “Dilfs and Milfs,” so attendees are urged to dress up as their favorite “dilf/milf.” Both are rock bands; Idle Riot is based in Isla Vista, while Fencer will be coming up from L.A. to perform. The show will be held at 6610 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FIND MEANING IN GLEANING </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never heard the term gleaning before; gleaning is a term that means picking produce from harvest that would otherwise be unpicked and perish. Join Zero Waste Committee, FoodCycling and Environmental Affairs Board for their first gleaning event of the quarter this Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They will be taking students to glean in the Montecito community. Carpooling will be arranged.

A light breakfast will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>HIKE TO THE SEVEN FALLS</strong></p>\n<p>Stretch your legs with Environmental Affairs Board on a hike to Seven Falls this Sunday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The trail is one of the easier hikes, spanning three miles and multiple waterfalls. Depending on conditions, there may even be a natural waterslide, WHAT????!!!! Organizers ask that those interested in participating fill out a short Google form that can be found on the event page. Go have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>YA LIKE BRUNCH? YA LIKE YOGA?</strong></p>\n<p>Grab your yoga mat and head over to the Isla Vista Food Cooperative at 9:45 a.m. this Sunday for their monthly event, Beach Brunch Yoga. The event includes an hour-long yoga class on the bluffs overlooking the ocean followed by a light brunch. This month, the brunch will be set up as a “build a bowl” where participants can create an açai bowl with granola and superfood toppings. The brunch theme will vary each month of the year. Participants must pay a $5 fee at the Co-Op from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. any day before the event to sign up. Those who do not show up on time at 10 a.m. may lose their spot unless they call ahead of time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily

CSD was created on Nov. 9, 2016, after the passage of Measure E with an overwhelming 87 percent of the vote, but the new government was deprived of financial stability when Measure F failed to garner the necessary 66.67 percent of the vote, falling short by about six percent.</p>\n<p>Measure R is essentially a second attempt to pass a user utility tax (UUT), the same goal Measure F sought to accomplish in 2016. The ballot language for the measure has changed since the UUT’s first appearance at the polls, though only slightly.</p>\n<p>While on the 2016 ballot, Measure F included the contingency that the UUT would go into effect with the creation of a then-nebulous CSD. Measure R now lists the particular services the tax would fund.</p>\n<p>According to the ballot language registered with the county’s clerk-recorder, the UUT would explicitly fund any of the following services: improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>The tax could also be used to provide tenant mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate facilities like the Community Room the CSD currently meets at for its twice-monthly board meetings and the burgeoning Community Center.</p>\n<p>In order to place Measure R on the June primary ballot, the CSD Board of Directors first voted on the language citizens would see on their voting slips and then submitted the proposed question to the County of Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which later approved the phrasing at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the CSD has found its organizational framework, hired legal counsel, expanded the Community Service Organization’s escort services, piloted a tenant mediation program with the Santa Barbara Legal Aid Foundation and hired an interim General Manager, all while operating mainly on a $200,000 donation from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand said the key difference between the 2016 vote and this year’s is that the CSD has found its footing, proving it can do a lot with a little.</p>\n<p>Support for Measure R is mounting within student activist networks and some government circles. UC Santa Barbara’s Campus Democrats began campaigning for the measure last Monday, while the “Yes on Measure R” campaign has been active since mid-March.</p>\n<p>While the I.V. Recreation and Parks District has not made an official statement supporting the measure, Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann issued a statement on Wednesday “strongly in support” of Measure R. Hartmann has personally contributed $6,000 toward the campaign and will actively fundraise and canvass for its passage, she said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the measure’s passage would allow for the CSD to thrive and provide effective services to its unique demographic.</p>\n<p>“Due to its great density, diversity, poverty level, and demographics dominated by a young student population … Isla Vista has an even greater need for services and infrastructure than other unincorporated areas in the County,” Hartmann said in her statement.</p>\n<p>While proponents of the tax have sought to spread their message through door-to-door canvassing and tabling, opponents have voiced their displeasure toward the tax<sub>,</sub> primarily through flyers.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, treasurer of anti-UUT group Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that the group has been distributing flyers advocating for a “no” vote on the measure.</p>\n<p>The flyers claim that I.V. residents’ taxes are far too high and calls on them to voice their dissent. The exact cost of the UUT for individual residents is still undetermined, according to CSD Secretary and Director Spencer Brandt. The CSD plans to present a revenue estimate at their next board meeting, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he is against the measure’s passage because he believes the I.V. government does not need additional funding “to do what they have already done.” He also said services like tenant mediation duplicate already available services like the Community Housing Office and other resources offered by UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/","id":4313,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4312,4311,4310],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia Attendance, Medical Emergencies Rise","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Deltopia-by-Sicheng-Wang-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Deltopia-by-Sicheng-Wang-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a forecast with a low probability of rainfall, this year’s Deltopia weekend saw a 25 percent increase in attendance from 2017.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a forecast with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-06/rain-unlikely-for-deltopia-weekend/\">low probability of rainfall</a>, this year’s Deltopia weekend saw a 25 percent increase in attendance from 2017.</p>\n<p>Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party held primarily on Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista, drew approximately 10,000 people this year, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO). This is an uptick from last year’s estimated attendance of between 6,000 and 8,000 people.</p>\n<p>There were 56 citations, 25 arrests and 25 medical transports this year by both SBSO and the UC Police Department (UCPD), according to preliminary numbers from the Sheriff’s office.

There was one incident involving an opioid-related overdose, during which SBSO administered Narcan.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, there were two separate cases where a partygoer fell off a balcony due to intoxication. Neither incident resulted in major injuries.</p>\n<p>Two of the arrests that occurred on Saturday involved <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-09/two-handguns-confiscated-over-deltopia-weekend/\">handguns</a>. In the first incident SBSO arrested Briton Barge, 23, after he allegedly used a 0.40 caliber pistol to threaten two victims while searching for his stolen backpack.</p>\n<p>SBSO also arrested Tristian Gilford, 24, after Gilford was pulled over for having “faulty lighting equipment” on his car. Police officers then found a .25 caliber pistol hidden inside of his car and arrested him.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO, the crowds began dwindling around 6 p.m. when the Outdoor Festival Ordinance, which bans any live or recorded music heard outside residences, went into effect. The crowds eventually dissipated when students left I.V. to attend The Warm Up concert at the Thunderdome sponsored by Associated Students Program Board.</p>\n<p>“This year we did see more out-of-towners, and we did obviously see an increase in medical transports,” Hoover said. “But for the most part, people were pretty respectful of law enforcement and there weren’t any major problems other than the medical transports we talked about.”</p>\n<p>According to arrest logs from April 5 to April 8, out-of-towners made up 49 percent of Deltopia arrests. Here’s a breakdown of all the arrests including age, gender and offense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 650px; height: 560px; border: 1px solid grey;\" src=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/Deltopia_Arrests_2018.html\" width=\"800\" height=\"150\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Phi Do / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>Most of the arrests occurred on Del Playa Drive, where law enforcement arrested 10 people.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1kbUj0bnkak9PTGpmRvHRllXED7STTLpj\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></center>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>Jay Freeman, director for the I.V. Community Services District (CSD), said that with the exception of several parking restrictions, it was “a day like any other.”</p>\n<p>The day after Deltopia festivities, 60 volunteers assembled at Adopt-A-Block’s annual Deltopia Cleanup Sunday morning to pick up 776 pounds of trash. According to Adopt-A-Block Supervisor Raymond Willefert, the amount of street waste he observed this year was similar to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia has certainly quieted down in the last few years, and fortunately we’re not seeing widespread trashing of the community and environment on the scale that was experienced prior to 2015,” Willefert said in an email.</p>\n<p>“There was a significant amount of trash on Del Playa Drive this morning when I got to work. The 6600 block in particular was hit pretty hard, but fortunately nothing we couldn’t handle,” he explained.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university spent between $25,000 and $30,000 on ads to deter out-of-towners from attending Deltopia. In previous years, the university has spent up to $40,000.</p>\n<p>The university also spent approximately $5,000 to put up fencing on El Colegio Road. The university faced backlash from students and the CSD regarding their decision to put up fencing this year, despite a formal request from the CSD to reconsider.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand said the CSD coordinated with local law enforcement and had a contract with the UCPD to deploy Community Service Officers (CSOs) during the day to help keep people safe.</p>\n<p>“I’m very glad that it was a relatively safe event,” Bertrand said. “On that note, I’m really happy to see a continued reduction in arrests and citations. However, I am concerned about this year’s increase in medical calls, and it just shows us how important it is to continue to work to make this event safer.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that moving forward, there should be considerations about creating a “more sustainable event,” which brings together locals, community organizations and businesses.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we have a bunch of people who are roaming around on Del Playa with no plans,” Bertrand said. “If we can bring some more fun and safe activities to Isla Vista on this day and really incorporate local businesses into it, I think that we can have a much safer and more positive event.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div
