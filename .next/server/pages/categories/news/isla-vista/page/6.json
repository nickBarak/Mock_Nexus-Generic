drunk food this weekend and treat your body to the vitamins it deserves. Sponsored by the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, you can take advantage of this scrumptious produce-tasting event anytime this Saturday from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. At the event, you’ll find a medley of fresh greens and delectable, locally-grown fruits. We know you don’t take a daily multivitamin, so please, eat an apple.</span></p>\n<p><b>Free Yoga Series</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free yoga, sunshine and the stretch of a lifetime — all at your disposal thanks to this free yoga series sponsored by your Associated Students! The event will take place this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Pardall Center, located at 6550 Pardall Road. If you don’t have one, mats will be provided, but please bring your own if you do! All skill levels are welcome, so there’s no shame if you can’t touch those toes. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lord of the Rings Marathon</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your type of marathon doesn’t involve sweat or running, then you’ve come to the right place. This Friday, Magic Lantern Films will be putting on a twelve-hour “Lord of The Rings” Marathon. The showing begins Friday at 7 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m. For only $4, patrons will have access to the entire series, as well as snacks and caffeinated beverages. If you’re okay with a sick stomach and sore eyes, you really must be a fan of Gollum — so don’t let him down!

Then this might be the right opportunity for you. Set yourself straight this weekend and join the Isla Vista Surfriders in an effort to pick those Natty Daddys out of the sand. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. this Sunday at Devereux Beach. If you know your volunteer credit is going to take a backseat later on this quarter, then don’t forget to bring your volunteer hour form to get credit for all your hard work. If your last weekend was particularly rough, we can pretend that didn’t happen. Weekend one truly started now, just don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p><b>BUST DOWN WITH BIKO</b></p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of neck cramps and stained white vans, then Biko Garage is no stranger to you. Wacko, Lead, Powerslave, The Dory’s and Cruelty will be putting the noise ordinance to work so you’ll have no reason to wallow in boredom tomorrow night. The event takes place this Thursday from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and is hosted by Biko Garage, located at 6612 Sueno Road. These fine musicians, from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles, have been shredding strings and breaking cymbals all along Southern California. Beer die is a weekend sport, so burn some real calories tomorrow night and forget that you have a section the next morning.</p>\n<p><b>GET DOWN AND DIRTY</b></p>\n<p>This Saturday, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, is hosting an event that you absolutely cannot scrap. The County Composting Workshop, held in conjunction with the Public Works department of Santa Barbara and the UC Santa Barbara Department of Public Worms, will be teaching attendees how to properly manage their backyard compost. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and will teach you what foods can be composted as well as how to properly compost food. The event is only hosted once a year, so don’t miss out! If you stay the whole time, you’ll also be eligible to win your very own worm-composting bin! Now who wouldn’t want that?</p>\n<p><b>COP SOME FRESH THREADS</b></p>\n<p>Have bad spending habits and a bad eye for clothing? Look no further. Santa Barbara-based collector Andi Mondugno has pre-selected all the lovely attire set at painless prices. Swing by the Isla Vista Food Co-op at 6575 Seville Road this Sunday anytime from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and peruse the visually-delectable array of clothes, shoes and accessories. The Lazy Eye Pop-up, as it is officially called, is a great opportunity to freshen up that spring-cleaned wardrobe with sensible threads from up-cycled clothing.</p>\n<p><b>JAM TO (ROCK)FIRE BEATS</b></p>\n<p>Are you a fan of NOVA? No, not the PBS show. NOVA Nights at Rockfire Grill will fill the burger bastillon this Friday from 9 p.m. to 12 p.m. with a medley of dance-friendly music.

CSD discussed the resolution at several board meetings before it passed on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Resolution No. 19-7 calls for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors to recognize the Chumash people’s historical and ongoing ties to I.V., also known as Anisq’oyo, through an acknowledgement at the beginning of all meetings.</p>\n<p>Anisq’oyo, part of the home of the Chumash people, encompasses the land that I.V. and UC Santa Barbara both reside on.</p>\n<p>I.V CSD staff members and Board President Spencer Brandt worked with Mia Lopez, a representative of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, to draft the acknowledgement and learn more about the heritage of the Chumash people.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just recognizing the past, but acknowledging those of the present and our future. We need to educate our community about the forgotten history that is our history,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also started using a similar land acknowledgement in graduation ceremonies and convocations for new students, according to Lopez. Multiple departments have begun to do the same at the beginning of their meetings as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s just incredibly important, I think, that we can serve as a model for something that local governments can do in whatever small way to try to do our part to rewrite history and not be silencing voices, both of the past and the present,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Annette Cordero, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, explained how vital it is for governing bodies such as I.V. CSD to set an example for the rest of the community to remember the history of the people who occupied it for centuries.</p>\n<p>“It is healing for us. It does our hearts and our souls good to have this kind of recognition. On behalf of our, as we like to say for seven generations, our children and the children yet to come, this will have a meaning for them, so thank you,”  Cordero said.</p>\n<p>The resolution was adopted with a small amendment clarifying that the acknowledgement be recited at all meetings of the I.V. CSD, not just regular meetings. The resolution was passed with a 6-0 vote in favor and was met with a round of applause. Director George Thurlow was absent from the meeting.</p>\n<p>The full acknowledgement of the Chumash people and Anisq’oyo can be read below:</p>\n<p><i>“Before we begin, we would like to acknowledge the Chumash people, who are the traditional custodians of this land. We pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present, and future who call this place, Anisq’oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home. We are proud to continue their tradition of coming together and growing as a community. We thank the Chumash community for their stewardship and support, and we look forward to strengthening our ties as we continue our relationship of mutual respect and understanding.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Look no further, as this once-a-year opportunity will let you cleanse both your sins and the gnarly, natty-daddy ridden streets of Del Playa. Don’t worry about having nothing to clean – the students of UCSB will keep you very busy. Join Adopt-A-Block and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) to help bring the pavement back to life. The clean up will take place this Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. To participate, sign up at the IVRPD office on 961 Embarcadero del Mar. Gloves, buckets and trash grabbers will all be provided to you free of cost. You might not be able to clean <i>everything</i>, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Not Bombs</strong></p>\n<p>Food not bombs is back with another opportunity to cook a free meal for your community! Even if Food Network wasn’t your go-to in the days before Netflix, don’t hesitate to dip your toes in the cooking world to make some food for a good cause! The event takes place this Sunday from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., you’ll begin cooking preparations at 777 Camino Pescadero. At 5 p.m., you’ll serve food to the community at Little Acorn Park and return to 777 Camino Pescadero at 6:15 p.m. to clean some dishes. They are in regular need of volunteers, so do the community a favor and brandish that ladle. There is no sign up – all you have to do is show up. Think of it like crashing a class.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineers Without Borders</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be real, we all know Hana Kitchen probably cooks better than your housemates. If you’d like to treat yourself with a meal out, you can easily kill two weeds with the same whacker by showing up to Hana Kitchen anytime this Friday from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some of the proceeds of your chicken bowl will be donated in support of the Engineers Without Borders project. With chapters in Rwanda and Kenya, the Engineers Without Borders plan on taking a trip to Panama this summer, so rip those chopsticks apart and get smackin’!</p>\n<p><strong>MAPAS</strong></p>\n<p>MAPAS, or Making Adventures Possible for all Students, is hosting a kayaking event this Friday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Fluency in swimming is recommended, but nobody will look twice if you show up in your floaties. In order to participate, check in at the UCSB Adventure Program station near Campus Point to pick up a kayak and celebrate the start of this glorious Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>SBKlub</strong></p>\n<p>If blasting Billboard’s Top 100 songs for 24 hours straight isn’t your kind of gig, then SBKlub might offer the perfect Deltopia alternative. If you like food, dancing, the beach or honestly anything, then this event might grab your eye – or your tongue – depending on how much of a palate you have for potluck.

Naloxone is a medication that temporarily blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and keeps the opioid from being able to attach to those receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the training, free Naloxone nasal spray kits were handed out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About 45 students and community members were present at the first training on Tuesday. The second training will be held on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The start of the trainings follows a public health announcement sent out by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead on March 20. The announcement said that in the past few weeks, “three Isla Vista residents suffered from an apparent overdose of opioids,” and while two were revived with the use of Naloxone, the third did not survive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>UCSB’s Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada later clarified to the <em>Nexus </em>that the overdose resulting in death did not occur in I.V. , and the individual was not an I.V.  resident, as had been stated in the announcement sent out to all UCSB students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trainings, however, were not held as a result of the most recent overdoses, according to Angie Bryan, the recovery program manager and a recovery specialist for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program. In fact, planning for the trainings has been in the works for a little over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan first proposed an overdose prevention protocol to Student Health during March 2018, and the standing order was approved by the director of behavioral health in October of 2018, Bryan said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan was approved for a Naloxone grant through the California Department of Public Health’s Naloxone Distribution Project in November 2018, and received a supply of Naloxone in December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan led Tuesday’s Naloxone training in the I.V. Community Room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been a counselor at UCSB for almost 15 years,” Bryan said at the beginning of the training. “Naloxone is something I’m really passionate about in terms of making sure that we get it into as many hands and homes as possible because I think it’s important for students to feel empowered to do something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Students are the ones that are gonna be there in those first moments that an overdose might happen.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan discussed preventative measures that students could take, such as using fentanyl test strips and various drug testing kits that can test for a range of substances, along with how to reduce the risk of using certain substances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She then asked attendees for what they think signs of an overdose are, to which attendees responded with an individual being unresponsive, having pinpoint pupils and having discoloration of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But even after Naloxone is administered, 911 still needs to be called, Bryan explained.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan demonstrated the use of Naloxone by asking an attendee to volunteer to lie on the ground acting as an individual who overdosed. She then went through the hypothetical motions of using the nasal spray on the volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan said that all law enforcement officers and paramedics in I.V. carry Naloxone, including UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol, and emphasized that a person who calls law enforcement in response to an overdose cannot be charged with a misdemeanor crime of possession or being under the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, that is not the case for felony-type charges, Bryan said. For example, if one has an excessive amount of drugs that seems like an intent to sell, law enforcement could investigate that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jeike Meijer, the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), collaborated with Bryan on the trainings after Bryan received the Naloxone grant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We sat down, we had a meeting, we kind of tried to think about when would be the best time to have [the trainings], and we thought before Deltopia was the best,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer said preparing students for overdose situations as opposed to just discouraging drug use is a more effective route for keeping students safe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s really important to not just say ‘don’t do drugs,’ because people will do it, and it’s good to know how to be safe in the case of an emergency,” Meijer said. “Even if you don’t think that you’ll be using opioids, you might have a neighbor, or a housemate [who does].”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer added that the public health announcement sent out to UCSB students which mentioned the recent opioid overdoses reiterates the necessity of Naloxone trainings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping that conversations and de-stigmatization… will allow people to get the help they need.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Bryan, Meijer also hopes to help with more Naloxone trainings in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Angie had all of the information and all of the knowledge to bring,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s always people working on projects and there’s always someone who’s going to know more than you, and you have to know when to step back and let them take the wheel but give them all of the power you have,” Meijer said. “I don’t know how to do the trainings, but I can give the space.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said at the launch on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt recalled the first time he visited I.V. with his family and said it was “clear from the beginning that this was a place that was special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was also clear what my parents’ opinion of it was, which was that it’s weird that there are mattresses lying on the corner, and that there’s trash in the gutters,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all know, standing here today, both as folks who have lived in Isla Vista and those who have been coming here for years, that’s not what Isla Vista is really about. But it does say something about the fact that there is a lot of quality of life issues that can be improved here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt hopes to appease these concerns through the use of SeeClickFix. By using the app as a mobile steward, users can help keep the streets of I.V. clean simply with their phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt noted that there’s been a “rise in rhetoric” in the county that has dehumanized houseless people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really think that in Isla Vista, we here can be a model for trying to solve these problems and help them get back on their feet rather than pretending that if we just push things out of sight, out of mind, that the issue doesn’t exist,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who also spoke at the launch Sunday, took a moment to acknowledge Cesar Chavez’s birthday, and the “community building behaviors” that he demonstrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann referenced the <a href=\"https://streetsteam.org/index\">Downtown Streets Team</a> in the Bay Area, which works toward “ending homelessness by restoring the dignity and rebuilding the lives of unhoused men and women,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They first did a survey of homeless people and found that it’s not being cold, it’s not being hungry, it’s being invisible. That’s the hardest thing about being homeless,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this program allows really a triple bottom line: to give people jobs and get them engaged, it makes your community better and it makes each one of us more connected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Lydick, beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista, said the program was going through the final stages of hiring at the moment. She anticipates bringing on five to seven people to work on graffiti abatement and other beautification initiatives in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers on Sunday went to work tackling the first few requests sent in by I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud to clean up the I.V. Community Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud initially utilized SeeClickFix in 2012, when he worked in Associated Students. Back then, he said, the program was much simpler, and there was no designated group working to fix the problems.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working on county issues and trying to figure out how we can make Isla Vista better with no local government back then,” he said. “We’d see what people put in and we’d try to work on them each without a coherent system and without dedicated staff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the I.V. CSD was looking for ways to launch the beautification program, they considered simpler options, like Google Forms, but knew that it wouldn’t give them the ability to collect the data that they wanted to, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they reached out to SeeClickFix, the board found it to be the most effective and reasonably priced option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the district spent approximately $5,700 for a one-year subscription, which included the district with two accounts, one for Abboud and one for Lydick, and the support of the SeeClickFix team in setting up and managing the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service has improved exponentially since Abboud first used it when he was an undergraduate, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before it was [a] very text-based website…I don’t even think it had a GPS,” he said. “It was brand new.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the program is much more user-friendly, he said, and the company has helped the I.V. CSD set up the front end of their app and design a workflow system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud also noted that it has been helpful to hear from the company about how other cities have developed their apps. For the I.V. CSD, one of the most important aspects of the app is its ability to collect data on the kind of work requests it is receiving and how many of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the long term if we had that data accumulate, we’ll just know better in terms of how we’re spending our money and what we’re getting done,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the work orders are limited to graffiti, trash, vandalism and lighting issues for now, the board hopes to expand it to include fixing potholes and uneven sidewalks, and even potentially partnering with UC Santa Barbara to collect work orders for on-campus problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll do things like that in the future, but we wanted to launch with what we can, with a minimum viable product, which is this beautification kind of stuff, and then we’ll move towards other areas in the future,” Abboud said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The shop, located at 6549 Pardall Rd., debuted on Tuesday and is both the newest and only barbershop in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making the decision to open a second shop in I.V., Ramirez took a grassroots style approach to best figure out the location of his second shop, asking students in the community about their thoughts on having a barbershop in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I came out here, there was no barbershop, so I was like, ‘Geesh, where are these kids going [for a haircut]?’ So I started talking to kids, asking them where they get their haircut … [I found out that] a lot of them wait to go back home to get their haircut because there’s nowhere to go, and they don’t trust anybody,” Ramirez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the lack of barber shops may have posed an inconvenience to residents in the past, Ramirez believes his new shop in I.V. will remedy these problems by offering a prime location in I.V. as well as a unique customer experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For $25, many shops offer quality haircuts, but not many offer a quality experience, which Ramirez finds to be a defining characteristic in successful barbershops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accompany the debut of his new shop, Ramirez opted to include a pool table, multiple flat-screen TVs, back massagers and refreshments for patrons — all of which he is confident will contribute to the “experience” of coming to his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Getting a haircut, you shouldn’t have to be like, ‘Oh, I have to get a haircut,’ you should be stoked to get a haircut. You get to come, hangout, get here an hour early, watch the game,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more than a barbershop. It’s an experience, and that’s what we’re providing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other ideas, Ramirez plans to make use of the large white walls surrounding the inside of the shop, flirting with the idea of featuring student-generated art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the amenities, Ramirez’s idea of the barbershop “experience” did not occur to him overnight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he began working as a barber, Ramirez used to frequent barbershops as often as once a week, where he was attracted to its overall atmosphere and ambiance.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86655\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86655\" data-attachment-id=\"86655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/barbershop-debut-sparks-new-buzz-in-i-v/barber-shop-iv_ida-kazerani_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1428&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1428\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Barber Shop IV_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ramirez wants his barbershop to be a place where people come to have a good time. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was the type of guy, back then, who’d get a haircut once a week because I liked going to the barbershop. I liked hanging out, I liked talking with the boys and watching the games,”  he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With multiple shops of his own, Ramirez aims to replicate the same qualities that initially attracted him to become a regular at barbershops he frequented before he began cutting hair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cutting hair in high school, Ramirez was formally introduced to the barbershop world when he was 20, after his best friend convinced him to get his barber license and work at his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started at a shop in Pismo Beach, came out to Santa Barbara, cut hair at a shop called Montecito Barbers, was there for five years, broke off and built my own shop. And now we’re here, number two,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently dividing his time between both locations, Ramirez used to spend all of his time at the Montecito location after opening it in 2010. Things were going smoothly for Ramirez until the massive flood ravaged through Montecito last January, making it impossible for him and his barbers to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than waiting it out, Ramirez devised a plan to work around the flooding by setting up a pop-up shop in the back room of a wine store.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were out of work and the village was shut down, so we did a pop-up shop over at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie Slone Wines. We had this little space in the back where we put up four chairs, people came in and got their haircut … it was just a cool thing for the community to come together and help everybody out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses such as Ramirez’s, mudslides can have a devastating impact on revenue, keeping customers away and making barbers unable to reach the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the pop-up shop helped Ramirez appreciate the power of community, something he hopes to carry with him to his new location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you put a barber shop in, you become a hub of the town … We like to integrate ourselves into the community, we like to do things, have events, after-hour events,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna do as much for the students as possible — this shop is for the students.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We are already looking into expansion… We are actually looking at a Hollywood shop, so we are in the works of getting that set up,” Gabriel English, general manager of Mojo, said.</p>\n<p>According to English, the Hollywood expansion would be in collaboration with Mojo’s business partners, who would also like to start another store in Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Mojo’s success can be partly attributed to the variety of Asian food and drink on the menu. Aside from the typical drinks that one would expect at a boba shop, Mojo also entices customers by offering an ever-changing assortment of Asian fusion snacks, including popcorn chicken, spicy Korean wings and kimchi fries.</p>\n<p>“The latest thing we are thinking about adding to the snacks section is fried cheese wontons. It’s a personal recipe of mine, and has a lot of vegetables and cheese inside it,” English said.</p>\n<p>Customers are attracted to the store by the welcoming environment, as well as the employees’ upbeat nature and passion about boba.</p>\n<p>One such employee is Jeene Yim, a second-year art and biology double major who works as a tea specialist at Mojo. Yim began working at Mojo when it opened last summer, and feels that it makes up for the lack of quality Asian food in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am passionate about boba and I am passionate about my culture,” Yim said. “I wanted to see more Asian culture in I.V.. We do have a lot of Asian food places in I.V., but I really didn’t feel it was good… I really liked boba, and this is the reason I was really excited to start working here.”</p>\n<p>Five months later, Yim has found a sense of community within the walls of the Mojo kitchen, a community that she feels shines through to customers everyday.</p>\n<p>“We have a desire to bring good boba to I.V. so we are always trying to improve ourselves and bring out the best drinks. The close knit community in the back between our workers shows through, and that’s what makes us different.”</p>\n<p>To Yim and countless other UCSB students, Mojo has become a reliable destination for high quality boba.</p>\n<p>“Everytime I’m walking on campus, I hear someone say ‘I want boba, do you want to go to Mojo?’ and I feel like before that, there wasn’t really a certain spot that they would say. When I hear that it makes me happy. I am so proud to work here,” Yim said.</p>\n<p>Mojo Teahouse is located at 6578 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 issue of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
