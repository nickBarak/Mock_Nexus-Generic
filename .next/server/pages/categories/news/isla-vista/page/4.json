Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) board members, county officials and I.V. residents gathered at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar to celebrate the new Isla Vista Community Center’s soft opening. The hard opening date has yet to be released, but I.V. CSD board members are hoping to hold an  official opening sometime between January and March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the February 1970 I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank burning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here celebrating how far we’ve come because it wasn’t that long ago, this building was about to fall over,” said I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no current activities or initiatives are slated for the community center, Brandt said he was interested in using the space to run a variety of programs. Potential ways in which residents may be able to use the space include English classes, homework help for school children, computer literacy classes, yoga classes and a litany of other similar programs, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD paid the Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) $177,000, using funds obtained by a tax on all I.V. residents’ utilities, to manage the community center for one year, according to Lori Goodman, executive director of IVYP. Goodman added that approximately $150,000 of the money will be used to pay its two full-time staff members, while the rest is for potential programs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The County of Santa Barbara paid for the majority of renovations to the building, spending $1,320,000 to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, build two bathrooms and install a kitchen. About $400,000 of that money came from the county’s general fund, according to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann; the rest came from the federal government through Community Development Block Grants, which Hartmann said made the project possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on community feedback, the I.V. CSD is planning additional renovations to the building, including covering the cement ground of the center with hardwood floor. The district is also looking into grants which could further fund renovations, according to Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space has always been a hub for the community of Isla Vista back when I came here in the 60s,” said I.V. CSD Board Member Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, who used to run his church out of the building.  “One of the reasons our community kind of flailed, is because we didn’t have a community center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soft opening inspired Carmen Lodise, who lived in Isla Vista for 30 years and was one of the original activists fighting for a community center, to come from his home in Mexico to witness what he had been wanting to see for decades. Lodise is also the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wonderful. It brought tears to my eyes,” Lodise said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to open the center began in the 1970s, when the building that now houses the Isla Vista Clinic was sold, prompting activists to seek a new space where everyone in the community could congregate, according to Lodise’s book. The calls for a community center would go unfulfilled until the county bought the community center building, formerly a church and bank, in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2012</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD wants more community input on possible uses for the community center before committing to any specific programming, according to Brandt. Diana Collins Puente floated the idea that UC Santa Barbara professors could use the community center for class space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a litany of historical hiccups and delays, the community center — long awaited by many — marks a milestone in the eyes of a town that is eager to put such a facility to use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been a gleam in people’s eyes for decades, but it really took a lot at the last minute to get this done,” Hartmann said during a speech.</span></p><div

Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden. </span><em>Britta Good / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an open-source transformational arts and music festival</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, first introduced the idea for a spring festival during Deltopia to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Tuesday’s meeting, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt expressed the board’s sentiments that Deltopia in its current state, a fundamentally disorganized event that draws thousands of out-of-towners, creates a public safety concern for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQrErSI9EG7M_swcZiaWwgXZE0SA\">Deltopia 2019</a> saw 94 citations, 38 arrests, 19 medical transports and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/police-arrest-two-deltopia-visitors-on-armed-robbery-charges/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595548000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHa24jfKBR84l_Epw29OokNZ08eXw\">one serial robbery</a> — causing the month of April to have the highest number of arrests in comparison to previous months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deltopia, as it exists, is not a safe environment. We see a spike in physical assaults, in sexual assaults. We see a spike in medical transports as a result of alcohol and drugs,” Brandt said at the meeting on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our board’s thought has always been to provide people with a fun alternative where the community has the ability to plan the event, plan the content of the event and have a better handle on what the security presence looks like that we can change the overall feel to be a much safer event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Proposal-V2-Includes-Budget-Site-Map-Security-Plan-IV-April-Event-2020-4.pdf\">current proposal</a> has the festival centered in the I.V. Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden featuring local breweries. The plan also includes detailed information regarding local community collaboration, security and the budget for the overall project, with expenses totalling $184,850.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire board unanimously expressed concern over the price tag of the event. According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD, there are two main options to cover the cost of the event in the budget: a UCSB grant, or the $100,000 reserve allocation currently in the budget. UCSB can grant $93,000 under one condition — the university must reach an agreement with the I.V. CSD as to what the expenses are for. However, Director George Thurlow expressed doubts as to whether UCSB would be willing to fund a community festival versus placing the money directly into public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ways to cover the cost of the festival could include sponsorships from local businesses and funding from the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD). Carlos Lopez, chairperson for the IVRPD, attended the meeting and said the IVRPD Board of Directors is willing to negotiate partially funding the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lopez also suggested a system of pre-registration for the festival where people could sign up online for a QR code that would grant them access to the event. A safety agreement and confirmation of residence in I.V. would accompany the QR code to deter outsiders from attending the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, possible sources of revenue could also come from local sponsorships and the beer garden. Tickets could be sold for the beer garden, in the style of a beer tasting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will also be foregoing the addition of food trucks to the festival — something they predicted would cause pushback from local businesses and go against their vision of a community-controlled event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel emphasized the Safety, Security and Harm Reduction Plan of the proposal to better respond to the annual problems Deltopia brings. It includes the Guardian Team, a security service “with focus on de-escalation, harm reduction, and crisis management,” <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardianteam.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1c8D18DVtMBpd6p5IRgQgFRpfKw\">according to its website</a>, as well as a large medical team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we really pride ourselves on at Lucidity is we have a very, very well-staffed medical team on site. If anybody has any immediate emergency, we have the ability to support them right there and then,” Marvel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a proposal to end the event around 4 p.m. to funnel people toward UCSB’s campus event, The Warm Up, which typically begins at 6 p.m., Alan Avila, co-founder and head of security at Lucidity, said he is willing to negotiate to make the security and medical teams available until 10 p.m. or midnight should a situation arise where they are needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the festival’s budget still remains the primary concern for the directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have any of you electeds gone out in the community and said, ‘This is going to cost 180k of your utility user [tax], [and] you’re paying [for] it?’” Thurlow asked the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand echoed Thurlow’s thoughts and voiced his own concerns regarding the I.V. CSD’s ability to tackle the project as a newly formed entity and suggested approaching UCSB’s Associated Students for greater collaboration with the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am still a little bit concerned about the potential for this being a much bigger event during an already unsanctioned event,” Bertrand said. “I am definitely in support of scaling this down in any way that we can and aspiring to, in the next few years, put on this full event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the next I.V. CSD meeting will have a more in-depth revision of the budget, as well as possible updates from negotiations with other organizations. With the festival plans requiring months of preparation, Abboud says the board will have to make a decision soon over whether or not to actually hold the festival, possibly by the last I.V. CSD meeting of October or the first meeting of November.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

But these national events weren’t just headlines to the students of UCSB; at the time, male college-aged students were being drafted in droves for the Vietnam War, the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill saw an outage that would later lead to the modern environmental movement and four college students had been killed by National Guard soldiers during an anti-war protest at Kent State in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista quickly became a countercultural hub, in part because of the high student population and small-town nature that made the area a breeding ground for political activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just felt like the country was on the verge of a revolution. It was easier to feel that way when we’re all in a center of a refuge of like-minded people like here in Isla Vista,” Steve Byrd, who attended UCSB between 1965 and 1970, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anti-war movement at UCSB and Isla Vista differentiated from movements at other universities during the period, Byrd said, in part because of the violent tensions that led to the burning of the local Bank of America building, the death of a student by the hands of police and the deployment of the national guard by then-governor Ronald Reagan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd, a senior at the time, had a front row seat for it all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He described the hippie movement in the area as “peaceful” — at least until January 1970. The rest of the 1969-1970 academic year was marked by three distinctive phases of rioting, culminating in June with the arrival of the National Guard and the arrest of 10% of Isla Vista’s population one week before final exams, Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event that sparked the violence of 1970 is arguably the most nationally well-known event in the university’s history: the burning of the Bank of America building in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The government was continuing the same old way … they just wouldn’t change. They just kept on doing the same thing, kept on being involved in the same imperialistic overseas wars, no matter how much people protest it. At the time, the Bank of America … it came out they had extensive investments in the Vietnam War and profiteering off the Vietnam War.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90136\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/katherine-swartz_portrait_online_1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90136\" data-attachment-id=\"90136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/katherine-swartz_portrait_online_1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1463&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1463\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Katherine Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90136\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd stands in front of Embarcadero Hall, the former location of the Bank of America building that burned down in 1970. </span><em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A crowd of “a few hundred” gathered around the Bank of America building in Isla Vista, the current site of Embarcadero Hall. They broke windows, grabbed furniture out of the building and made a large pile, lighting it on fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately, police from surrounding towns were brought in the area, and Byrd remembers their “aggressive” behavior toward all of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They didn’t know Isla Vista at all, they just knew the stereotypes and they were pissed off. They were pissed off to be here and maybe fearful and scared and they became very aggressive with us, very, very aggressive with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three days, students “ran [the police] out of town,” according to Byrd. But the violence of 1970 was far from over. Just a couple months later, in mid-April, police killed UCSB student Kevin Moran who went to help put out fires started by rioters. Moran shouted, “Don’t shoot at us — we’re putting the fire out!” according to El Gaucho, a former version of the Daily Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Byrd, police initially tried to blame Moran’s death on student snipers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They told all the students snipers had done it for the first several days and things like that.

This stemmed from a deeper distrust he observed between the older and younger generations during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used to get stopped by the police all the time, you know, just for being young, just for being counter-cultural looking a little bit. I really noticed the difference now that I get older, because I’m just not stopped for no reason like I was when I was young.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During an especially tumultuous period at the end of June, right before finals, over 1,000 people were arrested in Isla Vista for violating a temporary curfew, including Byrd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd recounted his own experience of being arrested for being out past curfew, describing the “aggressive” nature of policing at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The police would go and start ‘bam, bam, bam’ on your apartment door. They’d knocked down the door and to smithereens. And they’d bust in and people would be hiding underneath their beds and in the shower in the bathroom. They’d come and then they say you’re violating curfew after they yanked them outside of their own house and then take them away to jail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd said he was held overnight with “40 people in a cell for four people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were just crammed in like sardines into a cell where you couldn’t even lay down or even hardly sit down,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were violating the Constitution. They were inflicting punishment before trial, before being found guilty, just inflicting their own revenge kind of punishment on arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perceptions of Byrd and students at the time weren’t reflected in the national media coverage over the course of the 1969-1970 year; a New York Times column published in August 1970 described Isla Vista as a “ghetto,” blaming students for the violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The mere words ‘University of California’ on the ballot, in the current public mood, would probably doom a modest subsidy to cure cancer,” columnist Winthrop Griffith wrote at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd believes the media focused solely on the violence, ignoring the peaceful protesting of students and deep political values against the war that motivated their actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a stereotype that sold newspapers. It’s so media, you know, it’s the way the news media always is. They write up the sensationalistic thing to get readership up. And by stirring the pot, by making the young people into the troublemakers and everything, it’s just a stereotype that most older people had,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw the value of the counter cultural revolution, that peace and love and anti-militarism or values, that were worth pursuing, not just because we were young, but they were lifelong values that were worth pursuing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five year-period of history of UCSB’s, and the nation’s country, may as well be a snapshot in history — a time when the country was at war and the culture was rapidly changing. Isla’s Vista’s student-dominant environment stood out against the landscape of Goleta and Santa Barbara, where adults looked down on the “hippie” look and lifestyle of UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All the young people clustered here and they feel like this was their safe space, in Isla Vista,” Byrd said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first came to Isla Vista in 1965, it was a very different place, almost a 1950s preppy place. Then it changed just in a couple of years to this big hippie revolution and all the countercultural revolution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD normally uses the Community Room to hold its meetings every other Tuesday, but the board meeting relocated to St. George Youth Center due to the air conditioning leaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the two leaks — one in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and the other in the walls from water pipes — were first discovered on Sept. 13. Abboud was then told by Santa Barbara County’s general services that it would be two weeks before the leaks were fixed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, on Sept. 20, Abboud said he was told that the room would be closed indefinitely until a team can come in and inspect it due to mold being discovered in the walls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re fixing the HVAC leak soon, but the leak in the wall with the piping needs to wait for the hazmat to come in. There was mold in the walls because of the leaks,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New cabinets, flooring, drywall and paint are required to repair the damage and Grey hopes to have the room reopened by the last week of October.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bad situation, but I know we’re going to be working hard so the county is getting this done,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V.

id=\"caption-attachment-80692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The foot patrol is set to launch the program around the weekend of Sept. 20. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, named the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program, is set to launch around the weekend of Sept. 20, in time for UC Santa Barbara’s move-in weekend, Foot Patrol Lieutenant Juan Camarena announced during an I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Aug. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Restorative justice is an approach to justice that… identifies the harm that is done, how can that harm be repaired and who is responsible,” Camarena said, adding that the purpose of such a program is to “strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Isla Vista resident who violates specific Santa Barbara County ordinances – ordinance 36-2: consuming alcohol in public; 36-3: having an open container or 40-2: playing loud music outside of curfew hours – will now have the option of attending a two-hour educational workshop and completing four hours of community service instead of paying a fine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating these ordinances can cost a maximum of $100 for first violation, $200 for the second violation and $500 for each additional violation that occurs within that same year, Camarena explained. </span></p>\n<p>Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder added that there are additional court processing and court security fees that can add anywhere from $40 to $100 to the initial fine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the workshops, individuals will be educated about the section they violated, how that violation affected the community around them and why the ordinance was created in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshops will be operated by the sheriff’s office, the I.V. CSD, UCSB student organizations and long-term I.V. residents, Camarena said. The program also hopes to also partner with Santa Barbara City College to hold the workshops, as many students who attend the city college also choose to live in I.V., he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if residents choose the workshop and community service route, the violation won’t appear on their permanent record, Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We want] education of the actual violation,” Camarena said, citing the loud music ordinance that prohibits amplified music past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. “[The program] would go into more details of [what it means] to disturb someone’s peace.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated there would be an attempt on law enforcement’s part to reach out to the offenders and to ask feedback questions during the workshops, such as “How can we solve this problem that we have here? What things can we share with the community to prevent these types of violations?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the community service branch of the program, offenders will primarily work with the I.V. Recreation and Park District and the I.V. CSD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The program] will educate the offenders of the consequences of their actions… I believe it will build trust and legitimacy in policing, it will give [law enforcement] an opportunity to reach out to the community and for the community to really understand law enforcement,” Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just us versus them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD endorsed the program at its Aug. 27 meeting, with Board President Spencer Brandt welcoming the attempt at offering alternative punishments for violations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education is always gonna go so much further than a slap-on-the-wrist approach,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [3:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to include further information from Schroeder and Camarena. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The old Ike’s building is newer – the infrastructure and everything is better. Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V. I go walk around at different times of day and observe the busiest parts. Trigo is dead on the weekends, and the busiest street is Pardall and the area where Woodstock’s is. Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/amidst-lawsuit-ikes-moves-to-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues between the sandwich shop and the property manager, Icon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the reported presence of mold at the location, led owner Ike Shehadeh to pack up shop and move to State Street. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/","id":4149,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[4148,4147,4146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | Newest I.V.

For any house that is willing to host his stand, Muñoz offers 50 free tacos in exchange for use of the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He estimates that he serves around 100 customers each day his stand is open, totaling an approximate 600 tacos in addition to the numerous quesadillas and mulitas. He works the stand along with his nephew and his friend, preferring to maintain a small team in order to ensure quality of the food he serves and to build close relationships with his customers, he told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think food in Isla Vista is expensive. When the food and rent costs so much, the students are unhappy. I believe we are helping students by offering our tacos,” Muñoz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He initially learned how to cook while employed at a food truck in Long Beach called Los Tres Garcias, working as a chef there for two years before moving to a restaurant in Gardena, California, called El Antojito Tacos y Mariscos, where he stayed for another six years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After moving to the Santa Barbara area, Muñoz briefly worked at the Subway in UC Santa Barbara’s Arbor. Muñoz explained that his dream is to eventually relocate his taco stand to the Arbor – as a small indoor eatery or a permanent food stall, much like Die Bretzel or Woodstock’s – in order to better serve the students and connect with more customers. </span></p>\n<p>Photos taken at one of <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muñoz’s set ups on Del Playa Drive can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-89596-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1336\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89588\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1327\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89585\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89583\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1212\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89592\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_11\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89593\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_12\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1315\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89582\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_13.jpg?fit=2000%2C1267\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89594\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_13\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1462\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89589\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?fit=2000%2C1170\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89595\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_14\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As a student, Macias said she believes that art is commodified and generally something people cannot enjoy unless they have excess funds to pay for expensive art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just look at romance painters,” Macias said. “They were always court painters. They did portraits for royalty. They did marble statues, they painted churches, so [art] has always been a commission-based thing and it has always been commissioned by higher classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led Macias to research ways to share her art with the “broke college kids” around her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to make her art more accessible, Macias puts her art on stickers, with sizes to fit Hydroflasks and lighters, and she creates poetry and art for Um…Magazine, an online student-run publication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias has fallen in love with the I.V. art community and is an artist who believes even college students should be able to appreciate art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that is what I really like about I.V. art movements. It is so inclusive,” said Macias. She found UCSB to be elitist when it comes to art projects, only allowing incredibly skilled artists to produce art around campus, yet I.V. is welcoming to all skill levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in her free time, Macias has taken up denim painting commissions – an unconventional art form not often seen in I.V. She charges between $20 and $35 for the art, depending on whether the buyer provides their own denim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like painting denim, not only because it is an easy way to get my art affordably out there, but also I feel like it makes my art mobile,” Macias explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend moving to Germany in July could not take acrylic paints with her onto the plane, so she gifted them to Macias a couple months before she left. Without a canvas and disliking the look of acrylics on paper, Macias painted on denim for the first time in the spring, adding flowers to her mother’s jacket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The denim jacket] was the coolest thing and it didn’t have any marks on it or anything. I had it all throughout high school,” Macias said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that painting on denim is surprisingly difficult in contrast to her familiar watercolors, which she considers to be the most forgiving medium due to water always being able to change the image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with denim’s rough surface, the paint needs to be combined with a mixing medium and sealed with heat to make it last through a wash, and many layers of paint are needed to produce a bright color. Macias also found that her line work needs to be more precise with acrylics than with watercolors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias noticed that people were afraid to alter their own clothing but still wanted to have personalized art, which Macias said is why she chooses to create commission-based denim rather than selling original denim creations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t feel like they have the time or the energy or skill to create something but that doesn’t mean they can’t. They just need other ways to get there and that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t reap the benefits of their own creative mind.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every girl has a pair of high-waisted jeans in their drawer,” Macias said. “Some of them are booty shorts, some of them are cut-off, but they all have some pair of high waisted denim shorts somewhere and it’s just like, ‘Why don’t you paint the back pocket?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She often encourages people to paint with her if they want to try it out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you could do that or you want to do that, then sit here and try it with me at least, and if we mess up, Livi can try to fix your shorts,” said Macias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with Vincent van Gogh’s famous paintings “Starry Night” and “Café Terrace at Night,” Macias finds emotion to be an important part of art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His most beautiful works were actually made when he was in recovery,” Macias explained. She added that she is troubled by society’s romanticization of mental illness and creation and finds many believe Van Gogh and other celebrated creators would not have been as gifted or talented without their mental illnesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He portrays entire emotions of happiness and hope in those just by the use of color,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her inspiration comes from whatever she is feeling at the moment with the paper she has on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias’ previous art pieces range across many emotions, from darker works about drug use and overdose to cuter, summer works with bright yellows and golds. She keeps various notebooks with each featuring a different theme, often with as many as twenty notebooks partially filled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Art is expression…and that’s what I really want to portray in what I do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Daniel Bertucelli</i></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As July came to a close, the property, which had its fence torn down and water and gas lines damaged, still had red and yellow tape around it, warning that the property is uninhabitable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are 12 residents in the house, the two receiving money, UC Santa Barbara student Anthony A. and recent UCSB graduate Jonah I., were the only residents living in the house at the time of the incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair are being funded $300 each for “food, housing, moving, and storage expenses,” according to a statement sent to the Associated Students Senate by Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) Chair Alex Young. Young is a third-year political science and global studies double major at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will come from two places: for Anthony A., as a UCSB student, the $300 will come from the IVTU Crisis Fund, a fund created specifically for crisis events such as the July 12 one on Del Playa, according to Young.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Jonah I. is not a UCSB student, but a recent graduate, the $300 will come from the IVTU Community Fund, an account created at the end of the 2018-19 school year to help provide nonstudents with funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate voted in late July to pass the IVTU’s minutes, giving it permission to disperse the money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Relocation costs can be burdensome, and can make studying, working, or living very difficult without assistance,” IVTU Chair Alex Young said in a message to the senators, asking that they approve the funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our mission is unique in that we are charged with helping all people who live in IV, not just UCSB students, as shown by our support of both a student and a non-student in this incident. We see it as our duty to help people of IV with the heavy costs of displacement in the event of a crisis or incident,” Young said in a separate statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspected driver of the car, 18-year-old Danyale Guy Jr., has since been released from police custody after turning himself into the Santa Barbara County Public Defender’s Office the day after the incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guy is not a UC Santa Barbara student; Santa Barbara City College spokesperson Luz Reyes-Martin did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding whether Guy was enrolled at the community college.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
