Event organizers provided students with the overview, background, pros, cons and endorsements of Proposition 1 through Proposition 12, excluding Proposition 9.</p>\n<p>Proposition 9 was<a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/prop-9-supreme-court-ruling.pdf\"> removed from the ballot</a> in July by the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Rain Kahsu, organizer of the Biko Voting Infonight and fourth-year political science student, said she wanted to hold this event after speaking to her housemates about the election and realizing that “we were all freaking out.”</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to have an event where I could be with members of the community and my friends and just talk about this kind of stuff that’s kind of scary. There’s so much information,” Kahsu said.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20 people attended and discussed each proposition, asking questions about the issues, providing clarifications and offering personal opinions.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the propositions discussed was Proposition 8, which would limit the amount of money kidney dialysis clinics could charge for treatment.</p>\n<p>As with the other propositions, organizers went over the pros and cons, stating that clinics would be prevented from treating patients differently based on what type of insurance they have, so the proposition could result in the closure of “many” California dialysis clinics.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had their phones out throughout the event, googling specific proposition language and facts to aid the conversation.</p>\n<p>At one point, an attendee frustrated with the complex and vague language of the propositions exclaimed, “Why is it so difficult to fucking vote?”</p>\n<p>While the remark was met with laughs, the sentiment was echoed by several students at the event.</p>\n<p>Kahsu hoped students attending the event would come and “gain information they didn’t know and be able to ask questions” and “be able to talk about how they’re going to vote or things they’ve heard.”</p>\n<p>For fourth-year global studies major Naima Sudjian-Carlisle, Monday’s event was an opportunity to be involved with a community event where students could learn from each other.</p>\n<p>“I procrastinated in researching what’s on the ballot, what people to vote for and everything like that,” Sudjian-Carlisle said. “I was really glad to hear different perspectives on propositions. I’m now informed for voting tomorrow, but I still want to do some research tonight.”</p>\n<p>Other attendees agreed that it was helpful to get together with community members to talk about the ballot before voting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The proposition language can be really confusing, so it’s helpful to just be in a group with other people and go through them to kind of pick them apart to see what is actually the intention of each proposition,” said Solmaz Soleimani, a UCSB Class of 2018 graduate.</p>\n<p>Kat Ghodoosian, a third-year political science student, emphasized the importance of being an informed voter. She said the event helped her “get more of a nuanced perspective.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s one thing to go out and register and vote, but it’s another thing to be an informed voter,” Ghodoosian said. “UCSB students should feel responsible not only to be registered and to go out to the polls, but they should also be responsible for knowing what’s on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>Attendees left the event around 6:30 p.m., with several promising to post their further research on the propositions on the Biko Garage Facebook page before the election the next day.</p>\n<p>Kahsu was optimistic about how the info night had gone, stating she hoped attendees were able to walk away “a little more informed and a little less anxious.”</p>\n<p>“Vote and, even more than that, try to be more engaged in politics and with your community,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Located at 6583 Pardall Rd., Rockfire Grill is the latest addition to the collection of I.V. eateries.</p>\n<p>The restaurant currently has four locations in Southern California: Long Beach, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach and now, I.V.</p>\n<p>“[Rockfire Grill is] a fun and safe place for kids to unwind, try some different food that they normally don’t get in the I.V. area and just be in a space to be engaged with the community,” Jai Syal, Rockfire director of marketing and strategy, said.</p>\n<p>“Our burgers come on a fresh-baked flatbread bun, and that bun

but it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/\">discussed plans</a> to open the park in February, according to Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD).</p>\n<p>Construction for the park was expected to begin during spring. However, the construction was delayed until August, Lebell said.</p>\n<p>About 30 members of the I.V. community were in attendance at the grand opening, alongside four IVRPD Board members, including Pegeen Soutar and Matias Eusterbrock. Both worked alongside Lebell during the construction process.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD made several changes to the park in order to made it dog-compatible, including securing the perimeter with fences and altering the landscape to make it a safer space, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“[The IVRPD] secur[ed] the fence in the back and [ran] a fence in the front with a double gate, as well as a vehicle access gate, and then we took out all of the rubber multrain on the place structure and replaced it with wood chips,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>The board hopes to add several more features to the park, including sprinklers, tables, an additional mutt mitt dispenser, a tunnel bridge, ramps and slides, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the biggest setback the IVRPD faced in establishing the park was “finding the right park that would work… having enough space and [finding] a neighborhood it wouldn’t be a problem in.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD initially planned to create the dog park in Anisq’Oyo Park. However, it was found unsuitable due to incompatible aspects of the terrain, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>With the growing population of dogs in I.V., concerns with the safety of residents has risen, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD is providing a dog training course that is free and accessible to all residents in I.V. The board is working with Jeike Meijer, Associated Students external vice president of local affairs, to help fund this program.</p>\n<p>The dog training courses will be every Sunday at 11 a.m. at Sueno Park, beginning on Oct. 21. A trainer from “Four on the Floor,” a locally based training company, will teach the dogs a basic set of behaviors.</p>\n<p>The training course’s’ main objective is to “help students afford an opportunity to train their dogs and also have a better relationship with their dog,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the training courses, the board would like to work with Progressive Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.), a national charitable organization, to offer a mobile health van that provides dogs with medical resources such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the board hopes to “build a community around dogs in I.V.” that helps foster a welcoming environment, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/","id":4254,"author":{"id":241,"name":"Medlyn Grasheyella"},"related":[4253,4252,4251],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pardall Carnival Brings Together I.V.

IVCRC’s external chair, Katrina Nicado, and Internal Chair Nicole Tan both agree that not much has changed over the years.</p>\n<p>“The Pardall Carnival continues to bring out new students to get to better know the community and gives groups and organizations a better opportunity to recruit students,” Nicado said.</p>\n<p>Close to 60 student organizations and small businesses joined the fun at the carnival this year, providing attendees with opportunities to better know them and their respective missions, alongside fun games and free goodies.</p>\n<p>Popular attractions included caricature drawings, the Hijinio “El Elotero” Camacho and the Ferris wheel emblematic of the carnival.</p>\n<p>Businesses such as Isla Vista Outfitters, HOPR and PokeCeviche all appeared on Pardall Road alongside student organizations including Life of the Party, Students Against Sexual Assault and the Queer Commision.</p>\n<p>All of the aforementioned organizations gathered to promote themselves as well as help new students feel welcomed to the community.</p>\n<p>Tan attributed Pardall Carnival’s success to the team effort that goes on behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>“We have different committees that handle different tasks, like communicating with the businesses or handling the free shirts,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ruth Garcia Guevara, Associated Students community volunteer coordinator and IVCRC advisor, organizes the carnival every year.</p>\n<p>“What started with a small group of students having an idea, has turned into one of the most anticipated events of the school year, not only for students but the entire IV community,” Guevara said in a Facebook post.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It had been located at 971 Embarcadero Del Mar for 14 years and at 6578 Trigo Road for eight years before that, according to Alfonso Espino, Hempwise owner.</p>\n<p>“We were really all about kind of being a hub for the community and… being there for people who are interested in these types of things, especially alternative resources,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise closed its location in I.V. because their lease was not renewed by the owners of the lot. Espino hopes to move the shop to a new location in I.V. or Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[We have] been kind of scrambling for a new location and haven’t been able to find anything in I.V., but hopefully we’ll find something soon,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise had their last business day this past Monday and will be completely out of the building by the end of this month. Espino is still unsure when or where he will be able to open a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>SORRISO ITALIANO</strong></p>\n<p>The authentic Italian stop at 901 Embarcadero Del Mar closed in early June of this year, ending five years of business in I.V. with a wine tasting party.</p>\n<p>The owners, Antonio and Elisabetta Gerli, worked together in the restaurant, dividing the work between themselves. The long shifts and time taken away from family was a significant reason for closing, according to Antonio.</p>\n<p>“There are different reasons, but I think the most important was that my wife was the chef and I was in the front so we worked like 14 hours a day and we have a family,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>Sorriso also catered frequently for events for the UCSB Athletic Department.</p>\n<p>The couple recently accepted positions at Due Lune Cucina, an Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara. Antonio now works there as a manager and Elisabetta as executive chef. While they are enjoying the benefits of a lighter schedule, Antonio still reminisces on their time in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I miss Isla Vista because that was a great environment and good vibe, but you know, sometimes… you need to change your chapter of your life and we did it,” Gerli said.</p>\n<p><strong>KAPTAIN’S FIREHOUSE BBQ</strong></p>\n<p>Once wedged between Study Hall and Varsity Bike Shop at 6543 Pardall Road, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ shut down its location during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break in 2017.</p>\n<p>When it opened back in 2013, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ was a division of a larger company which also caters to festivals and large venues among other events.</p>\n<p>Despite its popularity in the early years as well as in other divisions of the company, the loss of popularity at the location in I.V. was a factor in its closure, according to Michael “The Kaptain” Gould, owner of the company.</p>\n<p>“For the first three years, we rocked it. We did really really really well. It was the last two years where it just became kind of stagnant,” The Kaptain said. “We made a couple changes to the menu, but it was kind of that I.V. rotation of restaurants that come through and it seemed like we had our run.”</p>\n<p>After expansions and growing success in the other divisions of his company, The Kaptain decided to close down the location in I.V. to concentrate on his other projects.</p>\n<p>“The easier thing to do would be to close I.V. and focus on, you know, where all our money was at.”</p>\n<p>The Kaptain recently opened a new division of his company which serves cold brew coffee and micro-brews at events, along with ribs, grilled wings and corn that was emblematic of the shack.</p>\n<p><em>Hiwi Tropical Fusion and Juice It Up, The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop and Rincon Brewery could not be reached for comment.</em></p>\n<p>While these businesses are closing their doors, new ones such as Hanamura on Embarcadero Del Mar, One Piece on Pardall Street and California Tacos and Taproom on Embarcadero del Norte have eagerly moved into their places.</p>\n<p><strong>CALIFORNIA TACOS AND TAPROOM</strong></p>\n<p>The fourth location of the Mexican fusion taco joint California Tacos and Taproom moved in the lot formerly occupied by The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop in August. Alex Uribe, the owner of the company, said he will be adding elements specifically designed for the demographic in Isla Vista, including televisions, 12 to 16 brews on tap and enhanced outdoor seating areas.</p>\n<p>“I think what was lacking before was a little bit of personality,” Uribe said. “I think that the students are looking for a good place to hang out, to have good food, a good atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Uribe is confident that the atmosphere of the restaurant and items of the menu will draw popularity to a notoriously unsuccessful property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Uribe, a UCSB alum, will also have his son, a current UCSB student, managing the restaurant and providing a student perspective on the business.</p>\n<p>“I used to go to UCSB a long time ago so I’m a little familiar with the area and although everything you know changes and evolves, I think I have a little bit better understanding than a regular person would come in and didn’t come to the school.”</p>\n<p>Uribe estimates California Tacos and Taproom will officially open around October 15 of this year.</p>\n<p><em>Hanamura and One Piece could not be reached for comment.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Within seconds, Yokota quickly received likes, comments and messages in response to her post.</p>\n<p>“For some reason it just blew up like crazy, so quickly, too. The second I posted it, my phone was blowing up with messages and notifications.”</p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>Nexus</em>’ interview with Yokota, there were a total of 73 members in the GroupMe for Coast Carvers and approximately 100 people who had contacted Yokota about her post, from newcomers to I.V. to experienced skaters to parents asking Yokota to teach their own kids how to skate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83848\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83848\" data-attachment-id=\"83848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/coast-carvers-hit-the-streets-of-isla-vista/unnamed-2-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1358%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1358,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83848\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C1339\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1358&amp;ssl=1 1358w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Masaki Osato</em></p></div>\n<p>Yokota founded the group after taking interest in a similar female skating group based out of Venice Beach called GRLSWRL, which is “a modern-retro all-female stoke-chasing community focused on bringing femininity… to the male dominated skate scene,” according to the group’s website.</p>\n<p>Yokota was never able to attend one of GRLSWRL’s bi-weekly scheduled skate sessions, but from meeting up for casual skate sessions with some of the members, she felt that I.V. would provide the ideal space for a group with similar purposes.<br>\n“It’s something that Isla Vista kind of needed, but nobody knew it needed that,” Yokota said.</p>\n<p>Although they have similar missions, the two groups hold some key differences, such as Coast Carvers’ inclusion of “anything that shreds in I.V.,” namely roller-skating and surfing in addition to skating. Yokota says this inclusion is ideal for their group given the diversity of sports and hobbies practiced by girls in I.V.</p>\n<p>Yokota also notes variations in the general energy and mood of the two skate groups, which she attributes to the differences of the locations that each group call home.</p>\n<p>“[In Venice] there’s just a bunch of random people and strangers and it’s really crowded, it’s kind of stressful,” Yokota said. “But then when I skated on DP, it was a Sunday evening and I just had my nine girls with me, and it was just really peaceful honestly.”</p>\n<p>Being a girl in the world of skating can prove to be intimidating for many people, she said. The seemingly overwhelming proportion of men to women who skate can make it difficult for women feel confident attending skateparks and the like, but skating in groups like Coast Carvers can afford them a sense of support and companionship, according to Yokota.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to full-send something when you’re just scared… so having girls around you just kind of builds your confidence,” Yokota said. “I don’t want girls to feel like they can’t do things just because they are girls or because there aren’t enough girls doing something.”</p>\n<p>Yokota is hopeful that Coast Carvers will continue to grow once the academic year begins. At that time, she plans to have scheduled skate sessions during the week and wants to eventually create an executive board to help run the club.</p>\n<p>Depending on the success of the group in the next year, Yokota has also been toying with the idea of expanding Coast Carvers into a multi-chapter organization in order to create a network of girl skaters both locally and regionally.</p>\n<p>“That’s what called out to me, is that I could be a part of something bigger.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
