As early as winter break, students are advised to start thinking about housing and discussing budget with their parents/guardians as appropriate, to determine what would be the best fit for them. Students looking for housing should plan to attend one of the “Housing 101” programs that are offered by University &amp; Community Housing Services (UCHS) in various residence halls during winter quarter. These programs thoroughly cover university-owned and privately-owned community housing options, including deadlines, processes, types of leases, choosing a space and choosing roommates. </span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Begin figuring out who you would like to live with in October. The earlier you start looking the better. Most people find what they are looking for during December, but options remain later on. Smaller places such as one-bedroom apartments get taken up first while larger houses are on the market longer. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are my housing options (university vs. I.V.)? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For university-owned housing, current first-year students are guaranteed a space in the residence halls; current third-year and fourth-year students also have the option of university-owned apartments, which are guaranteed if they lived in the residence halls for their first two years and they meet the deadlines. For privately-owned options in the community, including Isla Vista, students can access the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for available housing and should plan to attend one of the UCHS Rental Fairs on campus that bring property management companies together with prospective residents.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university offers living arrangements both on and off campus. There are university apartments specifically for upperclassmen and graduate students. Isla Vista also offers many housing options. Both houses and apartments are up for rent. Several co-op houses exist in I.V. as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>How late is too late to look for housing? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s never too late! However, the longer you put it off, the fewer options you will have. There are always options, but you may not find exactly what you are looking for. Looking by December/January just gives the widest range of options.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Is there a best area in I.V. to rent (a.k.a., where to get most of your money)? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on what you are looking for. Typically, the closer a house is to the ocean (Del Playa, Sabado Tarde) the more expensive it will be. Houses closest to campus may also be a bit pricier. However, pricing varies from house to house and depending on the management company. More expensive houses may also offer more amenities and features.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When do leases in I.V. typically start and end?</b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most leases are from June to June with leases starting at the end of the month and ending shortly after spring finals. Other leases may start in July or even in September before the start of the regular school year. Most leases take place over a 12-month period. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have anyone in mind to live with? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In university-owned housing, students self-assign themselves into an available vacant space; the other spaces in the room/apartment are filled in by other continuing students through the same self-assignment process or by new incoming students during the summer. For privately-owned community options, students can utilize the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to list themselves as a ‘Roommate Available’ and can also browse through listings of other students who are looking to fill a space in their unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing and many property management companies offer individual contracts for units, meaning you can find housing on your own and you won’t be responsible if one of your roommates leaves the unit. But if you still want to find friends to live with, be sure that you work as roommates. The people you party with may not be ideal to live with. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor’s Note</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Additionally, if you’re interested in living in Isla Vista but don’t have people in mind to live with, or are going abroad and will only be in I.V. for one or two quarters, many students post in the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/364409110289576/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Housing Facebook group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to look for additional people to add onto their lease or for subleasers during the summer or the school year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t want to live in I.V.? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also options in Goleta and Santa Barbara on the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing is the most common alternative though some students choose to live in Goleta. Keep in mind the longer commute and greater distance from the student community. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are the university-owned apartments like? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pictures, maps, floorspace plans and virtual tours of the </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university-owned apartments are available online here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When can I apply for UCSB housing as a second, third or fourth year? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing students can find </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/contracts/continuing-students-undergraduate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application deadlines for university-owned housing here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What should I do before I sign my lease? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students should visit the UCHS office upstairs in the University Center if they would like to have their privately-owned apartment lease reviewed. It is recommended that roommate groups go over the lease together to come up with questions before visiting the UCHS office for review.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask to see the unit in person. Make sure the unit has everything you’re looking for. Spend some time talking to the property managers and develop a relationship. Discuss any parts of the lease needing clarification. Be sure that all your prospective housemates are on board and understand the terms of the lease. Some also find it useful to ask current or previous tenants their experiences living in the unit. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have a parent to co-sign with me? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students without a co-signer may have different options depending on the management company and who their prospective roommates are. A student without a co-signer can have a roommate’s parent/guardian co-sign for them if they are willing to do so. If that is not an option, the student without a co-signer can talk to the management company to see if they would be willing to increase the security deposit in lieu of the co-signer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some landlords require students to have a parent co-sign. But usually as long as you can prove your income and ability to pay rent, a parent co-sign is not needed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>What are my rights as a tenant? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS has a </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/student-success-guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Success Guide online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that goes over tenants’ rights and responsibilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I have a dispute with my landlord over my security deposit? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students with security deposit disputes can be assisted by UCHS. To avoid disputes, it is HIGHLY recommended that tenants have a move-in and move-out video in order to protect their deposit. For a small fee, UCHS will video the condition of the unit before move-in to document any pre-existing damages and then again at move-out to detail the condition of the unit at the end.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) offers counseling to anyone having a dispute with their landlord including over security deposits! IVTU’s office is on the second floor of Pardall Center. Come by between 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for free service to UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I want to terminate a lease early? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For privately-owned accommodations in the community, tenants generally need to find a replacement and pay a lease transfer fee in order to terminate their lease early. For university-owned housing, residents also need to find an eligible replacement, unless they cease to be a UCSB student, in which case their lease would likely be terminated.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminating a lease early can be tricky. The most important thing is to make your landlord aware of your situation. You may be required to find a replacement tenant or continue paying if you leave the home. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How does subleasing work? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you won’t be living at your home for more than a few weeks such as during the summer term or looking for somewhere to live without being a primary tenant, you may want to consider subletting. Many online communities specialize in connecting people looking to sublet to those looking for this type of living arrangement. Landlords have the right to not allow subletting. The landlord may first want to screen the person subletting before allowing the arrangement. From then it depends on your situation whether the person subletting pays rent directly to the landlord or to the main tenant. Be sure which amenities will be provided to the person subletting such as a mattress or other furniture.   </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/","id":4290,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[4289,4288,4287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proposed Deltopia Festival Postponed to 2021 Following Planning Delays","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-12-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lucidity presented its plan designed to steer people away from Del Playa Drive and increase safety precautions during Deltopia to the I.V.

CSD) reached out to Lucidity about a festival designed to steer people away from Del Playa Drive and increase safety precautions during Deltopia, Lucidity presented its plan to the I.V. CSD board in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\">early October</a>. Since then, the I.V. CSD has been engaged in negotiations with various community stakeholders — law enforcement, UC Santa Barbara, County Public Works and Lucidity — to determine the feasibility and necessity of the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late October, Lucidity cut the budget for the proposal </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by $20,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, following district concerns that the price tag for the festival would be too much for the district to shoulder alone.

CSD delayed its decision on the proposal to December after noting a number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/i-v-csd-vote-for-lucidity-festival-on-deltopia-postponed-to-december/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“outstanding issues”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the contract, particularly with the police presence needed at the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t think that on the current timeline we’ll be able to accomplish our goals and so it’s one of those things where we should not pull the trigger if we’re not 100% sped-up and ready,” Board President Spencer Brandt said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel that the best way to move forward is to set a target date for 2021 and to move forward with [the] group of stakeholders,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, stressed the timeliness of the plan’s approval when it was first proposed in October, so that preparations could be made in time for the spring. She had hoped for a contract’s approval in a week’s time, but negotiations with various parties stretched to more than a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the delay, however, “Lucidity is at the point where they’re willing to step back and withdraw their proposal for this year and try to work with us to try and find where best they can be plugged in,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that although plans for the spring festival were pushed back to 2021, the I.V.

CSD, said he is in contact with Katya Armistead, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of student life, to potentially open SunFest to I.V. residents who don’t attend UCSB, but the I.V. CSD still needs to meet with both UCSB and Lucidity to see where the two entities stand on the idea, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will still be in the picture and the I.V. CSD has “spoken with them about the possible use of the Guardians,” a security team focused on harm reduction, for a possible “alternative event in Isla Vista this year,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the original proposal to the I.V. CSD, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardianteam.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardians</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played a key role in emphasizing the need for safety precautions for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Craig Bonner, chief deputy for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, the office is “absolutely dedicated” to turning Deltopia into a safer event and is willing to help put safety measures in place for this upcoming Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything we can do to help mitigate the unsanctioned aspects of Deltopia is a good thing and obviously if we can get people into a controlled environment where they are safe, that is an excellent thing,” Bonner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The negotiations for the spring festival opened a much larger conversation on the safety issues seen at large events in I.V. and the I.V. CSD’s ability in tackling them, Brandt said at Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While these are fun events for many of our residents, there are many of our residents that are made to be victims by crime, by sexual assault during these large events and there is an abnormally high number of people who are hospitalized as a result of alcohol and drugs during these events,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw a spike in attendees, citations and arrests, but a decrease in medical transports; the majority of arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Deltopia is] one of the biggest public safety issues in our community and it’s also something that is absolutely revered by so many of the people who live here. It’s a tricky line to walk, but we have to be resolute in bringing these issues forward,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 14, 12:53 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Lucidity first proposed the plan to the I.V. CSD in early October. The I.V. CSD had reached out to Lucidity requesting a festival production consultation prior to October and Lucidity then created and brought the festival proposal to the I.V. CSD board in October. This article has been updated to reflect the correct information.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-77560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cajé is the first restaurant in Isla Vista to earn Ocean Friendly Restaurant status. <em>Michelle Sharp / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>To be designated as an Ocean Friendly Restaurant (OFR), a restaurant has to commit to a series of sustainable practices as set forth by the OFR program’s requirement sheet, including eliminating the use of polystyrene products and plastic bags, adhering to proper recycling practices and providing reusable foodware to patrons dining in the restaurant.</p>\n<p>Additionally, restaurants are required to serve vegan and vegetarian-friendly options and provide a discount to patrons who bring their own cups and containers.</p>\n<p>And as of earlier this month, Cajé is doing all of these things.</p>\n<p>According to manager Troy Yamasaki, the decision to make Cajé more sustainable was a long time in the making. He said he believes that businesses need to step up to provide their patrons with sustainable options, especially in a town as environmentally conscious as I.V.</p>\n<p>“There is something to be said about the people who did it when it was the right thing to do and not the optimal thing to do according to market demand,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>Daniela Schwartz, co-leader of the OFR program within the UCSB Surfrider branch, echoed Yamasaki’s words: “Young people are always looking to do environmentally friendly things that are good for our planet.”</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.surfrider.org/programs/ocean-friendly-restaurants\">Surfrider’s website</a>, the perks of being OFR-certified include national recognition on Surfrider social media, logos and other marketing materials, launch parties, collaborative promotions and, in some cases, tax-deductible contributions.</p>\n<p>Surfrider was founded in 1984 to protect ocean health, according to the website. The organization focuses on water quality, beach access and preservation and the protection of marine ecosystems.</p>\n<p>One of the ways it operates is through the OFR program, which, according to the website, was founded in 2010 to combat the disposal of single-use plastics by restaurants. The program “increases awareness, drives behavior change, and ultimately creates scalable impact to reduce our plastic footprint.”</p>\n<p>According to Schwartz, restaurants in I.V. are reluctant to commit to OFR status because there is an assumption that sustainable practices are expensive and exhaustive. This widely held belief is perhaps rooted in the fee associated with becoming an OFR, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz explained that the OFR fee is $62.50 per year, and that the cost of committing to sustainable products does not make a difference in the broader financial success of restaurants. Cajé made minimal changes in order to receive OFR status, with the most significant being the elimination of polystyrene products and plastic bags, Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>While Yamasaki agreed that attaining OFR status was not a financial burden for Cajé, he said that while the current demand for sustainable dining practices is still small, “the market will demand it eventually and we are already seeing small shifts. The awareness is there and appreciated, but as far as actively producing new sales, we are on the cusp.”</p>\n<p>Although Cajé is the first restaurant in I.V. to receive OFR status, there are other OFR certified restaurants in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, including Mesa Burger, Jane at the Marketplace, Old Town Coffee, the Boathouse at Hendry’s Beach and the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Schwartz hopes that making Cajé more sustainable will produce a domino effect in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to move beyond coffee shops to get a real restaurant [to become OFR certified],” she said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz and her team have presented the benefits of being OFR certified to the managers of Silvergreens and South Coast Deli in hopes that they will soon follow suit.</p>\n<p>While Schwartz thinks that it is unrealistic for all I.V. restaurants to become OFR certified, she believes that the OFR program is gaining traction this year.</p>\n<p>“Good habits that begin with OFR get carried on throughout life. The ball is rolling. We are hoping to get in touch with more restaurants as the year goes on, and to spread the word about being more sustainable in any way we can,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

Now, Dyeislife is a business that he runs with his partner Jack Hagerty, a former SBCC student, that manages die beer die tournaments across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness primarily manages tournaments at East Coast colleges such as Penn State and Clemson University while Hagerty handles the majority of the northern California events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just spreading the gospel of die across the country,” Hagerty said. “We just want to teach the kids what’s good. I mean, look at this energy, it’s so electric.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My goal is to have every backyard set up with a die table,” Guisness added. “Sand, astro, turf? Doesn’t matter, man, I just want kids playing this game. A lot of people think it’s bad because people are drinking, but hey, better beer than chugging a whole handle by yourself, you know what I mean? At least here with die, there are rules and you have to space it out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gusiness and Hagerty also mentioned that Kappa Sigma was instrumental in getting the event off its feet; the fraternity inspected the sand pits to be free of glass and set up the tables up for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reactions to the event were also very positive, with many non-SB natives complimenting Santa Barbara’s locale, vibe and weather, Hagerty said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite playing the game for years, Gusiness still finds himself reminiscing about Santa Barbara: its weather, picturesque environment and — not to mention — the joys of spreading beer die spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one does it quite like Santa Barbara,” Gusiness said. “I mean, look around. Beautiful blue skies, tons of dudes, tons of beer and tons of die sports. It’s a beautiful thing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/","id":4113,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[4112,4111,4110],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

CSD), because it is a public entity to provide officers for any large event, regardless of any separate private security hired for the event, according to Brandt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the district would like to minimize the police presence at the festival, he said, as simply seeing officers in uniform could be potentially unsettling for people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that cracking down and forcing and arresting and ticketing our way of public safety is not possible,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just drives a wedge between law enforcement and the community and we can’t go down that road again. We saw what happened in 2014, there was a riot and we can’t go back to that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman called the proposed contract with SBSO — which he said could potentially raise costs for the district </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “an endless pit of liabilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract includes an “indemnification” clause, which would require the I.V. CSD to agree to “indemnify, defend and hold harmless [the] COUNTY … against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, and/or liabilities,” according to the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman raised concerns that should a situation arise in which the SBSO would need to bring in more officers, costs would rise for the I.V. CSD. However, according to G. Ross Trindle, district counsel for the I.V. CSD, the possibility is very low for a situation in which the I.V. CSD would be at fault for the actions of SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow also mentioned concerns from SBSO leadership about the timeline of putting together the festival. At the I.V. Safe Task Force meeting held earlier that day, he said SBSO leadership did not believe that holding the festival this year “is the right path to take.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[SBSO’s] position on this is ‘wait until next year. It’s too soon and there’s plenty of time for us to get on the same page,’” Thurlow said at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract negotiations have been ongoing for over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a month</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now; the proposal was originally brought to the I.V. CSD in early October. Sara Marvel, director for Lucidity LLC, emphasized a month ago the importance of approving the contract in a week to get all the moving pieces ready in time for spring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of the board seemed to be seriously considering the possibility of pushing the festival until 2021, although Brandt was adamant that appropriate adjustments could be made to the contract in time for it to be passed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman stressed the timeliness of the contract as well, adding that pushing the festival to the following year would give the board more time to finalize contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A month ago we had a meeting and we were talking about these contracts and how we’re going to handle it. It was, essentially, if you don’t get the contract done right now, we won’t have enough time and that was a month [ago] and we still don’t have the contract done, it’s not going to happen until weeks from now,” Freeman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think we’re able to pull this off right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet, a resident of I.V. for eight years who attended Tuesday’s meeting, echoed Freeman’s thoughts, stating that she believed that changing the culture around Deltopia could not be done in a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So as far as the goals go, which is to change the atmosphere of Deltopia, it has to be a multi-year project. It’s not going to happen in one year. You have to think out a little bit farther because it will be a gradual process,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Fischer said this policy affects a few streets in Santa Barbara, some in Goleta and every street in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students like Joy, it was a shock to learn they would not be able to park their oversized vehicles in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be disappointing if they started enforcing [the ordinance] in I.V. to kick out students and others who literally can’t afford rent, and live in a van by necessity,” Joy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the College Affordability Town Hall on Oct. 11 students asked Supervisor Joan Hartmann how the ordinance would affect students who live in their vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [aren’t] students but tend to be other homeless adults,” she replied, explaining that the situation in 2013 – before the passing of the ordinance – saw a number of oversized vehicles parked in I.V. that were not owned by students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the issue of housing insecurity is not limited to non-student adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, the UC Global Food Initiative found that 5% of UC undergraduate and graduate students experienced housing insecurity at some point in their enrollment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. Some students choose to opt out of paying high rent prices by living in vehicles like vans, RVs or busses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katelyn Wiese, a third-year Santa Barbara City College geology student, moved into a school bus earlier this year. She had been living in I.V. for several months, but since these signs have gone up, she said she no longer feels comfortable parking her bus in the neighborhood and now parks in different locations around Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I can’t be in I.V. It’s not even an option for me,” she told the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard, the UC system has launched a Rapid Rehousing program to address housing insecure and houseless students; UCSB now receives $415,000 a year to assist housing-insecure and houseless students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Financial Crisis Response Team can place eligible students who are currently houseless or about to become houseless in bridge housing within 24 to 48 hours, after which the team will work with the student to help them find stable housing moving forward,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the program can also provide “awards” to students to help if “they have difficulty paying rent and need financial support to stay in their current housing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91253\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91253\" data-attachment-id=\"91253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0317\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91253\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=308%2C410\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Nadia Abushanab</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for some, the decision to move into a vehicle may not be motivated by finances. Both Wiese and Joy said that while their decisions to move into their vehicles were partially due to the financial benefit of not paying rent, they also said they wanted to experience more freedom, be able to travel more easily and learn to live more simply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara municipal code, all oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal. However, Alissa Hazard, a traffic engineer for the County of Santa Barbara, said that vehicles have previously only been cited when an I.V. resident files a complaint with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Wiese’s school bus is oversized, she has not yet been cited or towed as of mid-October. She has, however, had multiple negative interactions with I.V. residents, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[A resident] yelled at me a couple of times … he [said], ‘If you’re not out of here by sunset, I’m calling the cops on you!’ … He said that us van-dwellers make the neighborhood a shithole,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also had conflicts with the IVFP. “They would wake me up at 3, 4 a.m., banging on my door, shining lights in the windows, yelling at me to get out,” she recounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fischer emphasized that the ordinance only restricts oversized vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as Wiese’s school bus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not regular-sized vehicles. She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students. We want to be supportive and helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:01 a.m.]: Joy uses they/them pronouns.

id=\"caption-attachment-87302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deltopia (pictured in 2019) is typically a break-all-the-rules block party. Ludicity’s proposal would provide an alternative festival to Deltopia. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial proposal of a festival led many UC Santa Barbara students and community members to believe that Lucidity’s event would completely shut down Deltopia, as expressed at the town hall. However, members of Lucidity’s board of directors negated these rumors and expressed its hopes that the alternative festival would develop a more positive, fun-filled environment that would help channel the Deltopia crowds into a safer space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not invested in doing this if people don’t want it,” Lucidity Director Ron Glover said. “We were asked to come and we decided we’d give it a shot… we don’t have a magic wand, but we’ve been successful at what we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has faced pushback from both sides of the community around its involvement in the event. Some UCSB students have expressed concern over parting with their beloved Deltopia tradition, while other Isla Vista residents present at the town hall noted they would prefer to abolish the event entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was [an] overwhelming response that students don’t want to see it rebranded,” Lucidity Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Gabriel Haas said. “It comes from an idea that this is going to change or take away their beloved Deltopia party, and that’s not what we’re trying to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its proposed Deltopia festival budget by $20,000, leaving it with a $159,850 price tag in order to get the program underway, which places special emphasis on harm reduction and collaboration with the community. This includes the unique concept of “Guardians,” a specially trained group of people dedicated to de-escalating situations to reduce the need for law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Guardian team would serve as a buffer between students and law enforcement so that the vast majority of things, whether they be medical or conflicts, can be de-escalated, mediated and taken care of before escalating to law enforcement,” Haas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, many concerned community members placed an emphasis on their fear of outsiders coming into I.V. and wreaking havoc with no sense of personal responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haas noted that Lucidity’s goal is “to make the event awesome enough for crowds to come off Del Playa, but not so awesome that we attract huge out-of-town crowds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team hopes to accomplish this by enlisting local artists to play at two different stages in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and People’s Park, which will hopefully encourage students to enjoy the music without drawing in outsiders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity also explained its hopes for a more family-friendly event in the future. However, the team acknowledged that since this is the first iteration of the event, they wanted to prioritize the age range that the original Deltopia appealed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, UCSB’s A.S. Program Board commissioner, expressed her fears that Lucidity’s event would take away from the Program Board’s Warm Up event, which aims to act as a safe space that provides live music, drinks, snacks and other necessities to potentially inebriated students after Deltopia. She explained that after Deltopia and a Lucidity Festival, students might be too tired to attend the school-sanctioned nighttime event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also raised concern regarding the price tag, which the I.V. Community Services District explained would be covered by the district and other organizations who could potentially support the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that I think trying stuff is important and you won’t know… but it’s a $159,000 try,” Morrison said. “Can you justify spending that much on this event, rather than medical tents, drug testing, water or food that could help Deltopia in another way?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Lucidity returned to the point made at the beginning of the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this works, it works, and we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Glover said. “If it doesn’t, we won’t do it again… instead of not trying, and saying what if it doesn’t work, well, what if it does?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

But over the past 13 years, it has grown to become the Halloween hub of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the myriad of costume-esque clothing and accessory options, Sweet Jane sells birthday supplies, festival clothes and Isla Vista-specific merchandise — like “U Can Study Buzzed” shot glasses and Isla Vista flags, various bongs and pipes and sunglasses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve never raised the prices on our sunglasses,” owner Stella Termin added, waving toward the towering display by the cash register. “They’ve always been buy-one-get-one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Sweet Jane is known for its costume- and festival-ready inventory, students flock to the boutique at all times of the year, drawn in by the boutique’s unique Isla Vista college town vibes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I keep hearing it over and over again, ‘I love this store, I want everything in here,’ and it’s like yeah, this is the store where you want everything you don’t probably need,” Termin laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just because [the store is] unusual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been a small business owner in I.V. for so long, Termin has seen how the culture of the college town has changed as students roll through it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, Termin said she sold a lot of clothes and jewelry with peace signs. “The kids were into revolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never bought anything in camo or anything, and all of a sudden they started having camouflage parties,” she said. “I can see that there’s a difference — there’s a big difference.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Termin attributes the change in culture in I.V. to the rise of social media, pointing to the Facebook event for Floatopia in 2009 that drew over 12,000 people to I.V.’s beaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were actually on the sand; we were giving out water,” Termin said. “Let me tell you — I’ve never seen so many people on that beach.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took a half an hour just to get up and down the [beach] stairs; you couldn’t walk anywhere without stepping on a bottle or a can,” she added. “All the recycling people, the families, it was like their Black Friday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Had that not been posted on Facebook, we could have maybe still had, at least for a few more years, some real Floatopia,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of sad, ‘cause I see things change, you know, since when I first started.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in the past few years, Termin has seen many I.V. businesses come and go — she named Firehouse Subs, Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant and 212° Hotpot, which closed recently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that while some of the rent prices may seem doable at first sight, businesses have to consider the weeks or months during which students vacate Isla Vista, like over the summer or winter break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a continuum,” she said. “I’ve been lucky, knock on wood, because I was able to strategize and realize what I needed to do — I don’t know how — what I needed to do to be able to provide for what Isla Vista needed and wanted and to have fun.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90861\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90861\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90861\" data-attachment-id=\"90861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sweet jane 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90861\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alaska Yokota / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the high rents in Isla Vista, Termin added that there are a handful of licenses and taxes that she has to pay every year that make running a small business more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that they would give smaller businesses, especially those in seasonal, this type of environment, more tax breaks and more of tax initiatives, instead of pounding us over the head as businesses that make over half a million dollars a year,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Sweet Jane’s success, Termin said she thinks she has been around long enough to be able to maintain her level of business through word of mouth and the fact that most of her prices are cheaper than Amazon’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just think it’s being nice, treating your customers well, understanding what they need, put a smile on your face and be lucky,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweet Jane has rooted itself in the community, particularly through a handful of fun traditions. During the interview, Termin was ringing up students and noticed that one student was purchasing items for a birthday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Is it a birthday?” she asked. The student said yes, and Termin pulled out a box of buttons and stacks of cups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to pick a birthday mug and free birthday button,” Termin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really?” the student said. “These are so cute!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s fun,” Termin said afterward. “They get excited, because birthdays are big deals, whether they’re yours or somebody else’s.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the birthday cup tradition, Sweet Jane creates new sticker designs every month that the store gives out for free. Another student at the register fawned over the newest design, telling Termin that she had all of the most recent ones and that they were her favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Termin lived at the far end of Trigo Road for a few years in the ‘90s with a then-boyfriend, it wasn’t until a friend brought her here in 2006 that she really saw Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just nice, over the years, to see the road the store has been on and the different people that have passed through here. So many students have worked here, and it’s great,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Sweet Jane is well loved, and that makes me very, very proud and happy.

I could have punched him in the nose … or I could have started screaming, or at least yelled ‘get the fuck off of me.’ But I don’t know what it is … there’s this shame of, ‘I should’ve stood up for myself because I respected myself.’ And the moment I didn’t, so what does that say about what happened, you know what I mean?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get him to let her go, Doe said she told Smith that she needed to say goodbye to her friends “because they’re waiting for me” and told him she would “come right back.” She left and texted a group chat at 11:42 p.m. that night “CODE RED” and “where are you guys” in messages she showed the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She returned to her house with a group of friends, “and we were in my room, you know, crying, and I was a little in shock, like I had no idea what was going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another friend who discovered Doe in her room during this time spoke to the Nexus and independently verified Doe’s recounting of the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Doe’s friend went to get her water, she learned of a second woman returning to their house who had allegedly also been sexually assaulted by Smith after Doe left the Sigma Pi fraternity house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said it was this instance that pushed her to report the incident to Macke the next morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t gonna say anything, which looking back is crazy, you know what I mean? Because you should always say something,” Doe said. “Right when I found out it was beyond me, I was like, ‘I need to report this.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning, she called a close friend in Sigma Pi, who arranged a meeting between her and Macke. She said she met with Macke at noon, and at 3:41 p.m. that day, she received a text from her friend in Sigma Pi saying “he’s dropped,” referring to Smith.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Greek Life Responded: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the events of Oct. 3, Sigma Pi canceled its Midnight Madness party — one of the parties typically held every year by nearly all UCSB fraternities following the completion of rush week – Macke said in a message to the other Greek life presidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks later, on Oct. 17, the university sent out an alert about </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/two-incidents-involving-date-rape-drugs-reported-at-fraternity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two reported incidents involving date-rape drugs on Oct. 5 at an unnamed fraternity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The university’s alert sparked heavy backlash on social media both from students and local community members, with many taking issue with the fact that the university had not included the name of the fraternity involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe told the Nexus that the incidents of sexual assault that she reported to Macke were unrelated to the reported use of date-rape drugs mentioned in the alert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the university alert, the UCSB Interfraternity Council (IFC) announced in an email on Oct. 18 to all IFC members that they had decided to place a five-day suspension on “all fraternity social activities” between Oct. 18 and the morning of Oct. 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend all social activities was made “in light of an unprecedented level of misconduct from fraternity members and concerns from local law enforcement and University administration about systemic issues within the fraternity system,” according to the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the circulation of the fraternity member’s Facebook profile, rumors have spread around campus and Isla Vista regarding the location and alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. Sigma Pi’s name was mentioned by several social media accounts; one social justice-oriented Instagram account scheduled a protest walk against Sigma Pi before canceling it later that day to “give time for the victims to heal,” they wrote in a </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hT8YH80r/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said she agreed to speak with the Nexus because she needed to set the record straight. She emphasized that what happened to her “isn’t a Sigma Pi problem, and it’s not a Greek life problem.

rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020, prohibits landlords from raising rents more than 5% when they renew contracts with ongoing tenants. The law will also increase protections for renters; now, landlords must have “just cause” for evicting a tenant who has lived in the property for more than a year, and no-fault evictions will require the landlord to reimburse their tenant for at least one month’s rent.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AB 1482 will fight rent gouging and unjust evictions to help protect millions of Californians who rent the place they call home,” Assemblymember Rob Bonta(D-Oakland), who helped author the bill, said in a press release. Assemblymembers Bonta, Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and Tim Grayson (D-Concord) also co-authored the bill, while Assemblymember David Chiu (D-San Francisco) is the main author.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) is more skeptical because of the high turnover rate of college renters in Isla Vista compared to long-term tenants in other areas of the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Unander, a lawyer who works with the IVTU, said that due to I.V.’s 94.2% occupancy rate, with 98% of occupants being </span><a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0636868-isla-vista-ca/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she believes landlords will choose not to renew rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have more people looking for housing than we have housing available right now,” Unander said. “So this law is not going to benefit anybody in Isla Vista, probably not anybody in Santa Barbara.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [landlords] have a choice between renewing this tenancy at a lower rent increase or do a new tenancy for more money in a community like ours where there is a low vacancy rate, their better investment is going to be to end that existing tenancy and go with a newer tenancy at the higher rent,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that renters living in housing owned by St. George &amp; Associates, a leasing company with property in I.V., have approached her with concerns regarding their landlord’s reaction to the new law. According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates planned to raise rent 12%, on a unit where five tenants live. Due to AB 1482, the leasing company is considering not renewing the lease and instead looking for new tenants they can legally increase the rent on. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. George &amp; Associates did not immediately respond to request for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite I.V.’s low vacancy rates and consistent supply of tenants, however, it’s expensive for landlords to replace their tenants with new ones, according to Klinton Gibbons, property manager for The Hive IV, a leasing company based in Isla Vista.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If anything it’s going to benefit people who decide to move somewhere and decide to stay there the three or four years of their school. If they move around all four years, then they’re not going to be locked into any sort of rent control,” Gibbons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we were to lose income, we would just make it up from people who don’t renew and raise those rents in order to balance that out,” Gibbons added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gibbons added that it usually costs The Hive IV roughly $1,500 to prepare an apartment for a new tenant, which can be spent on cleaning, painting and replacing broken items in the unit.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many legislators and advocates support rent control, UCSB economist Peter Rupert noted that many economists do not have the same conclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much every economist believes that rent control typically works the opposite than what people hope for,” Rupert said, meaning it decreases the supply of housing rather than adding to it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupert added that California should increase the supply of housing, rather than enact rent control, in order to alleviate the housing crisis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other landlords operating in I.V., such as Sierra Property Management, are considering charging their tenants for utilities, which some currently do not have to pay, as a direct response to AB 1482, according to its President Michelle Roberson.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for evictions, most in I.V. happen due to tenants falling behind on rent, according to Undander, which could fall under the law’s “just cause” requirement in order for a landlord to send an eviction notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was written with the intention of alleviating California’s homelessness crisis, as evictions can send more people to the street with nowhere else to go, according to Chiu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our housing crisis is causing instability for renters across our state,” said Wicks in a press release. “AB 1482 provides some much-needed relief, with stronger protections to keep tenants in their homes — by protecting renters from the most egregious of rent increases and unjust evictions.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Well, the UC Santa Barbara Surf Team is bringing both with their Stoked N’ Broke benefit concert on Oct. 20. Grab a friend or five and head on down to 6559 Segovia Road from noon until 5 p.m. for live music from I.V.’s best local bands, as well as a closing set by guests from San Luis Obispo. For just a $5 entrance fee, you will be automatically entered into a raffle to win prizes such as a surfboard, surf lessons and a private photo shoot, among other rad prizes you don’t want to miss. So don’t sleep on the center of UCSB’s stoke and help keep I.V.’s resident shredders in the water and competing statewide. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Carbs Against Carbon</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love pizza? Hate contributing to a massive carbon footprint? What a coincidence, so does UCSB’s Excursion Club! Isla Vista’s resident outdoor enthusiasts will be hosting a fundraiser at Woodstock’s on Oct. 24 from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. to support the Carbon Fund, a nonprofit leading the fight against climate change. Excursion Club is encouraging all clubs on campus to go carbon-free, and what better way to get that mission across than with pizza?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Beautiful Bodies Clothing Swap</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In honor of Love Your Body Week, the Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP) will be teaming up with the Women’s Center for another one of their famous clothing swaps. Taking place in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m., the event encourages folks of all shapes, sizes and identities to come out and learn all about sustainable clothing practices, as well as how clothing can reflect body positivity. Abiding by the IVTP’s golden rule of “three for free,” attendees will be able to walk away with three free items of clothing. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Have A Laugh!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarcadero Hall will be transformed from dowdy lecture hall to hip and happenin’ comedy club on Saturday night, thanks to Laughology, UCSB’s premiere standup comedy group. Highlighting the show will be Trevor Wallace, who is best known for his “ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws” viral video in support of White Claws (which earned him a cease and desist order from the hard seltzer connoisseurs). The show, which will take place from 8 to 11, is free! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/","id":4244,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4243,4242,4241],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"route":"/categories/news/isla-vista","highestPage":31}},"__N_SSG":true}
