But these national events weren’t just headlines to the students of UCSB; at the time, male college-aged students were being drafted in droves for the Vietnam War, the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill saw an outage that would later lead to the modern environmental movement and four college students had been killed by National Guard soldiers during an anti-war protest at Kent State in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista quickly became a countercultural hub, in part because of the high student population and small-town nature that made the area a breeding ground for political activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just felt like the country was on the verge of a revolution. It was easier to feel that way when we’re all in a center of a refuge of like-minded people like here in Isla Vista,” Steve Byrd, who attended UCSB between 1965 and 1970, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anti-war movement at UCSB and Isla Vista differentiated from movements at other universities during the period, Byrd said, in part because of the violent tensions that led to the burning of the local Bank of America building, the death of a student by the hands of police and the deployment of the national guard by then-governor Ronald Reagan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd, a senior at the time, had a front row seat for it all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He described the hippie movement in the area as “peaceful” — at least until January 1970. The rest of the 1969-1970 academic year was marked by three distinctive phases of rioting, culminating in June with the arrival of the National Guard and the arrest of 10% of Isla Vista’s population one week before final exams, Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event that sparked the violence of 1970 is arguably the most nationally well-known event in the university’s history: the burning of the Bank of America building in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The government was continuing the same old way … they just wouldn’t change. They just kept on doing the same thing, kept on being involved in the same imperialistic overseas wars, no matter how much people protest it.

They broke windows, grabbed furniture out of the building and made a large pile, lighting it on fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately, police from surrounding towns were brought in the area, and Byrd remembers their “aggressive” behavior toward all of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They didn’t know Isla Vista at all, they just knew the stereotypes and they were pissed off. They were pissed off to be here and maybe fearful and scared and they became very aggressive with us, very, very aggressive with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three days, students “ran [the police] out of town,” according to Byrd. But the violence of 1970 was far from over. Just a couple months later, in mid-April, police killed UCSB student Kevin Moran who went to help put out fires started by rioters. Moran shouted, “Don’t shoot at us — we’re putting the fire out!” according to El Gaucho, a former version of the Daily Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Byrd, police initially tried to blame Moran’s death on student snipers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They told all the students snipers had done it for the first several days and things like that. And then it only came out out over time that the police were the one who had actually done it. But then the thing was [the officer] was never indicted for it. He was never indicted even for negligent manslaughter or anything,” Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never had to answer for anything in the criminal justice system, which I guess was real typical. That didn’t set too well, back then at all either.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violence between police and students continued to escalate at college campuses across the country, inflaming already strained tensions at UCSB. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90134\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/screen-shot-2019-10-02-at-9-33-25-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90134\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90134\" data-attachment-id=\"90134\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/screen-shot-2019-10-02-at-9-33-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=876%2C1270&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"876,1270\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-02 at 9.33.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=706%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-90134\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=311%2C451\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=706%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd remembers that he and his friends were stopped by police on a daily basis. This stemmed from a deeper distrust he observed between the older and younger generations during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used to get stopped by the police all the time, you know, just for being young, just for being counter-cultural looking a little bit. I really noticed the difference now that I get older, because I’m just not stopped for no reason like I was when I was young.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During an especially tumultuous period at the end of June, right before finals, over 1,000 people were arrested in Isla Vista for violating a temporary curfew, including Byrd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd recounted his own experience of being arrested for being out past curfew, describing the “aggressive” nature of policing at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The police would go and start ‘bam, bam, bam’ on your apartment door. They’d knocked down the door and to smithereens. And they’d bust in and people would be hiding underneath their beds and in the shower in the bathroom. They’d come and then they say you’re violating curfew after they yanked them outside of their own house and then take them away to jail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd said he was held overnight with “40 people in a cell for four people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were just crammed in like sardines into a cell where you couldn’t even lay down or even hardly sit down,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were violating the Constitution. They were inflicting punishment before trial, before being found guilty, just inflicting their own revenge kind of punishment on arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perceptions of Byrd and students at the time weren’t reflected in the national media coverage over the course of the 1969-1970 year; a New York Times column published in August 1970 described Isla Vista as a “ghetto,” blaming students for the violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The mere words ‘University of California’ on the ballot, in the current public mood, would probably doom a modest subsidy to cure cancer,” columnist Winthrop Griffith wrote at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd believes the media focused solely on the violence, ignoring the peaceful protesting of students and deep political values against the war that motivated their actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a stereotype that sold newspapers. It’s so media, you know, it’s the way the news media always is. They write up the sensationalistic thing to get readership up. And by stirring the pot, by making the young people into the troublemakers and everything, it’s just a stereotype that most older people had,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw the value of the counter cultural revolution, that peace and love and anti-militarism or values, that were worth pursuing, not just because we were young, but they were lifelong values that were worth pursuing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five year-period of history of UCSB’s, and the nation’s country, may as well be a snapshot in history — a time when the country was at war and the culture was rapidly changing. Isla’s Vista’s student-dominant environment stood out against the landscape of Goleta and Santa Barbara, where adults looked down on the “hippie” look and lifestyle of UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All the young people clustered here and they feel like this was their safe space, in Isla Vista,” Byrd said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first came to Isla Vista in 1965, it was a very different place, almost a 1950s preppy place.

And that takes some creativity, some critical thinking skills,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduating from UCSB, Dowd began his career at Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco. Each time he was promoted, however, Dowd said he was reminded of how little he knew about finance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to his lack of knowledge of the field, Dowd was motivated to continue his education at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business to obtain an MBA in finance and accounting. It was there that he discovered the value of an interdisciplinary education in today’s tech-driven economy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really started to appreciate how important data analysis and technology will be going forward in solving problems — not just financial problems, but world problems,” Dowd said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s kind of where I got this idea that we should probably all start incorporating data analysis and technology in how we think about the world and how we creatively solve problems using the tools available to all of us,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Majewski, dean of humanities and fine arts at UCSB and largely involved in the program’s development, feels the Creative Computing Initiative will benefit university graduates as they enter the professional field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With automation and artificial intelligence poised to remake the economy, employment experts expect far-reaching changes in jobs and employment,” Majewski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Majewski feels that skills such as “research experience, communication skills, intellectual empathy, mental flexibility and systems thinking,” all common in the humanities, are crucial for maximum productivity across a variety of fields, including technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Distinguished alumni in the high-tech industry … often point out that their ability to effectively communicate with different groups — whether programmers, consumers or corporate executives — has been critical in their career success,” Majewski said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ability to understand the viewpoints of others, to communicate effectively and to think creatively about problems seem to be in high demand in technology and other industries,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the program’s courses are still in the development stage, students should eventually expect to find classes on topics ranging from computer programming to artificial intelligence — all geared toward humanities students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is going to be invaluable in the next 20 years for kids to, on the one hand, develop critical thinking skills, and on the second hand, be able to understand where technology is headed and utilize that as a great tool,” Dowd said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The other three projects are registering students to vote, educating faculty on alternatives to expensive textbooks and trying to convert the entire UC system to using 100% renewable energy by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last count on Wednesday, the petition to eliminate single-use plastics on UCSB’s campus had 461 signatures, nearly a thousand short of the 1,400 signatures CALPIRG hopes to acquire before the quarter ends and a sliver of the 25,976 students currently enrolled at UCSB.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single-use plastics ban would eliminate items such as straws, utensils and plastic foam take-out boxes distributed by on-campus restaurants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG decided on a petition to ban single-use plastics in order to demonstrate widespread student support for the policy to leaders such as UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang or University of California President Janet Napolitano, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UCs are doing a lot for sustainability, but we think we can do more,” CALPIRG’s Organizing Director Kat Lockwood said. “It would make them a world leader [to ban single-use plastics].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system is already looking into ways to eliminate single-use plastics on campuses by turning to cities with laws minimizing single-use plastics as a model, UC Office of the President (UCOP) Senior Communications Strategist Stett Holbrook said in an email. Berkeley is one such city, which passed a plastic foodware reduction policy in January earlier this year. The UCOP website states that the UCs will ban expanded polystyrene, commonly found in plastic foam take-out containers, by 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system’s Zero Waste 2020 initiative aims to “divert 90 percent of waste from landfills to recycling and composting facilities, not to eliminate waste by 2020,” Holbrook added. However, the UC system currently measured a 69% diversion rate from 2017-18, according to the 2018 Annual Report on Sustainable Practices, with only three months remaining until 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also shows that the UC’s diversion rates have hovered in the high-60 and low-70 percentage points since 2017. Holbrook said the UC’s slowed diversion rates are due to “various internal and external barriers, including turmoil in the international recycling markets and the limitations of local waste haulers.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond eliminating single-use plastics, the UCSB CALPIRG chapter has been working on a project to inform professors about open-source educational resources, or OERs, in an effort to shift professors away from expensive textbooks. When the chapter began the campaign last year, 62 faculty or administration members signed on to show support for it, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of students come up to our textbook tables and tell us things that they’ve had to give up,” Jennifer Manning, fourth-year student and CALPIRG board member, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One student said that her dad had to give up their family car in order to be able to afford to pay for her textbooks for that quarter. So we want to avoid people having to deal with struggles that are unnecessary when they have to purchase, like a $200 textbook, because their professor wanted the newest edition.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Manning and Michel said they were considering pushing for textbook prices to be included on G.O.L.D. when students sign up for classes but were still undecided on whether or not to pursue that initiative.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CALPIRG campaign to get the UCs to run on purely renewable energy is also through a petition, run in the same style as the one banning single-use plastics. Its focus is the heating and cooling units for many on-campus buildings, in addition to the emissions from campus-owned vehicles, according to Manning. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG typically works to sign up college students to vote, but this year, the UCSB chapter will pressure the student government to draft a resolution favoring a voting center on campus that allows </span><a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">same-day registration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is only typically allowed at county elections offices and certain designated satellite locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite her faith that the UCSB community’s values align with CALPIRG’s, Michels admitted that right now, students primarily know them as nuisances with clipboards in the Arbor.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of it is just a misconception of what we do,” Manning said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They just assume that we’re just this annoying group that wants your signature and wants your money without actually understanding the dynamic of how the group actually operates.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a CALPIRG volunteer approaches someone to ask for their signature, their goal goes beyond drawing support for a petition. It’s also to get contact information, pledge money and possibly a new volunteer, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find someone that’s interested enough to sign that petition, we’ll ask them to come to another event, so we kind of just exponentially increase the amount of work we can do,” Michels said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each CALPIRG chapter needs to meet a quota of 10-15% of the student body to donate $10 a quarter. The UCSB chapter has never had an issue meeting that number, according to Manning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is not one of their immediate projects, Lockwood said CALPIRG’s board is interested in implementing their quarterly fee as an official UC campus cost across the system. Michel said that the overall cost per student would be cheaper than the current $10 fee if they implement this change but did not have a new number representing what each student would pay. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wouldn’t have to pester you for money because we wouldn’t have to do our pledge drive,” Manning said. “You want CALPIRG to stop bothering you on the Arbor? Then vote to upgrade our funding.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Students have the option of replacing one of the upper-division art history courses with a portfolio workshop course and a two-unit internship course, according to the minor sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The art history and architecture department already provides three academic options for students looking to pursue art-related endeavors: the core major, the core minor and a minor in museum studies, which was first offered to students in Fall Quarter 2018, according to Savannah Parison, the program advisor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The architecture and urban history minor will allow students with an interest in architecture to pursue an education in the field without having to fully dedicate themselves to the discipline, according to Parison.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The project has been in progress for two years with the aim being student enrollment in Fall [Quarter 2019],” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curriculum committee, who decided on the content of the new minor, included Professor Swati Chattopadhyay, Professor Claudia Moser and Department Chair Mark Meadow, all from the Department of History of Art &amp; Architecture. Although the program was just unveiled at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019, Parison said a couple of students have already come in to declare the minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that the new minor is not exclusive to art history courses; it includes opportunities to take courses within both the geography and environmental studies majors. Both of the aforementioned disciplines offer classes that can be used to fill requirements of the minor, including the geography department’s series on urban or regional planning and the environmental department’s series on sustainable communities, according to Parison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She clarified that the minor would not solely focus on the classical world, but the architecture of multiple styles and time periods as well.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison has already noticed an interest in the minor across a variety of academic fields, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majors that usually wouldn’t express interest in art history given the demands of their coursework.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of interest from engineering students in the past who want to be involved but can’t double major in two colleges but can do the minor relatively easy. It gives them a way to participate and we’ve received lots of support from the engineering departments and advisors,” Parison said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison advises students to meet with her before taking on the minor to determine if it will fulfill their needs and interests, or even if the major may potentially be suited for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not a university that explicitly prepares students to be an architect and this minor is not the best way to qualify for architecture school. This is a minimal step and so discussions need to be had,” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She emphasized that there are opportunities for students interested in a career in architecture, stating students should reach out to faculty member and permanent lecturer Jeremy White who regularly holds workshops on the subject matter. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/","id":1964,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[1963,1962,1961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

CSD), gave an update regarding the room’s condition at the I.V. CSD meeting on Sept. 24. The I.V. CSD normally uses the Community Room to hold its meetings every other Tuesday, but the board meeting relocated to St. George Youth Center due to the air conditioning leaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the two leaks — one in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and the other in the walls from water pipes — were first discovered on Sept. 13. Abboud was then told by Santa Barbara County’s general services that it would be two weeks before the leaks were fixed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, on Sept. 20, Abboud said he was told that the room would be closed indefinitely until a team can come in and inspect it due to mold being discovered in the walls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re fixing the HVAC leak soon, but the leak in the wall with the piping needs to wait for the hazmat to come in. There was mold in the walls because of the leaks,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New cabinets, flooring, drywall and paint are required to repair the damage and Grey hopes to have the room reopened by the last week of October.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bad situation, but I know we’re going to be working hard so the county is getting this done,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V.

</span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/assemblywoman_monique_limon_announces_candidacy_for_state_senate_20190921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced this past

He began his political career as UC Santa Barbara’s Residential Housing Association (RHA) President during the 2012-2013 school year and the Associated Students (A.S.) </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/abboud-named-a-s-president-for-2013-14-as-opp-sweeps-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the 2013-2014 school year. He graduated from UCSB in 2014 with a degree in political science and completed a master’s degree in technology management in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a long-term I.V. resident who has been in the college town since 2010, Abboud’s roots extend beyond the university; he was integral to the campaign that created Isla Vista’s first local government and secured funding for Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and has served as the government’s general manager since Nov. 2017. He also currently serves as a member of the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees and has held the position since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an interview that for the past five years, he’s been “working on strengthening democracy in my town,” referencing his work on the Measures E, F and R campaigns to create and fund the I.V.

id=\"caption-attachment-89947\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Tatum Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for students who have never had access to mental health resources before, whether it’s for financial, cultural or other reasons, Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) can be a student’s first foray into addressing mental health issues — a vital first step that, for some, can be a lifesaver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilary Ochoa, a fourth-year Chicano studies major, just marked her first full year of C.A.P.S. counseling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had always wanted to go [to counseling],” Ochoa said. “I feel like I had a lot of things from my childhood that I wanted to talk about. My home life was never the best, and I struggled with anxiety in high school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa went to C.A.P.S. for the first time during her second year of college, after being referred by Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.). Her first experience with a therapist, however, wasn’t what she had wanted it to be — namely because Ochoa felt like her therapist, a white woman, didn’t understand her and her experiences as a Mexican woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I couldn’t relate to her at all,” Ochoa said. “I found that now that I [have] found a different therapist that I really needed somebody who understood my background.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa didn’t return to C.A.P.S. until the beginning of last summer, after a quarter of academic troubles and the looming threat of academic disqualification. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Ochoa, “going home [wasn’t] an option,” so she decided to spend the summer in Isla Vista and work while she figured out her next steps; during that time, she heard about a new therapist at C.A.P.S., Jessica Adams, who Ochoa said was Puerto Rican and spoke Spanish. She decided to give C.A.P.S. a second chance and booked an appointment with Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like she listened and I felt like she was actually helping me and I felt like I was getting the help that I needed,” Ochoa said. “And that was from the first time that I met her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa noted that Adams was able to “catch onto things that [she] hadn’t told her yet,” which reassured her that her new therapist was a good fit for her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ochoa said she spent her sessions learning to cope with her anxiety and to notice when her depression was getting worse. It’s a victory for Ochoa that she now goes to sessions every few weeks, versus her weekly appointments when she first started out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Adams] has given me a lot of tools to kind of focus and cope with things on my own to get myself out of certain ruts,” Ochoa said, adding that she sees herself continuing counseling after she graduates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reason Ochoa had the opportunity to access therapy was because she was on a college campus, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Talking about mental health] was honestly something new to me,” Ochoa said. “My mom didn’t really talk about that, she was just like, ‘Oh, no you aren’t depressed, you’re just lazy,’ ‘What do you even have to be depressed about,’ or I don’t even think she knows what anxiety is, still.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She comes from Mexico, and it’s a hard thing to talk about… And it’s so easy for her to dismiss mental health.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other students who spoke about their experience seeking mental health help noted that it was the combination of stigma within their families in addition to the financial burden that prevented them from seeking help before they went to college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tatum Katz, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Ecology, Evolution &amp; Marine Biology, first went to therapy as an undergraduate at Occidental College in Los Angeles. At home, her parents didn’t believe in mental illness and she didn’t have insurance, so “it was just not a possibility” for her to get help.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Katz, seeking therapy at Occidental was “more of a reaction to a crisis, and a lack of understanding of myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s continued counseling while at UCSB and now describes mental health as “something that I need to do and need to stay on top of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a physical every year, you get your blood work, you get your shots or whatever, you should do that with your mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But C.A.P.S. doesn’t have to be just for students with long-term mental health problems — for some, C.A.P.S. has helped those who run into crises during their college years, such as Marisol Gonzalez, a fourth-year linguistics major who first went to C.A.P.S. after her close family member had a stroke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was her first time seeking mental health resources and while she doesn’t see herself continuing therapy after college, she said she was glad to be able to take advantage of the resource during the distressing time period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t able to focus on school or just anything. I tried going to class, but I just ended up crying all over campus, and I was just a mess,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interviewees recommended that incoming students try C.A.P.S., many acknowledged how difficult it can be to get appointments and how that may impact students who are asking for help for the first time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. Director Brian Olowude said that the office had recently hired a handful of psychologists and were “constantly looking at [their] available hours” in order to meet student demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that while staff had increased by 50% over the last five years, “initial contacts” with students had increased 127%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is currently working on developing its first-ever annual report, set to be released in the next month or so, which will include information about how many people the office had seen in the past year and what services were provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude said that about 16% of the campus uses C.A.P.S.’s services, compared to the six to 13% of college students who use mental health services on college campuses nationally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say confidently that access to mental health services at UCSB will probably outpace [students’] access in the community when they leave here,” Olowude added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to offering short-term counseling services in their offices, C.A.P.S. also provides community referrals for long-term counseling options in the community — one of which is Acacia Counseling, a clinic in Isla Vista that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/acacia-counseling-wellness-supports-ucsb-students-mental-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solely to provide accessible long-term counseling options for UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main areas that Acacia Counseling specializes in is helping students through the development of their identities through formative college years, which is why it’s important for them to staff their offices with clinicians who reflect the population they serve, Kristen Strong, director of the center, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude also emphasized that, as UCSB is a “minority-serving institution,” it’s important for C.A.P.S. psychologists to be reflective of their diverse clientele. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude and Strong both emphasized that students should take their time finding the right therapists for themselves, and that the first therapist they see may not always be the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You might not fit culturally, you might not fit personality-wise, and that’s not anything necessarily bad,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa echoed Strong and Olowude’s sentiments about putting in the effort to find the right therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially for people of color, I would really suggest to try to find somebody who you can relate to, who looks like you,” she said. “A lot of my mental health issues came from my childhood and growing up… so people not understanding the cultural aspect of a person, I feel impedes you getting the best help that you can get.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

on UCSB’s campus. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Researchers United (ARU) obtained signatures from over 2,200 members across the UC campuses for the petition, which were submitted to each UC campus’s respective chancellors’ offices two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p>“Many [academic researchers (ARs)] are former [postdoctorates] who lost the benefits of having a union when they transferred to an AR position,” McGreal said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARs like McGreal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mentor students and colleagues and run labs daily on UCSB’s campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Neal Sweeney, vice president of UAW Local 5810, explained while academic researchers do much of the same work they did as postdoctorates, they lose the protection of UAW once they transition to titles such as project scientists, specialists, professional researchers and coordinators of public programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sweeney, ARU formed in order to extend the union benefits postdoctorates were awarded to academic researchers after they transition job titles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These new titles were not part of the union. All the gains we had won in our contract for [postdoctorates] like higher salaries, a very good benefits plan, paid parental leave, protections against sexual [harassment] and discrimination, job security </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we lost all of these in the transition,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a union, ARU obtained the signatures needed for a super majority and submitted them to the state labor board in September 2018. After some initial delays, bargaining officially began in May 2019 and has been going on ever since, Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re calling on UC to work quickly to bargain a fair contract that will ensure sustainable research careers and a more equitable, inclusive workplace,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond job security and improved pay, ARs are bargaining for protections against harassment and discrimination in the workplace, along with gender equity and inclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in STEM fields, which most researchers are in, there’s a gender gap,” Sweeney explained. “Having these kinds of protections, like parental leave for example, has been shown to increase retention of women because women aren’t forced to choose between their career and having a family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While delaying the contract “might seem to benefit the university,” Sweeney believes that improving the conditions for ARs at the UCs will ultimately benefit the UC more in the long run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a connection between having better working conditions and doing better work,” he said. “When people feel more secure in their jobs, when they feel like there’s protections from [harassment] and discrimination, when they’re paid at a fair level, they can do better research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Smith, media relations representative in the UC Office of the President, said the office is “working hard to negotiate a fair agreement with the academic researchers as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since this is a brand new contract, it takes some time to reach agreement as we do not have a prior bargaining agreement to work from, and considerable thought and discussion are required in chartering new territory with unique issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Firestone and Akuamoah-Boateng pitched Ugig to a group of other students at the competition, where they met fourth-year political science major Cole Parker, who now acts as the marketing section of their team, and UCSB alumnus Justin Hemphill, who later joined the team to focus on software development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project earned third place and $5,000 to continue developing the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two co-founders were also invited to continue development of the application through the UCSB Office of Research at the Mosher Alumni House and plan to launch a beta version in the fall with both a web and mobile interface, Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are extremely grateful for the Office of Research at UCSB. They have been really gracious and willing to work with and believe in us. We could not think of a better university to start a company at,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair chose the name “Ugig” for several reasons; the ‘u’ represents both the university and the individual by providing a platform for people to profit from sharing personal data. The ‘gig’ part of the name refers to a job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Firestone’s experience as a researcher over the summer, the majority of his time was spent recruiting people for their research studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Opportunities are not widely available for the general public to know about or participate in. So that’s really the first problem that we are trying to address with our app,” Firestone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform, according to Hemphill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parker said that the university system for getting participants is flawed in its effectiveness, but also tarnishes the quality of research produced. The main method for participation is through unpaid course credit completed by students who are often taking multiple classes in that field, which is not representative of the general population, Akuamoah-Boateng explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After interviewing professors and researchers at multiple universities, the Ugig team found it was a common issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a university setting, recruitment is really decentralized, and they are often recruiting primarily from their own department, but they are running studies meant to assess the general population. So our platform is meant to get anyone who wants to contribute to research in the local area,” Parker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig is unique in that it is the first company focused on recruiting sample sizes that better represent the general population, Firestone said. While many departments at UCSB already utilize software for managing research studies, namely Sona Systems, the team has heard from various professors that recruitment is still a challenge, especially outside of each department, according to Firestone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sona does also connect [researchers and participants]. The problem you see with Sona is that they’re not actually actively recruiting. For us, we think it is important to involve and market to the student body, the research that takes place at UCSB,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In reality, we are changing the model, and while disrupting the current technology, are working in such an underserved space,” Firestone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig will be starting small with beta testing before releasing it to the public. The team has the goal of getting almost every study at UCSB on their interface by the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year, Hemphill said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe this app has greater implications for research as a whole. Our mission goes past the university scale,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/","id":3292,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3291,3290,3289],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":25,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
