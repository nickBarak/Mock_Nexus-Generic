Over the past six years, <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2018/06/27/governor-brown-signs-final-state-budget-with-record-rainy-day-fund-school-funding/\">UC has received</a> $1.2 billion in new funding.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 830px; min-height: 530px; border: 1px solid grey;\" src=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/CABudgetUC3.html\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">Data includes total General Fund, special funds, and selected bond funds. Numbers courtesy of the California Department of Finance. <em>Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>The increase of funding to the UC comes following a proposed increase of in-state tuition for UC students across the UC’s 10 campuses. In April, UC President Janet Napolitano announced that the UC <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-will-continue-advocating-more-state-funding-puts-tuition-vote\">would not decide</a> on an increase of in-state tuition at the UC Regents meeting in May and instead would continue to advocate for more state funding.</p>\n<p>On March 15, the UC Board of Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">approved</a> a 3.5 percent tuition increase for out-of-state undergraduate students; however, the regents have yet to vote on an in-state tuition increase as of June.</p>\n<p>In January, Napolitano said the university <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\">is committed</a> to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018.</p>\n<p>Approximately $5 million of the permanent funding will go toward supporting 500 new undergraduate students for 2018-19, according to the senate bill. A portion of the one-time funds could also potentially go toward 2018-19 enrollment growth.</p>\n<p>About $2 million of the one-time funds will be allocated toward efforts to increase diversity amongst faculty, along with $4 million toward legal services for the undocumented community on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Additionally, $1.5 million will go toward addressing student hunger.</p>\n<p>About $35 million of the one-time funds will be used for deferred maintenance and $15.5 million for research, according to the senate bill.</p>\n<p>Napolitano has yet to release a statement on the signed Budget Act, and it is unknown at this time whether the funding was enough to prevent a future in-state tuition increase for UC students.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let’s start with the hard stuff. What does this mean for you the student? I am the first EIC in a long time that has come from the sports section. Because of that, I want to bring more variety to this paper and have a lot more feature-style content across all sections to help all of you students feel more connected to this paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we do a good job of being the voice for students, but I know we can do even better. Each and every one of you on campus has a story, so come to share it with us. Every single voice at UCSB is vital to that change, and, as editor in chief, it is my top priority to incorporate your voices into our journalism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also hope to expand our outreach and find new and creative ways to reach out to students, whether that be through podcasts or another medium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, I want our reporting to stay as great as it has been. We are a newspaper and we are journalists and it is our job to bring you the truth. In a time where “fake news” is as prevalent as hopefully, it will ever be, we want to be a trusted outlet that you can rely on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That doesn’t mean we are perfect. We will make mistakes. We will publish things that not everyone will agree with. This is what comes with being in this business. But know that every single thing we do, we do it because we believe it is the right thing to do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, really quickly, I’d love to take the time by saying how much I love The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining this college newspaper has easily been the best decision of my life. I can honestly say that after three years of college, I would not be who I am right now had I not joined the paper — and most would say I am a pretty pleasant person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For as long as I can remember, sports was always at the forefront of my mind. I loved to play. But after not being blessed with tremendous stature, my hopes of ever playing football at a D-I level were never going to happen, so I decided to write about sports instead!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, only I would have been dumb enough to pick a school that doesn’t have a football team, considering it is my favorite sport, but I think everything worked out all right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better than that though are the people. Everyone I have ever met here has been so kind and wonderful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a better part of two years, I worked with Sean White, as we were both sports editors, and it was the best experience of my life. Usually working with people sucks — we all hate group projects — but working with Sean was incredibly easy. We knew our goal was to grow the section and I think we did that. I wish him the best as he prepares to graduate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important are the three ladies that came before me in this position, Megan Mineiro, Supriya Yelimeli and Maura Fox. I have nothing but respect and admiration for these women listed. If you want to meet kind, hardworking, talented people, then they are perfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three did tremendous things as EIC, not just making sure this place stayed afloat but rather shifting their attention to making this paper the best it can be. I would love to tell you more about each one of them because they are so special, but I only have so much space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is because of them that I am confident in stepping into this role. Three years ago all I wanted to do was write about sports — I never even thought about running for EIC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as I kept growing up, kept learning from these ladies, in particular, I realized my heart was not just in sports, it was in this paper as a whole. I love every single person at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the fact I am leading it means the world to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ever have any concerns, questions or honestly just want to chat, please feel free to come to talk to me. I promise I won’t talk about the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the whole time, I do have a personality outside this place!

Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The measure will impose an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">eight percent user utility tax</a> on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. It will produce a net total of approximately $740,000 per year, according to Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board secretary.</p>\n<p>This was the CSD’s second attempt to secure consistent funding following the failure of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\">Measure F</a> in 2016, which left the CSD without a primary source of funding.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R 2018” campaign – spearheaded by Brandt, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, CSD President Ethan Bertrand and UC Santa Barbara Campus Democrats outgoing President Emily Murray – has been promoting the measure since the end of UCSB’s Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“Throughout this whole process, we’ve organized a group of passionate community volunteers to speak with residents about the issues that matter to them,” Bertrand said. “We knocked on every door in Isla Vista at least three times, some doors we hit up to six times.”</p>\n<p>Most I.V. residents will pay the tax, but Brandt said the CSD is currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75 percent vs. 17.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Approximately 23,000 people live in I.V. as of the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217#qf-flag-X\">most recently conducted</a> census in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>Initial results from the Vote By Mail and Mailed Ballot Results reported 56.34 percent yes votes and 43.66 percent no votes on the measure.</p>\n<p>However, these numbers jumped to 71.04 percent yes votes and 23.64 percent no votes once votes from the first precincts came in. The percentage of yes votes rose throughout the night from there, while the percentage of no votes steadily decreased.</p>\n<p>“We were sort of cautiously optimistic, but when that first polling station came in, and we were up, that was just insane,” Brandt said. “I don’t think any of us believed it…I was crying, I think a lot of us were.”</p>\n<p>Murray, a second-year history and public policy major, shared Brandt’s sentiments.</p>\n<p>“I walked up to Rincon, and Spencer ran out and said, ‘We did it!’” Murray said. “I was overjoyed…when we found out we won by a lot, that was amazing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the CSD’s second attempt to secure funding. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, the pro-Measure R group <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/how-much-are-pro-anti-measure-r-groups-spending-for-your-vote/\">raised</a> $35,630.25 and spent $7,107.67 as of May 19, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByFilerName.aspx\">campaign filings</a> with the Santa Barbara County.

Community Resource Building, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“I’m just elated and so excited for the good work that we can do for the people of Isla Vista, from opening the community center to improving public safety to continuing to work on tenant-landlord issues,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

He graduated from UCSB last year with a degree in history.</p>\n<p>At his Tuesday showing, which marked a year since he took over as the Trivia Night host, it was clear King’s evenhandedness has earned him respect — and even admiration.</p>\n<p>One team name on Tuesday was, “Robbie is a Tender Lover.” Another dubbed itself, “Leave Robbie Alone!”</p>\n<p>“People won’t believe that I’ll actually say that over the microphone,” King laughed.</p>\n<p>Unlike I.V.’s other evening draws, like the discounted premium beer at Woodstock’s Wednesday pint nights, Trivia Night gives Isla Vistans something to do. There are endless pitchers of beer sold during the event, but the evening’s lure isn’t rooted in drinking alcohol for its own sake.</p>\n<p>There’s also no politeness among strangers here; adjacent booths become fast enemies and tables break into conspiratorial huddles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a part of I.V. culture that isn’t just drinking,” King said. “Sure, there’s plenty of drinking, but it’s all about interactions people are having. It’s competition — friendly, most of the time. I really love doing it because I have a good energy about it and people come in here with a good energy about it.”</p>\n<p>Themed events generate the biggest crowds. One night saw all of the questions styled around the television series “The Office.” So many showed up that some groups scurried onto the floor while participants leaned in over the patio rail. Another five-week derby went, decade by decade, from the 1960s through the 2000s. I.V. packed the house, even during UCSB’s Dead Week.</p>\n<p>But the bare-bones, general-knowledge questions are the real challenge, especially when King reaches for topics just out of the average attendee’s grasp.</p>\n<p>One of his favorite questions from the event’s history? “What do you call a female sheep?’” he said. The subject seems banal, but the answer would elude many: an “ewe.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people thought they should know that but didn’t, so I got like several, ‘This question sucks,’ ‘Fuck this question,’ ‘I can’t believe you asked this,’” King recalled. “I didn’t realize the ewes generate so much controversy.”</p>\n<p>King deep-dives into Wikipedia each week to come up with a balanced spread of head-scratchers. What drew him toward the event as a freshman, he said, was the element of “mental prowess.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a funny sort of knowledge, really,” he said. “I get like a lot of little tiny details about things.”</p>\n<p>In a year of running the show, King has absorbed his fair share of trivia. In fact, he can now tell you which team appeared in the most Super Bowls during the 1990s.</p>\n<p>“How useful is that? I don’t know, but now I have that filed away.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/","id":3648,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[3647,3646,3645],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter From the Editor: For Fox Sake, 4 Years Sure Flew By","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-07-at-1.37.20-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-07-at-1.37.20-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I’m a little confused by it all, to be honest; how do four years go by so quickly?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There is something inherently strange about goodbyes.

I was unhappy, and I didn’t have a place to call home on campus or in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how things change.</p>\n<p>I’ve been struck with flashbacks to specific moments at UCSB — like when my roommate, Raechel, and I ran around the lagoon for the first time freshman year, or when I canoed down the Colorado River with the Adventure Programs, or even when I walked through I.V. on one particular Saturday morning, soaking in the pure, hungover magic of it all.</p>\n<p>Over the years, these are the moments that have made me love UCSB, but I can’t tell you enough how much stepping into the <em>Nexus</em> office for the first time changed my life.</p>\n<p>It’s a dark, cold office with too much stale coffee but the perfect amount of old newspapers and dusty books. The people are warm and intelligent, without fail, every passing year and with each new class.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also does this thing that I love: It preserves memories and moments with every photo, every article and every Thursday print issue. And I hope the <em>Nexus</em> continues to be an emblem for our community, long after I’m gone and I am only left with the memories.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> and the people I have met during my time on staff have shaped the person I am today, but the <em>Nexus</em> continues to grow itself. I encourage you to be patient as Nexites learn more about themselves and the kind of journalists they want to be.</p>\n<p>I know we don’t always get it right. We won’t always get it right. It is our job as storytellers to listen to our community and fellow students to ensure that the history we’re preserving is accurate, its people accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>Jorge Mercado, the next editor in chief, is kind and capable, and will slip a sports reference into most any conversation, if given the opportunity. I hope you pop into his office to chat — his door is always open.</p>\n<p>Goodbyes are strange, but reporting on our community for the <em>Nexus</em> has assured me that I can always reflect on our shared moments documented in archives and stamped onto history. Maybe it’s not even goodbye, after all, its merely the passing of one era and on to the next.</p>\n<p>Thank you to every interviewee, to the dear <em>Nexus</em>, to my best friends and #roommate4life. And to you, UCSB, thanks for making me want to stick around.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/","id":3656,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3655,3654,3653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bong, Bong, Bong: The Hands Behind the Carillon Bells","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3472.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3472.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As a member of Adjunct Professor Margo Halsted’s carillon bells class, Sophia Tao has spent the last two years making the trek up the tower at least once a week to play the bells.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Drunken bets, gate-hopping and Google searches for “how to hotwire the elevator”: UC Santa Barbara students spend their college careers plotting different ways to get to the top of Storke Tower before they graduate.</p>\n<p>Sophia Tao, a fourth-year pharmacology major, is one of the lucky few who has been to the top.

It is typical for students to already be proficient piano players when they enter the course.</p>\n<p>Halsted has been working with Tao and two other students, Iris Xie, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, and David Hwang, a material sciences graduate student, since 2016.</p>\n<p>All three students will be graduating this spring.</p>\n<p>Tao and Xie will have the opportunity to play the carillon for approximately ten minutes each before joining their fellow graduates at their respective ceremonies, while Halsted is slated to play during the remaining thirty minutes.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] kinda nervous because there’s actually gonna be a ton of people listening. During the weekend, it’s pretty empty, so it’s less nerve-wracking, I guess,” Tao said. “I definitely have to practice.”</p>\n<p>Currently, the three students trade off playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. During the weekdays, there isn’t a suitable “window of time” where they can practice since classes run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Tao said.</p>\n<p>While most traditional carillon songs are “not really recognizable,” Tao still enjoys playing ones that are more up-tempo because the bells ring more distinctly.</p>\n<p>“[Students] play music written for carillon… arrangements of music for other instruments, their own compositions and arrangements and popular songs that UCSB students like to hear,” Halsted said in an email. “Everyone loves to hear music they already know.”</p>\n<p>“I know someone played the Harry Potter theme, some people played the Pokémon theme song. We, once, last year I think, played the Rick Roll song during April Fools,” Tao said.</p>\n<p>Tao said she decided to audition for Halsted’s class her freshman year after a friend recommended it to her.</p>\n<p>“I thought it would be really cool to be a part of this huge landmark of our school,” Tao said. Before playing the carillon for the first time, Halsted’s students start off on a piano and then transition to a practice keyboard that is similar in structure to the carillon.</p>\n<p>Tao’s 15 years of piano playing translated smoothly to playing the carillon, despite the added component of playing with one’s feet in addition to their hands. The carillon is also played with fists rather than fingers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83469\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83469\" data-attachment-id=\"83469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/bong-bong-bong-the-hands-behind-the-carillon-bells/img_3476/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3476\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83469 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The carillon differs from the piano in that players use their fists rather then their fingers.

Over the course of a year, the students worked on submitting both video and audio recordings of their playing, receiving feedback from the judges and using that feedback to improve and resubmit their applications.</p>\n<p>While the students had the ease of working at their own pace throughout this process, Tao recalled how long it took and how eager she was to be certified. She began preparing for the certification during the Winter Quarter of her junior year and was recently certified at the beginning of Winter Quarter this year.</p>\n<p>Halsted’s students were able to travel to UC Berkeley and UC Riverside to play their carillons as well as host UC Berkeley’s Guild for a recital on campus, Tao said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to see them talk about all this… like the history, the people who’ve played it, the music,” Tao said. “There’s actually so much [history] behind it and even so much history behind the people who make the bells.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83467\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83467\" data-attachment-id=\"83467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/bong-bong-bong-the-hands-behind-the-carillon-bells/img_3461/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3461\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83467 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three students alternate playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. <em>Sanya Kamidi/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tao reached out to a former carillon student of Halsted’s who now plays at Trinity Cathedral in San Jose, California, Tao’s hometown, and hopes to be able to continue to play the instrument there.</p>\n<p>“I’m just really happy that I had this experience, and it’s something that I’ve done a really long time,” Tao said. “It’s one of the defining activities and memories I have of UCSB.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
