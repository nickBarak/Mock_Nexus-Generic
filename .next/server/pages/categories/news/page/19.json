Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) served a search warrant on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by SBSO Saturday morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the search, detectives recovered numerous items that were taken during the robbery and they arrested two suspects,” Raquel Zick, SBSO spokesperson, said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meteke was charged with robbery and false imprisonment and booked on a $100,000 bail, while Hebbar faces accessory charges with a $20,000 bail. Hebbar is a UCSB student, according to the student directory; Meteke’s custody logs state he is a student, but the name of the college he attends is not listed.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2 p.m. on Saturday, Meteke is still in custody, according to custody logs. Hebbar is no longer in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investigation is ongoing, Zick said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p>No further suspects have been arrested as of Monday, Zick told the Nexus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown whether the police have located the third suspect involved in the incident.

Life website. <em>Courtesy of Shoreline Website</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), facilitated the initial change from paper information to OrgSync and now from OrgSync to Shoreline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he first started working at UC Santa Barbara in 2007, “the department was all paper — registration was on paper, financial transactions were paper, nothing but paper,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a simple online event-planning form that we used that we actually had to do in person with every single organization creating an event, but it was developed in the ‘90s, so the functionality was really limited,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL then recognized a need for “a 21st-century system for student engagement” to digitize its process, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When OSL first began to pursue digitized options, OrgSync was one of three software choices reviewed by OSL. As time went on, OrgSync was no longer properly serving the evolving needs of students from feedback the OSL had received, Ashlock said. Student organizations had trouble navigating the website and were not able to create their own sites, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSL began to look at different software options and found a program called CampusGroups, also known as Shoreline, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a student-engagement platform that doesn’t just serve the OSL, but it also serves departments in Student Affairs and across the campus and therefore is an engagement platform for every student,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from OrgSync to Shoreline had its fair share of problems, such as delays in shifting the information of organizations to the new platform, Ashlock said. The data renewal process took place last spring through a Google Form where current organizations could sign up and update their contact information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unfortunately, we lost information for about 10 organizations,” Ashlock said. “We had reached out to them on multiple occasions to invite them to complete full registration in Shoreline and up to nearly 400 organizations have. We did mention that we did contact those organizations and say, ‘You have this much time to save your website data from OrgSync, but you will lose it otherwise.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said another issue limited the number of graduate students listed, but the problem has since been fixed and graduate students are now included in the database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the faculty and staff are being loaded onto the platform this week as well, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL is also working toward using Shoreline to create a more functional check-in system for when a group hosts an event. Ashlock estimates that this new feature will be ready at the end of the quarter when OSL is finished with data integration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new check-in system will offer five different ways to sign into an event, depending on the event organizer, who can enable whichever option they choose, according to Ashlock. Students will be able to check in with a QR code provided through the Shoreline app or they can scan a QR code posted at the event; alternatively, they can scan, swipe or tap their Access Card for entry, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a lot of versatility and all of those options can exist side by side,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone with an Access Card is going to be able to check-in and keep a log of events that they’ve attended.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shoreline website is currently available online for students, and an app is in development, which will provide access to student groups and student resources, such as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho On-Line Data (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.O.L.D.), GauchoSpace and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Accounts Receivable Collections (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BARC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s basically an instant messaging platform that merges student engagement and student resources,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we developed this app, we’re looking to create, even if it’s not just a single app, a more seamless environment where students can really go and get all the information they need in an efficient way.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article <span class=\"__in\">appeared</span> on page 5 of the Nov. 21, 2019 <span

program sent an email to students last Friday “strongly urging them to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible.” </span><em>Courtesy of Emma Xing</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-13/uc-study-abroad-suspends-spring-hong-kong-program-citing-safety-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Wednesday that the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) was cancelling its spring study abroad programs amidst concerns for student safety and was considering evacuating its 79 Fall 2019 study abroad students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, the program decided to leave the decision to leave Hong Kong up to the students themselves.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP spokesperson Myla Edmond said the program sent an email to students last Friday “strongly urging them to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible,” adding that UCEAP was uncertain if local transportation and the airport would be affected — another cause of concern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edmond declined to specify the number of students who were leaving and the number who were staying, citing privacy concerns, but said that UCEAP had heard from all of the students who were abroad and confirmed that many of them would be leaving Hong Kong in the coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only a few who had family in the area would be staying, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP will be covering all the costs of changing travel plans, Edmond said. However, one of the biggest pieces of information is still up in the air: whether or not students will receive their course credits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We definitely don’t want them to lose an entire term due to issues that have nothing to do with them; it’s beyond their control,” Edmond said. “Some of them will be taking online courses, so we’re still trying to work out the details for that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that each student’s academics would be dealt with by the universities they were attending in Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several universities </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut their semesters short last week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without coordinating with students and instructors about completing courses for the term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anita Carraher, a third-year environmental studies major who was studying abroad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong this semester, said in an interview with the Nexus on Sunday that she was still waiting to hear from several professors about how she would be able to finish her courses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Hong Kong University announced that they would be having online classes, and most other universities have also announced some type of either online form of classes or have also just cancelled classes, but specifically with Chinese University [of Hong Kong], they cancelled classes before they decided how they were going to finish up the semester,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 11, the Chinese University of Hong Kong cancelled classes for the day; later that night, they also cancelled classes for Tuesday, and on Tuesday, classes were cancelled for Wednesday, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Wednesday, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amidst violence at the edge of campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that the university cancelled classes for the entire term.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Chinese University of Hong Kong — where the university is made up of several different independent colleges — it has been more difficult to coordinate course completions, especially since each college has its own protocols, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students on campus were evacuated from their dorms, while others like Carraher were not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher is currently staying with family in Hong Kong but said that she has heard from other students that coordinating housing during the time period has been difficult, particularly for students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where students were not allowed to return to campus due to high concentrations of tear gas chemicals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the university had been working with students to arrange off-campus housing for students up to Wednesday, after which they were expected to leave Hong Kong or secure their own housing, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher, whose stay with family was initially meant to be temporary, had left all her belongings on campus. As of Sunday, she was waiting to hear whether she could return to campus to retrieve her luggage. On Wednesday, she said she would be traveling around Asia for a few weeks and would try to return to campus later in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before she arrived in Hong Kong, Carraher said there had been talk about whether or not the exchange program would be cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] a really different look now, comparing those protests [over the summer] to what’s happening now. It’s definitely gotten more and more extreme, especially when it [has] come to police treatment, of not just students, but to me, I thought the most alarming thing most of the time was police treatment of press,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although students studying abroad in Hong Kong received messages from friends back home asking about their safety, Carraher and two other UCSB students in Hong Kong, Rita Lake and Emma Xing, maintained that as long as they stayed informed about where protests were occurring, they weren’t particularly in danger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Besides the transportation thing, the protests haven’t really affected us that much because exchange students mainly don’t really protest or get involved in any of this, and as long as you don’t get involved, you’re not really in any sort of danger,” Xing said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lake, a fourth-year political science and art history double major, and Xing, a third-year history and philosophy double major, were studying at Hong Kong University when the roads to campus were blocked by protestors. Once classes were suspended and UCEAP emailed them recommending they leave Hong Kong, Lake and Xing went to China to stay with Xing’s grandparents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two are currently completing classes online, and Lake noted that her professors have been “really accommodating,” particularly since many of her courses had relied on group projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they finish up their coursework, Lake and Xing plan to spend the rest of their semester in China before their previously scheduled trip to Thailand in mid-December, after which they’ll be returning to the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of my friends have been asking me, ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Stay safe,’ and I guess I just wanted to say that I was never really in danger in the first place,” Xing said. “I think we’re really privileged to be able to leave the situation, because obviously if you’re a Hong Kong student, if you’re a Hong Kong resident, you can’t leave the situation because that’s your home.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel very privileged to be able to leave.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11/29]: The story has been updated to remove references to Hong Kong as a country; <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/topics/reference/hong-kong-history-explain-relationship-china/?fbclid=IwAR2ofMqoKoDbZjgl4Cr7feqazjNSX9bjrDDoX3KqQDrnhRSJjkj2ONQdmRY\">while it operates</a> as its own country, it is technically a territory of China.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a booking report obtained by the Nexus, Tucker Steil, a third-year anthropology major, was arrested between 11 p.m. and midnight by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and held on a $2,500 bail after officers responded to reports of a “fight brewing” at “6598 Pardall Rd (Rockfire Grill).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steil is a transfer student in his first quarter at UCSB. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p>Steil had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-23/ucsb-student-arrested-for-isla-vista-assault-previously-arrested-for-beating-of-rival-frat-member-at-mississippi/\">also been previously arrested</a> for assault in Mississippi in 2015, when he was a freshman at the University of Mississippi.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon arrival, officers arrested Steil, who had “blood on his clothing.” The victim was bleeding from their lip following the altercation with Steil, according to the booking report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the booking report, a witness at the scene spoke to the officers, stating that they saw the “victim and &amp; Steil (suspect) fighting/throwing punches and that the word ‘faggot’ was being exchanged.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Oscar Perez, a second-year UCSB student who spoke to the Nexus, Perez was walking to Rockfire Grill when he and his group of friends were approached by a man </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who Perez later identified as Steil — with blood on his shirt, who began following them. The man also called one of Perez’s friends a homophobic slur, Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t know what he was going to do so we were just telling him ‘Go home.’ Everyone was telling him to go home. We were all thinking he was going to fight us, but he didn’t,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the man left, a woman approached them “checking for blood on our hands,” Perez added. Perez pointed out the man who had been following them to the woman, who she then ran up to. She was looking for the man who was “saying all the bad stuff about homosexuals,” according to another student present at the scene who requested to remain anonymous and verified Perez’s recounting of the events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the man punched her and began kicking her while she was on the ground; a fight then began between an unknown number of people in the middle of Pardall Road, near Six Pak Shop, according to the unnamed student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once detained, Steil admitted to officers that he used the word “faggot” during the altercations and that he had consumed multiple alcoholic beverages that night, according to the booking report; the report also stated that “[Steil] was determined to be the aggressor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A person who identified themselves as a victim of the incident posted on Twitter detailing their injuries: “The word ‘FAGGOT’ cost me a concussion, 7 stitches, a fractured nose, and 3 broken teeth,” they said, adding that one of the women assaulted also had a hand broken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also stated that they will be “taking all actions necessary to have [the attacker] face all possible consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chancellor, judicial affairs, and anywhere else. Enough is enough. There is no room for hate, only love,” one of the tweets read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because news of the Rockfire altercation spread quickly through social media, many students and community members had learned about the situation through unofficial channels, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Ethan Bertrand said at the Nov. 12 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand addressed the incident and criticized the lack of communication between the community and public safety agencies when serious situations arise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s absolutely maddening that members of this board and members of the community heard about this through Twitter and not from our public safety agencies who respond to this. And I say that it’s maddening because we’ve dealt with this before,” Bertrand said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unacceptable and offensive as a member of this Isla Vista LGBTQ community to have this go on and for it to not be worthy of public attention and not to be worthy of a serious community response.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the board discussed the availability of I.V. CSD press releases to the public, one student — who said they are friends with one of the victims in the Rockfire incident — echoed Bertrand’s thoughts regarding the critical role that widely available information plays in the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that multiple sexual assaults have occurred this past month and there was a hate crime against someone who’s actually very near to my heart, it is not okay that we don’t have people standing up for us,” said the student, who did not identify themselves at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing a press release with transparency would be really helpful to the community to help us heal. Having all these incidents back to back to back has been a lot for a lot of different students and showing survivors that there are these resources that you provide as our government on a local level would be very beneficial,” the student continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at the Nov. 13 Associated Students Senate meeting, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi also spoke about the altercation and described the incident as a “homophobic hate crime.” She added that one of the victims sustained a concussion, seven stitches and a broken jaw.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to advocate for this,” she said. “Not because this person asked me to but because hate crimes in our community aren’t something we expect, because we believe that everyone is open minded.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have to remember there are some people in our community who do hold that hate in their heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadidi called for more transparency between law enforcement, the university and its students, telling the Senate that, “I think it’s a little bit unacceptable that some of you are looking at me like you’re hearing this for the first time and that we haven’t heard about it as a community from our administration.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, on Nov. 14, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead sent an email to all students regarding a “physical assault” incited by “homophobia, racism, and/or xenophobia.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We find acts of violence intolerable, and those motivated by bias rooted in homophobia, racism, and other oppressive prejudices particularly despicable,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB administration is currently in contact with those involved, according to the email, and said the absence of a Timely Warning was a result of the crime occurring on a location not covered by the Clery Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email included a promise from administrators to keep a clear line of communication with students regarding safety concerns.

and cover the 16.7 acres of land up and down the street with up to 540 housing units — 180 two- and three-bedroom townhomes for sale and 360 rental units.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an unmet and sustained need for faculty and staff housing at UCSB, which has been exacerbated by Santa Barbara’s constrained and high-cost housing market,” the proposal wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The need for attainable, high-quality housing options remains a critical issue for recruitment and retention of faculty and staff at UCSB.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the proposal doesn’t specify the proposed costs of these units — only highlighting that they would be set at a “reasonable, market-based average sale price” —  it does note that according to a third-party site, home prices in Santa Barbara and Goleta over the last 30 days averaged $1.2 million, and that the average rent for the past five years was approximately $2,249, with a 98% occupancy rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal noted that of the current faculty and staff housing options provided by UCSB, both </span><a href=\"https://www.oceanwalk.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ocean Walk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made up of for-sale properties, and Sierra Madre Apartments, made up of rental properties, are at 100% capacity. The wait list for Ocean Walk housing is at 185 people, and the Sierra Madre waitlist had been capped at 200.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In addition to providing clear indications of interest and demand, survey responses also confirmed long commute times (over 45 minutes) and distances (over 25 miles) for a significant number of faculty and staff, further highlighting the need for housing options close to campus,” the proposal wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key differences of this project, compared to typical UCSB housing projects, is that it will include “30,000 to 55,000 gross square feet of retail space.” The university hopes to help alleviate the costs of the townhouses and apartments through a subsidy program, which will be funded, in part, by the “ground rent” generated by the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rental and retail portions of the Project are expected to be developed, owned, and managed under a long-term ground lease,” the proposal stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the housing and retail space, the proposal said that the project would include “realignment of the existing Ocean Road roadway and physical improvements for connections to Isla Vista, new and replacement parking for the community, and open space, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian pathways.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91421\" style=\"width: 1030px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2018 article by The Current</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a publication run by UC Santa Barbara’s public affairs office, boasted that the project would create a “dynamic residential community” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">redefine the border between Isla Vista” — but that is exactly the problem that Isla Vistans had with a former version of the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly 15 years ago, in 2005, campus planners </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2005-10-26/project-renovates-ocean-road-to-aid-in-traffic-housing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a similar Ocean Road housing plan, which would involve 536 units divided into apartments, lofts and townhouses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was reported at the time that construction was scheduled to begin in 2007, but in 2009, the university postponed its attempt to demolish Ocean Road amidst severe public pressure to halt the project, the Nexus</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-01-28/officials-pause-ocean-road-proposal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2009</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-05/vision-2025-apt-to-give-ucsb-bad-eyesight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">op-ed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the university’s previous attempt denounced the 2009 program, noting that the project would involve tearing down the famous eucalyptus trees that line Ocean Road; similarly, in recent months, a few citizens have shown up to Isla Vista Community Services District meetings expressing similar concerns about the trees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the current plan is approved, Student Health would also need to be relocated from its current location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2018 Current piece also said that “input from people both on and off campus will again be crucial, and multiple opportunities for such public discussions will be provided and welcomed every step of the way” — but no such publicization of the project has been prevalent until the Regents meeting last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outreach and community engagement were central to the original Ocean Road proposal and project approval, and they will remain important considerations throughout the project planning stage and beyond,” UCSB spokesperson Shelly Leachman said in an email about the project in June 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leachman added that the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of UCSB Community Housing Authority on campus had administered a survey to students, staff and faculty earlier in the year regarding the Ocean Road Housing project, and that the office planned to conduct additional surveys as the project planning continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, the university will prepare an addendum to the 2010 LRDP Environmental Impact Report. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat addendum, along with designs, will be considered for approval by the UC Regents in a public meeting in January 2020.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal presented to the Regents updated that timeline, confirming that the UC Regents would be presented with the business terms for the project in the first financial quarter of 2020, and the design plans and “an environmental document pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act” in the second or third quarter of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is “is currently in the final stages of a robust solicitation process” to select the developer for the project, according to the proposal, after which it will be able to “finalize the key business terms for the Project and to implement predevelopment agreements to finalize design, planning, entitlements, and Project approvals.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-91417\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ora spoke at the Nov. 13 Regents meeting, accusing Kieffer of sexual misconduct against her in 2014. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents Video.</em></p></div>\n<p>During the board meeting’s public forum, Ora, the external vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, accused Kieffer of grabbing her thigh numerous times throughout a dinner between Kieffer and various undergraduate and graduate students, held prior to the Regents’ board meeting in July 2014.</p>\n<p>“Kieffer purchased wine for the table despite the undergraduate students present. I do not drink and did not drink that night, but Kieffer did,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the conversation, I was shocked to feel pressure on my upper thigh and looked down incredulous to find Kieffer’s hand firmly grasping my leg. This persisted throughout the evening. I was unsettled, uncomfortable and felt powerless to stop this figure of authority from putting his hands on my body.”</p>\n<p>Kieffer, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, has served on the Board of Regents since 2009, and his term is set to end in 2021.</p>\n<p>UC spokesperson Claire Doan said in an email that due to student privacy laws, she could not comment on specific allegations raised at the board meeting but said the University of California “takes these allegations — as we do any allegations — seriously.”</p>\n<p>Ora’s testimony also shines a light on the difference between the University of California and the UC Regents when it comes to handling sexual misconduct allegations — all decisions regarding Regent misconduct are handled by the Regents themselves, according to <a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/1112.html\">Regents Policy 1112</a> .</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus that she has experienced instances of sexual misconduct before but said the power differential between herself and Kieffer limited her voice in the reporting process.</p>\n<p>“I was in a train station and somebody put his hand on my behind and squeezed, and I turned around and punched him in the stomach. That is who I am. But when you’re sitting next to somebody who’s talking about being best friends with [former California Governor] Jerry Brown, and you’re in a public space, you can’t punch him in the stomach,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“The difference in power among people determines the type of response they’re capable of having in that moment. And I know it’s opening up a huge amount of complexity, but when a power differential was so steep that you literally cannot stand up for yourself, that makes whatever is occurring so much worse.”</p>\n<p>Ora said that she is the first person to go through the Regents misconduct investigation process, described in Regents Policy 1112, which outlines the specific policy for allegations of misconduct against a Regent.</p>\n<p>“Apparently the UC Regents have a policy all their own, written by the Regents, which states that all complaints against a Regent will be handled by the Regents … with a clear focus on ensuring the utmost delicacy toward the powerful Regent reported, rather than the individual reporting,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“In the words of a Title IX employee, ‘In the Regents policy, I, the complainant, do not even exist.’”</p>\n<p>In response to Ora’s allegations, UC Student Association, the UC Graduate and Professional Council and the UC Council of Student Body Presidents published a joint statement on Nov. 20, supporting Ora and condemning the process for reviewing misconduct cases against the Regents.</p>\n<p>“We believe Rebecca, and we agree that the process for reviewing her case is deeply flawed. Regents Policy 1112 essentially requires Regents to hold themselves accountable by tasking a three-member panel of Regents to oversee an investigation. This is not survivor-centered, trauma-informed, impartial, or just, and it clearly prioritizes the powerful over those who may have been harmed,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The leaders further called on the Regents to adhere to the same Title IX policies as students, staff and faculty, calling for further accountability by state elected officials.</p>\n<p>Ora first spoke during a June 2018 Regents meeting about her general experiences navigating Title IX as a graduate student — not relating to Kieffer — and was approached by someone following her comments.</p>\n<p>Ora said she had told the person about what had reportedly happened with Kieffer in 2014, when he let her know that he was a “responsible employee,” also known as a mandated reporter, which means he is required by UC Title IX Policy to report Ora’s story as an instance of “sexual violence, sexual harassment or other conduct prohibited by the policy to the Title IX officer or designee.”</p>\n<p>Ora was given a few options by the case’s mediator: pursue a case against Kieffer, or let it go. If she pursued a case, she would have to decide whether to go directly into an investigation against Kieffer or attempt to settle through the internal alternative resolution process, where a mediator would handle the case directly with the appointed Regents.</p>\n<p>“Even though I’ve been a student leader for so many years, it took me this horrendous conversation to realize like, ‘Oh, wow, I do need to follow this through,’ because it’s not a matter of whether I’m okay or not and how many meetings I have to step out of and avoid. It’s a matter of somebody with such lax judgment is determining the consequences of all of the perpetrators in the system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>During public forum last week, Ora said she was encouraged at the time of reporting to “informally resolve the matter so as to avoid an investigation” and said in the interview that she felt pressured then by the case’s mediator to first handle the case internally.</p>\n<p>“I was given no direction and I had no idea what to choose, so I just chose the one that seemed the safer one.”</p>\n<p>But Ora said that earlier this year, the alternative resolution to handle the case internally failed. She described the Regents’ response to her allegation as “deeply disappointing.”</p>\n<p>“They were so invisible on any item that was clear to me that there was no use bothering to continue negotiation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ora’s case will now move on to the outside investigation process.</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus she chose to speak during public forum due to frustration not only with the Regents’ system, but the entire University of California process for investigating sexual misconduct, which takes years and often re-traumatizes the person reporting sexual misconduct in the process.</p>\n<p>“We should have a system that doesn’t discourage and exhaust people who stand up for themselves and what’s right. And in order to protect other people, we should have a system that encourages them. This is not that system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>At public forum, Ora discussed how the years-long investigation process has personally affected her, specifically her mental health and relationships.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been told not to bother trying to fix the world and told to let it go. I’ve been excluded from committees because of Kieffer’s presence, I experience regular panic attacks and have fallen behind in my academic progress. I’m afraid of being hacked and of being harassed and followed, as I’m aware other [people who reported sexual misconduct] have been. I had to move, I’ve lost friends and relationships,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Until now, I’ve tried to follow the appropriate process, but it has failed because it is fatally flawed,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“I know that all the headlines have been about someone accuses someone of something. And I do think that is a problem, like yes, somebody did something to me … it did harm me.

Alia Reynolds, president and UCSB coordinator of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), led conversation with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel discussed plans to further educate students on sexual assault prevention, including expanding mandatory sexual violence and harassment training to all clubs and sports teams and putting trainings online through GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key distinction between SASA and UCSB’s position about what action to take in light of recent allegations is the university’s mutual no-contact orders, which state that neither respondent or survivor can be near one another in shared public spaces. SASA, per Reynolds, claimed during the town hall that this prohibits survivors from accessing areas integral to their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA supports California Senate Bill 493, which, as Reynolds explained in the meeting, aims to ensure that sexual assault survivors have equal access to education through the abolition of mutual no-contact orders and resources for survivors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC currently does not support the abolition of mutual no-contact orders, SASA explained during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the panel discussion, Tallin Moyer, a member of SASA and Pi Beta Phi sorority, read a statement on sexual violence in Greek life and requested updates on other concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Greek life can provide a facility for leadership and self-growth — however, it is unacceptable that we as a Greek community have not realized the true magnititude of how our system enables sexual violence,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of Greek life need to realize how fraternities foster rape culture and put individual safety at risk. It is unacceptable to think these events have occurred in a vacuum.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public comment, one Greek life-affiliated student voiced her concerns about Sigma Pi’s participation in Arrowjam, an annual dance competition hosted by sorority Pi Beta Phi in order to raise money for Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve — a charity dedicated to children’s literacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moyer, whose sorority hosted the philanthropy, told the student that she understood the concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree with you, that was not taken into consideration at all, and I hear you, that it could be triggering to see them up there … It was the opinion of some of the women in our sorority that not all the men in Sigma Pi should be punished for the actions of a few. But I totally understand the concern, and [we] will be talking to our president about it,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigma Pi went on to compete and win the fraternity portion of the competition, which occurred on Nov. 8, eight days before the SASA Town Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA also promoted its Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map at the town hall. The map, facilitated by SASA, includes the UCSB campus and surrounding Isla Vista community. Anyone can anonymously report instances of sexual violence or harassment, which are pinned onto the digital map. Yellow pins stand for one report at a location and red stands for multiple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s mostly faith-based, although I am cautious about calling it that, but we are in the sense of believing survivors. But we see everything that goes through, and we monitor it closely,” Moyer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds then inquired to administrators about the Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) training email, which was sent to the entire student body on Nov. 1, soon after a timely warning email was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a reported sexual assault at Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally were concerned about the timeliness of the email about R.A.D., because obviously it was sent out during a very triggering, emotional time for many students,” she said. “The email only served to increase these feelings. We were also concerned that the email mentioned only women, which seemed to exclude men and gender non-conforming folks.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ollman, representative for SBSO, explained that while the timing of the email was unfortunate, it had already been scheduled and pre-selected. R.A.D. training is heavily overviewed by the national organization and leaves little room for individual departments to change gender pronouns or create more inclusive wording, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation regarding email alerts for the student body was another topic of discussion throughout the town hall. UCSB has two forms of communication for alerts: emergency notifications and timely warnings, which fall under Clery Act jurisdiction. The Clery Act mandates public safety reports on specific crime categories, including sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency notifications are “designed to give information about ongoing threats,” UCPD’s Community Service Officer Ariel Bournes explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Timely Warning Notices fall under a different, highly specific category of warning, and failing to issue one that meets the criteria means a potential fine of up to $57,300, according to Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we become aware of something that violates the Clery Act, we are mandated to report it, simply because a report has been filed and not because it has been investigated. The university is mandated to send Clery warnings only about Clery crimes that occur on university property… it’s a really bizarre, unique set of circumstances,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also inquired about the safety prevention tips issued in one such timely warning, including covering one’s drink or never taking drinks from strangers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel like the burden is being placed on the survivor once again, especially when the tips are things like, ‘Cover your drink, don’t take drinks from strangers,’ she explained to Ashlock. “We know these things. These things aren’t new to us. You are expecting people to control their own safety, in a sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlcok responded by stating that “one of the challenges of violence prevention education is coming at it from all these different angles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to have a clear message against violence in the community. There is not one proven method of violence prevention.

Trump from the Office of the President of the United States,” was authored by Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson and seconded by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas. It calls on the 70th Associated Students (A.S.) Senate to support the “impeachment and removal” of President Trump from office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, Senate meets weekly in the Flying A Studios Room of the University Center, but the decision was made Tuesday afternoon by Internal Vice President Alli Adam to move this week’s meeting to Corwin Pavilion as a matter of safety and space, to ensure that the Flying A Studios Room was not overcrowded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the meeting, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez said while there is “no way of knowing” the size of the crowd for Wednesday’s meeting, the Senate generally moves to a larger space when it is “a kind of topic that very likely people will want to comment on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Senate leaders expected a larger crowd due to the nature of the resolution’s topic, approximately 20 people were present for Wednesday’s meeting — a number which decreased to approximately five by the end of action items for the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have heard from many students that this resolution is important to them and that they support it,” Ferguson said in an email. “They have said that President Trump’s actions affect all of us, and they have emphasized the importance of holding our President accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a Senator, I have the duty of representing my constituents with diligence and intention. I feel that it is my duty to express my support for the impeachment of President Trump, as his actions affect my constituents lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also discusses the whistleblower within the Trump Administration who </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html?module=inline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came forward</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August with concerns about a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower accused Trump of pressuring Zelensky to gather damaging information on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls Trump’s alleged actions “illegal” and writes that it is “Congress’s duty to impeach a President who commits high crimes and misdemeanors while in office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It sets a bad precedent to allow a sitting President to commit crimes while in office and get away with it when the President of the United States is expected to abide by all of the laws of the United States of America,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson emphasized in his email that he believes the Senate has a “moral responsibility” to pass the resolution and set a precedent for action on future national political decisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With a school as politically engaged as UCSB, I think there is an importance of taking stances on major political issues like this,” Ferguson said. “I do believe the majority of the student body would support passing this resolution.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the passage of the resolution, Ferguson believes Senate will continue passing more resolutions around national political issues in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think we will feel more comfortable in the future as a Senate with taking stances on major political issues.

Finding a place to live is hard,” he said. “I slept on campus because I was too scared to go outside and look for housing as someone who’s a foster and formerly incarcerated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprise resonated on the Regents’ faces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is horrifying to hear,” Regent Sherry Lansing said. “We should take action on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources such as the UC Santa Barbara Guardian Scholars Program (GSP) and Berkeley Underground Scholars exist throughout the UC system, offering academic and career advising as well as scholarships for foster and formerly incarcerated students, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a lack of funding and outreach have limited their effectiveness, Borges and Hoang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borges elaborated on UC Berkeley’s own version of GSP — Berkeley Hope Scholars (BHS) — as an example. While BHS does supply emergency housing to students when dorms are closed during holidays, relatively few people know that they can apply for a space, and so most are “kicked out” during winter break, according to Borges, who added that acceptance is limited and based on a lottery system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Borges said, students are forced into “the most inadequate” off-campus housing with mold, abusive or neglectful landlords and residents with little concern for their well-being. Securing more suitable arrangements would require parents to sign leases, money to pay deposits and a family tax history — but, as Hoang stated, “There’s no relying on mommy and daddy to get any of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a potential recourse, Borges said; passed years ago, California State Legislature bills </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB1393\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1393</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1228\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1228</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require the California Community Colleges and the California State University systems to give priority year-round housing to foster and homeless students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this requirement does not apply to the UC system until the Regents formally enact it into policy. And so far, according to Borges, they haven’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’m here to ask,” she continued regarding the bills, “is to maybe put it on your radar.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond housing, Hoang proposed other changes that would benefit the foster and formerly incarcerated student population after graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recommendations included awarding fellowships to alumni to compensate for the extra hands, resources and living space that parents would normally provide in an initial job search; hiring more foster and formerly incarcerated people as employees of the UC system, since they know best how to solve the problems that they themselves face every day; and re-evaluating the use of criminal background checks for certain jobs in the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoang said there is a combined, approximate total of 160 foster and formerly incarcerated students at UC Berkeley, based on the memberships of BHS and Berkeley Underground Scholars. However, he pointed out that, based on his research, the true count includes an “undetected number of about double that” — by including those who do not wish to make their history known due to the potential stigma in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For their part, the Regents appeared receptive to the presenters’ suggestions. “I think those are recommendations we should seriously consider if we are truly committed to opening the doors to students who are not what we think of as a traditional student in the UC, which is primarily becoming the majority of students in higher education now,” Regent Eloy Ortiz Oakley stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the recommendations “seemed to be no-brainers to me,” said Regent Christine Simmons, who volunteered to head a task force to decide on short- and long-term changes within the UC system while conferring with Borges, Hoang, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and other students interested in voicing their feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlighting the need for collaboration and communication to solve issues on a more fundamental level, Lansing advised broadening the task force. “It seems to me it shouldn’t just be us [implementing these recommendations] … I think it should be the community colleges, Cal State and obviously UC,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a crisis that we have to address.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

among the UC system, most of the centers are between 20 and 30 years old,” current RCSGD director Craig Leets, who is the center’s ninth director, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were many students, staff and volunteers and other students who all have made the center of what it is today, who have brought the center through 20 years,” Leets added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s always important to me, to honor and recognize like the people who came before us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center kicked off its 20th anniversary celebrations with an event on Tuesday evening, with Leets giving attendees a small history of the RCSGD. He started by describing how the center, then known as the Queer Resource Center, was first started by a group of student activists in 1999 after the death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The students] organized to convince Chancellor Yang, who was here then and is still here now, that we needed a specific resource center for LGBTQ students. At the time that MCC existed, as well as the Women’s Center. But there was no university-funded space for LGBTQ students,” Leets explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff members then began a video call with former students, staff and activists who had worked with the center in the past, all of whom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflected on the activism involved with the RCSGD to celebrate it.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabrina Kwist, dean of equity and inclusion at Los Medanos College, who was a key part of the activism behind the founding of the RCSGD, was on the call and spoke to attendees about the experience of creating the center.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kyle Richards, the director of the RCSGD from 2002 to 2007, the center was originally located on the third floor of the University Center (UCen), next to University and Community Housing Services — Leets said that this was why the kickoff was held in the UCen as opposed to the center’s current location on the third floor of the Student Resource Building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The center was on] the third floor next to the community housing office and it was a small lounge and an office with a desk and a little library and then some sofas and that was about it,” Richards said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was during my time here that we moved over … That was when the Student Resource Building was first built and we were one of the first tenants that moved into it when it was opened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also during Richards’ time as director that the center changed its name from the Queer Resource Center to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, citing concerns that “queer” was inapplicable to people who did not identify as such.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a concern that the word ‘queer’ may be off-putting to some people, or they may be scared or didn’t identify as queer. So we wanted a name that was more inclusive to people, that felt like a broader terminology that was more representative of the greater community,” Richards explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He joked that despite the center’s name change, “RCSGD” wasn’t quite the nice, quick acronym they had hoped for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Richards, during the center’s early days it only had a very small budget to work with, so the center would partner with other campus organizations such as the MultiCultural Center and the Women’s Center to bring in speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it was a queer-related theme, then we would co-sponsor it with them and add it to a programming calendar of events that we would distribute. We would cross list things; that’s how we kind of maximized what we did, by partnering with other campus offices. That was the main way,” Richards said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the kickoff isn’t all the center has planned for the 20th anniversary.

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall gave planning services company KTUA  — which provides analysis and improves landscapes and transportation systems — an opportunity to share its concepts for redesigned UCSB transport, which will be implemented in the coming years to accommodate several new campus buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite a call for student voices to be involved in the new design, only six UCSB students attended the town hall when “we would have liked two hundred,” Tom Bertulis, a senior transportation engineer with KTUA, lamented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member spoke out about the lack of student voices at the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You think that students have the time to come to a two-hour meeting? Students are very busy, and that’s why they can’t come. If you need them to answer these questions, maybe email them,” he half-jokingly told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertulis began his presentation, he touched upon UCSB’s recent platinum-level bike friendliness designation, noting that UCSB is one of eight colleges in the nation to receive it and emphasizing the campus’s “unique bike culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, there are almost 1,300 bike trips in a peak 15-minute period. I’ve never seen anything like this… there are definitely unique challenges this campus faces in regards to bikes. Even a freeway can’t handle that many cars in such a short period,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alissa Hummer, director of Campus Planning and Design, explained the campus expansion that the renovated transit plans are meant to address, which include the construction of a new lecture hall that will begin within the next one and a half years, with 540 new faculty residences and a new student housing project in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we need to not have people bike on the interior of campus and just put bike racks on the outside?” Hummer asked. “It’s something to consider. At this point, everything is on the table.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new lecture hall, which is being built to accommodate increased class sizes, will most likely divert bike traffic onto UCen Road, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students understand the constraints of building a new lecture hall, but they understandably have some trepidation. We haven’t yet tried to mix bikes and cars in the same transport lane, but it will only be for about a block,” Hummer said. “In addition, we will most likely need new bike paths coming into the western side of campus to accommodate the new housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence of campus biking is why second-year environmental science major Sophie Roberts, a member of the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, decided to attend the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to maintain the bike paths that we have, and even add new ones because there’s so much bike traffic here already that closing paths could be dangerous,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, I have a class in the Psych Building, and then 10 minutes later I have a class on the other side of campus, and it’s physically impossible for me to get there by walking, which is why it’s so important to me we keep the bike paths.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Samarin, a KTUA consultant, emphasized wanting to clear up misconceptions students might have about the remodelling and removal of various bike paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The university has proposed some things, which are at this point just proposals. We’re here today to listen to feedback and see how people feel,” Samarin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In regards to closing bike paths, that would be for paths that are underused. We might be able to repurpose those for shuttles. It’s not removing paths just to remove them, it would be to accommodate other mobility,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertulis also brought up the idea of autonomous campus shuttles known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles, which are futuristic-looking white shuttles that could hypothetically transport students to opposite ends of campus and provide an alternative mode of transport for students who have trouble walking across campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was speaking to someone who represents the disabled population on campus and currently we have Uber and Lyft reimbursement for students who need a shuttle type of service. But we’re looking at more regular type of shuttle that could come more regularly and serve a larger demographic, if there’s demand,” Samarin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making campus transportation more accessible for disabled individuals was a key point throughout the moderated conversation at the town hall. Currently, making sure handicapped individuals have the transport services they need is one of KTUA’s “number one priorities,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the town hall, Hummer ended her conversation with a question for students and staff alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really have to look at this bike system that was never formally designed but was put together piece by piece by piece. We need to look at how it’s circulating. Are the bones of this system good and just need some tweaking, or is it fundamentally broken and we need to retool it all together?”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
