The passing of Measure E last November to create a Community Services District (CSD) marked a substantial victory for proponents of self governance following a decades-long movement for better representation for I.V. residents, a development both candidates vowed to capitalize on if elected.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77106\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77106\" data-attachment-id=\"77106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/dsc_0921-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0921 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77106\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C900\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0921-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tatiana </em>Karme<em>-Scalisi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, second-year global studies major, is the Isla Vista Party candidate for EVPLA.</p>\n<p>Batsheva Stoll, second-year history of public policy major and off-campus senator, is the Campus United candidate for EVPLA.</p>\n<p>Delivering opening remarks first, Dumlao said he would work closely with the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) office to create policies to support survivors of sexual assault as well as create an active community center in I.V. to center the needs of marginalized students.</p>\n<p>Stoll said since her freshman year she has worked to cultivate a place for herself both in A.S. and in the county, and she would work to hold representatives accountable and make the concerns of students in I.V. heard by the county officials.</p>\n<p>During the forum the two candidates answered both questions prepared prior to the event by the A.S. Elections Board and those anonymously shared from the audience.</p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of the topics discussed in Wednesday’s EVPLA forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SAFETY: </b>Stoll said she is working to create a police collaborative board of law enforcement officers, community members and students who would meet to offer individuals the opportunity to voice their concerns to law enforcement in a formal setting so that issues are “transparent” and people can engage in open dialogues regarding them. Stoll added this board would allow the police to address community concerns directly in a manner that is open to the public. Dumlao said having more training for the police force in I.V. is a crucial part of how they interact with the community and the current trainings are insufficient. He added that C.A.R.E. training, LGBTQ training, a racial-sensitivity training and a religious safety training are all necessary to prepare them to engage with the diverse population in I.V. Dumlao also said he wants to create more of a culture of community policing because Isla Vistans are capable and willing to care for their community and “don’t need an extreme police force every time there is a huge event in Isla Vista” to keep the community safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FIRST PRIORITIES: </b>Stoll said her first priority upon taking office would be to assist students struggling with tenants’ rights by creating an online platform similar to Rate My Professor but with profiles on landlords. On this site, students could discuss in an open forum issues relating to maintenance and legalities. She said she also aims to establish a community court in I.V. at which students could address minor misdemeanors instead of having to go to downtown Santa Barbara to deal with common tickets like minor in possession and drunk in public. Dumlao said his first priority would be to create sexual assault policies that serve the needs of survivors in I.V. and reverse the trend of incidents going unreported by working with the C.A.R.E. office and CSD to “empower survivors to come out and tell their stories and gain support.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FAMILIES: </b>Stoll said the best thing to do to help the families living in I.V. is to support the CSD and all its efforts to bring them into the community because, as a representative of students, it’s not her position to support their needs directly. She said she would support the CSD board’s aims to create tenant mediation and translation services specifically designed for these families. Dumlao said the first step to helping I.V. families is to reach out to them to learn more about their needs, followed by further action to create a community culture that “revolves around safety and love.” He said he plans to foster this through mentorship programs and increased resources available to all community members, regardless if they are students, such as a food bank and C.A.R.E. offices.\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_77104\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77104\" data-attachment-id=\"77104\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/dsc_0081-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0081 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77104\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=700%2C467\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tatiana </em>Karme<em>-Scalisi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PARKING: </b>Dumlao suggested establishing a UCSB shuttle system that would employ student workers and decrease carbon emissions, as well as designating a location outside of I.V. to park cars during Deltopia weekend, free of charge. Stoll said while one of the eight powers of the CSD is to create a parking program, she hopes to address the problem of overcrowded streets in I.V. more immediately by creating parking spots on the streets and developing alternate forms of transportation for students to deter them from bringing cars to I.V.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>HATE CRIMES: </b>Stoll said the best way to address hate crimes is to host open dialogues to break down walls within the community and increase transparency among all communities. Dumlao said there is no way to ensure LGBTQ students don’t experience hate crimes and that verbal violence affects all communities and can lead to physical violence. He said addressing a hate crime incident immediately will increase transparency, and making resources known to victims is important to demonstrate that “we don’t stand for it and that we are willing to talk about it.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>NOISE ORDINANCE:</b> Dumlao said a 10 p.m. noise ordinance through the weekend would not be a good idea because students need time to relax. He also said that, for many communities that are race-based, loud music and dancing are part of social gatherings. He added that the ordinance could increase tension between students and law enforcement and that there should be an emphasis on increased cooperation between neighbors regarding noise. Stoll said the county’s decision over summer to vote on the 10 p.m. noise ordinance without consulting student opinions is evidence of a “systemic problem” that has existed for decades, in which the county decides on policies for I.V. while students have no voice. She said working with the CSD will ensure that students are consulted by representatives to create continuity on policies that affect I.V. residents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>COMMUNITY RESOURCES:</b> Stoll said she has discussed various projects with the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), including a website to profile landlords and also a mobile application that lists students’ rights as tenants. On the app, students could upload a part of their lease to have an open dialogue and learn how to deal with problems with their landlords. “This is the first time they have probably entered into any kind of legal contract as an adult, and it’s really difficult to understand the legalities. There’s a lot of loopholes. I think landlords take advantage of the fact that students don’t really know what they’re doing,” she said. Dumlao argued that many students don’t have the option to access resources like IVTU amid their studies and jobs, so IVTU staff should go door-to-door to reach those people who are “not privileged enough” to access them on their own time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES: </b>Dumlao said being able to reach out to people who are undocumented to communicate to them their rights, with translation services available, is key because many members of the undocumented community don’t have the time to access the resources available to them. “They’re really just surviving on a day-to-day basis. Our job is to make sure they can thrive wherever they are living,” he said. Stoll said she would support efforts to create a sanctuary county in Santa Barbara because members of the undocumented community should be allowed to live their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>POLICE BRUTALITY: </b>Stoll said the best means of addressing police brutality is to break down barriers between the community and law enforcement. She re-emphasized the importance of creating a police collaborative board. “We need to hold them accountable as people part of our community, but we owe them the benefit of the doubt as well … they are here to keep us safe at the end of the day,” she said. Dumlao again said one way to combat police mistreatment is to hold additional trainings for police officers. “The police do get paid to do their job, and we need to make sure we are giving them the resources to do their job as efficiently as they possibly can,” he said.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each of their closing remarks, both candidates emphasized their dedication to working alongside the CSD board to create a strong and safe community in I.V.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she plans to address each of the issues in the I.V. community one-by-one in the most thorough way possible and will draw on her experience as an off-campus senator and a member of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“Knowing our representatives [and] being a part of these community meetings, I feel that I will be the best person to represent student voices in our local government and in our county and make sure Isla Vista stays strong and stays safe and students are aware of their resources and representation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dumlao emphasized that it is extremely important to him to ensure that all I.V. residents are welcomed and safe in I.V. by making sure that the the CSD hears marginalized students’ voices.</p>\n<p>“There are many communities in Isla Vista that don’t feel welcome and don’t feel safe all the time,” Dumlao said. “We want to make sure that Isla Vista is a place that we all feel loved.”</p>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/","id":2386,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2385,2384,2383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: Off-Campus Senator Candidate Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.</p>\n<p>Taking part in the off-campus senator forum were five Isla Vista Party candidates — Brandon Mora, Sami Kaayal, Veronica Leeman, Alexandra Gessesse and Ilene Ochoa — and six Campus United candidates — Kristen Armellini, Adham Btaddini, Deepika Chandrashekar, Sophia Dycaico, Sam Cook and Dominick DiCesare.</p>\n<p>Campus United candidates for off-campus senator — Alison Sir, Adnan Mansur, Anthony Pimentel, Evan Quash and Dhishal Jayasinghe — participated in the forum with the collegiate senator candidates due to an Elections Board scheduling mishap.</p>\n<p>Candidates Carla Martinez, Siboney Arias, Mara Joy Abubo and Justin Deckard did not show for Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Each candidate was given one minute to introduce themselves and their party position. Steven Kwok, the forum moderator, posed two questions for candidate response, allotting one minute each. The candidates were allocated 30 seconds for final remarks.</p>\n<p>Kwok first asked the candidates how they would ensure that the LGBTQ community on campus feels safe and recognized. The second question addressed the role the university should play regarding Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Responses to the issues presented by these questions and overarching goals were identified by each candidate as summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ochoa, a third-year communication major, said she hoped for a greater presence for the LGBTQ community on campus. Regarding Deltopia, Ochoa said the successful community outreach done by UC Isla Vista (UCIV) this year was indicative of what the I.V. community should represent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Cook, a first-year political science major, said he understands the importance in providing a space for the LGBTQ community to share their voice. As vice president of Santa Catalina Hall Council, he said he has helped to created events for LGBTQ students in the hall. Cook said the UCIV program played a crucial role in Deltopia this year, and the university’s provision of the Warm Up concert was a great incentive as well, proving that “the University has truly come full circle on how they view Deltopia and it will only get better from here.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mora, a third-year political science and sociology double major, said he would like to see the expansion of non-gendered bathrooms on campus so the LGBTQ community can be more included on campus. Mora said the university should ensure that the police presence in Isla Vista stays true to the approachable demeanor they held this year, rather than the more hostile demeanor Mora said the police assumed in prior years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Gessesse, a first-year history of public policy and sociology double major, said she wants to expand the definition of safe spaces for the LGBTQ community on campus to include restrooms and bathrooms. Gessesse said she wants the university to work closely alongside the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) during Deltopia. According to Gessesse, “the university spent a lot of money on advertisements that could be geared towards partnership towards creating safety with I.V. CSD.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Btaddini, a second-year political science major, said he wants to “empower the students here that are making an effort to fight for the LGBTQ community and represent students on campus.” Regarding the university’s role during Deltopia, Btaddini said the university should foster the kind of culture that does not punish students on big events, but looks out for their safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dycaico, a second-year history of public policy major, said if elected, she plans to reach out to LGBTQ communities to ensure they are heard and represented. She said the role the university plays in holding alternative events during Deltopia is an effective safety measure, especially when coupled with the help of UCIV.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DiCesare, a third-year computer science major, said he plans to use his platform “to bring different groups and ideologies on this campus together so we can have a better environment for this campus no matter who you are or what you identify as.” DiCesare said he believes students, as members of the university and as a part of the Isla Vista community, should all take steps during Deltopia to ensure that students are safe in all instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leeman, a second-year mathematical science and German double major, said she wants to reach out to professors to ensure they are incorporating “inclusive language in their syllabi and lectures” for the LGBTQ community. Leeman said the university’s role during Deltopia should be more proactive and less reactive and focus on educating students about why it is in their best interest to protect Isla Vista.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Chandrashekar, a first-year communication major, said that if elected, she plans on making it a point to start a conversation with the LGBTQ community, go to their meetings and hear what their concerns are. She also said students should have a voice in regard to the university funding of precautionary advertisements against Deltopia and where that funding may be better spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Kaayal, a second-year biology major, said he hopes to promote as many safe spaces on campus for the LGBTQ community as possible. Concerning the university’s role during Deltopia, Kaayal said he hopes to promote the idea of community policing. He said he believes the university should increase the jurisdiction of CSOs instead of bringing police in from other areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Armellini, a second-year history of public policy major, said she wants to “amplify” the voices in the LGBTQ community and “make sure they’re heard and taken care of.” She said the University’s approach to Deltopia should involve providing students with education, events and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mansur, a third-year statistics major, said he wants to help students get jobs after graduation, and plans to make Career Services more accessible. He also wants to increase alumni connections with current students. If elected, he said he wants to help students know where their student fees are going.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Sir, a first-year political science major, said she wants to represent minority communities and increase visibility of student resources. If elected, Sir said she wants to expand the A.S. Food Bank to Isla Vista so students can have access to it when off campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Pimentel, a second-year political major, said he wants to help keep student fees affordable and facilitate student-run businesses. If elected, he said he wants to serve as the liaison between the student body and the university administration and use A.S. to empower students.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Quash, a first-year statistical science and black studies double major, said he wants to increase off-campus students’ representation. If elected, Quash said he plans to achieve his goals as a senator through maintaining an open dialogue between A.S. and the administration to address issues such as college affordability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jayasinghe, a second-year philosophy and global studies double major, said he wants to fix the biggest problems in Isla Vista including parking and work alongside the CSD.

Grey said the money would be used to add additional renovations like a shade structure and garage doors for outdoor use, a classroom space and upgrades to the kitchen, bathroom and lighting.</p>\n<p>The timing of the CDBG denial brought some concern to Isla Vistans following President Donald Trump’s America First budget proposal, which included slashing 13 percent of the Housing and Urban Development budget.</p>\n<p>Part of the budget cuts includes eliminating funding for the CDBG program. According to the federal Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) budget blueprint, the program “is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results.”</p>\n<p>Several Isla Vista projects have received funding from the CDBG program in past years. Jay Freeman, an I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board director, said some of the programs the CDBG has funded include the I.V. Youth Projects and the I.V. Sidewalk Improvement Project currently underway along Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“[CDBG] is designed in order to provide infrastructure and housing upgrades for dense, underprivileged and complicated communities,” he said. “Not having that program anymore is going to make it a major complication to how we allocate resources.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson made additional statements on Thursday regarding the proposed cuts during a press conference in Miami, the <em>Miami Herald </em>reported.</p>\n<p>“What you need to concentrate on is: The parts of these programs that are functioning well — and that are maintaining people — are going to be preserved,” Carson said. “There may be a different nomenclature. We may not call it the same thing … We are clearly going to maintain these programs that are going very well.”</p>\n<p>In response to Carson’s statement, Freeman said it is not clear what he means.</p>\n<p>“For all we know, that means that they intend to keep some tax cuts that’s in there,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>The proposed elimination of the CDBG also comes during a time of budget shortage in Santa Barbara County. The county is currently looking at approximately $40 million in cuts, said Cameron Schunk, district representative for First District County Supervisor Das Williams.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we try our best to balance the budget and a lot of that money comes from grant funding,” Schunk said. “I think the key thing for people to understand is that this all translates into real world services that you and I use every day. It’s very easy to feel disconnected until you go to access a county service, and they say, ‘We don’t provide that anymore.’”</p>\n<p>Throughout the week, the county will be conducting budget workshops to consider proposals for the 2017-18 spending plan. Schunk said the departments were asked to overcut, so the proposed budgets include approximately $8 million worth of extra funding.</p>\n<p>“What we wanted to do was cut heavily and then be able to restore things that we thought were very critical,” Schunk said. “So of course we were going to have to make huge cuts, and there’s going to be big losses, but the idea is that we could minimize that by cutting huge [and] then going, ‘Okay, which thing do we want to restore or expand upon?’”</p>\n<p>One of such requests came from General Services, which asked for an additional $18,000 of general funds to be allocated for the community center’s ongoing maintenance. Jonathan Abboud, who serves as director on the board of the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), said the money is necessary to preserve the center’s basic operations.</p>\n<p>“We’re sending a lot of people to the county budget hearing to speak up for Isla Vista,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of funding from the CDBG and proposed cuts to the county, I.V. stakeholders are still rooting for the community center’s success.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CDBG, the county also applied for the state’s Housing-Related Parks Program (HRP), offered to cities and counties with affordable housing programs. The grant could potentially bring in approximately $1.1 million to the I.V. community center project.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD director, who also plans on attending the county’s budget hearing on Wednesday in support of the community center, said people are excited about the HRP grant and believe it will revitalize the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to see that it come to fruition,” Brandt said. “But in addition to that, I also think it’ll be important that the county continues to support the community center project even in their tough budgetary times. It’s important that the Isla Vista community lets the county know this is one of our priorities.”</p>\n<p>Besides the HRP grant, Isla Vistans are seeking other ways to fund the center through independent fundraising efforts. Brandt, who also serves as the director on the IVCDC, said the organization is actively soliciting donations from the community.</p>\n<p>“[We’re] letting folks know that Isla Vista is a great place to invest your money,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Schunk, who is also involved in the fundraising campaign as IVCDC’s president, said the denial of the CDBG is “not the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>“But certainly, I hope it lights a fire under folks and makes them understand that funding is critical,” he said. “Without it, there will be no community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/","id":3824,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[3823,3822,3821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed 12 questions, created prior to the debate by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the rest of the highlights from Monday’s presidential debate:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>COMMUNITY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Asked to define “community,” Nemeh gave a simple answer: “Isla Vista.” Nemeh said the university, police and Santa Barbara County have not prioritized student needs in their decisions concerning Isla Vista, which he said he hopes to address as president. Le said community is “being a Gaucho,” and he added that he plans to increase career planning services and expand the alumni recruitment network.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>POLICE PRESENCE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they felt police presence made the campus safer, to which Nemeh responded, “No.” Nemeh said the campus needs to “reevaluate our relationship with police,” citing an incident in February where a female skateboarder was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcibly detained</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Arbor after she attempted to flee from receiving a ticket. Nemeh advocated instead for  what he called “community-based policing.” Le said Nemeh “highlighted the cons” of campus police presence, but he wanted to “highlight the pros.” He said the police departments have made progress in “demilitarizing” their officers, and he cited the “substantial decrease” in the number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrests at Deltopia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this year.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nemeh said the attribute that uniquely qualifies him for president is his “pre-existing understanding” of A.S., having worked with the student government for the past three years. Le said his qualifying attribute is his “leadership capabilities,” and as president he said he wants to implement a “bottom-up” approach. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When asked how he has been an advocate for marginalized communities, Le cited his lobbying experience. He said he wants to empower students of marginalized communities rather than the “top-down” approach of advocating for them In response to the same question, Nemeh cited his work toward implementing the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single Transferrable Vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which he said makes voting more “equitable” in A.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>STUDENT FEES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first audience question of the day asked the candidates what they will do to ensure fiscal responsibility in light of the fact that UCSB students pay the highest student fees in the UC. Le said he plans to start a program for students to run their own businesses, which he said will create an alternate revenue source for A.S. Nemeh said A.S. needs to prioritize on eliminating tuition rather than reducing student fees.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS + LOCAL:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they view the position of A.S. president only working on campus issues. Nemeh said the Isla Vista Party wants to work directly with the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) and alongside the student governments of other UC campuses. Le said the president needs to help be present in statewide affairs and in making sure that President Donald Trump does not “encroach on our campus.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The next audience question asked the candidates if they had ever worked with UCSB Undocumented Student Services. Nemeh said he has “not directly” worked with the program, but he hopes to pick a qualified undocumented students services coordinator to work in the Office of the A.S. President. Le cited his experience lobbying to make California a “sanctuary state” and working alongside state legislators to push such legislation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS CLIMATE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another audience question asked the candidate to give their thoughts on campus climate in regard to a recent visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ben-shapiro-packs-campbell-hall-for-controversial-lecture/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a cancelled visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-11/milo-yiannopoulos-visit-canceled-at-uc-santa-barbara/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milo Yiannopoulos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Le said he supports freedom of speech “so long that these speakers abide by university conduct and they do not incite harm.” Le also mentioned how he was once a registered Republican in high school and has since switched party affiliations. Nemeh said he does not tolerate “students coming out and attacking other students for their identities,” citing the violence that erupted from Yiannopoulos’s visit to Berkeley in February. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEADERSHIP:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked what is the most important quality of a leader, Le said a leader must be able to listen to the issues of students on campus. Doerr did not pose the same question to Nemeh.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SPECIAL PROJECTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr asked each candidate if they planned to undertake any special projects should either of them become president. Nemeh mentioned again the “$48 fix,” but he also said he wants to implement an open-source textbook library. Le cited again his work to eliminate student tuition through the state legislature.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEGACY:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about the legacy they would want to leave, Le answered that it is not about leaving a legacy but rather about setting up a foundation for future student leaders. “Coming in with the mindset that we have to do everything in one year is not practical and feasible,” he said. Nemeh said he would like to strengthen communication between A.S. and university administration so that everyone is not “trying to reinvent the wheel from the beginning.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>ANTI-SEMITISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last audience question of the day asked the candidates how they plan to address the anti-Semitism on campus that may result from the Israel-Palestine conflict. Le said the campus needs to facilitate “ a civil discourse between Muslim groups on campus and the Jewish organizations.” Nemeh disagreed with Le, saying the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a Muslim-Jewish conflict. “Students who have disagreements with each other on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have it because of political disagreements, not religious ones,” he said.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FREEDOM OF SPEECH:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates to give their stance on the abilities and rights of students to protest. Both candidates said it is a constitutionally protected right. Nemeh said he is a strong supporter of demonstration, which he said helps to produce “new forms of knowledge.” Le said students should be able to express themselves freely and the campus should not be censoring any viewpoints.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>PRIVILEGE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked “what does privilege mean to you,” Nemeh recalled being able to move safely back to the U.S. from Syria at the start of the Syrian Civil War. Le recalled being the son of a Vietnamese refugee and the first in his family to attend a university.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FUN FACT: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le also shared a “fun fact” that he was “born on the 4th of July.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each of their closing remarks, both candidates said again that they want to focus on reducing the costs of attending university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. Elections began 8 p.m. Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of Apr. 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/","id":2412,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2411,2410,2409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andy Doerr, manager of the A.S. Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed six questions, formed by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights of Monday’s IVP candidate forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When asked about the largest problem with A.S., Sandhu cited what she called the “inability” of new senators to become comfortable and accustomed to their new position. Silva, meanwhile, said A.S. should “step up on accountability by making the association more public” and increase transparency with the work on-campus senators participate in.</li>\n<li>Both candidates listed passion as an important quality to have as an IVP. “Those with passion can dedicate themselves to the job can do it well effectively and efficiently,” Sandhu said.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would preserve a civil environment in Senate, Silva said she would make the senators “feel validated” for their work. Sandhu said she would “empower” senators to serve their constituents.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would train new senators, Sandhu said she would “revamp” senator training in the summer and focus on building strong connections with Boards and Commissions. Silva said she wants outgoing senators to train incoming senators through “informative workshops.”</li>\n<li>In terms of the connections that each candidate had for both student leaders and administrators around campus, Silva cited her working relationships with administrative officials like Assistant Director for Government Affairs LaDonte King, Executive Director Marisela Marquez and her history with student groups like the Black Student Union. Sandhu emphasized on the importance of maintaining these relationships and said she was “fortunate to have connected with different students on campus.”</li>\n<li>An audience member asked the candidates how familiar they are with the internal workings of an organization. Sandhu said she was the class president through fifth grade and high school and served as a senator this year. Silva said she has been “privileged” to have mentors within the association and understands the different perspectives of members of the association through their work on the budget.</li>\n<li>In her closing remarks, Silva said she is grateful for the opportunity to run for office and for those who have supported her. Sandhu said she loves UCSB and wants all students to have a positive experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S.

The first question pertained to the use of hate speech on campus, while the second one asked the candidates how they plan to work with the administration to achieve their goals as senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds for opening and closing remarks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates explained to audience members their plans for improving the lives of UCSB students. Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar, a third-year anthropology major, said she wants to “pioneer” a transfer commission and help marginalized students feel more represented on campus. She said she believes that while there is a constitutional right to free speech, the university should “not entertain” hate speech and help maintain an environment free from violence.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh, a third-year biology major, said he wants to improve CLAS access for transfer students and expand transfer orientation, two issues he wants to work on with the university administrators. He said it is an “amazing time” to be a transfer student, and he wants to focus his efforts on increasing support for them. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey, a second-year global studies and geography double major, said he wants to use his “passion for academics” and “ability to strive as a leader” to serve his community. According to Carey, hate speech should not be tolerated on campus, and he hopes he can “use existing channels” of communication with campus administrators to achieve his goals as a senator.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a third-year political science major, said she wants students to know how A.S. can affect change on campus. She also said she wants to “streamline” the dialogue between A.S. and university administrators and work to decrease tuition and increase class enrollment availability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel, a second-year political science major, said she wants to ensure that student fees are seen through student resources. Kopel said she believes hate speech can make some students “feel alienated” on campus and wants to help facilitate productive dialogue between differing groups. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banicki, a first-year biology major, said he wants to create more outdoor study spaces and hammocks on campus. He also said he wants to emphasize mental health and extend resources to students who may feel overwhelmed. As the president of the Santa Catalina South Residence Hall, he said he already “has a foot in the door” to work with university administrators. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez, a second-year sociology and economics double major, said she wants to increase representation of minority groups on campus. If elected, she said, she hopes to make college life more affordable and accessible to students.      </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uemura, a first-year chemistry major, said she wants to implement a mental health counselor for CCS and ensure an open dialogue with campus administrators. She said she believes there is a “fine line” between hate speech and free speech and said she hopes to maintain CCS as a “very safe space” that is welcome to everyone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almas, a second-year chemical engineering major, said he wants to work on making college more affordable for students, citing the high costs of tutoring and textbooks. He said he wants to create an open dialogue with administrators to ensure that the College of Engineering can be a safe and affordable environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond, a second-year electrical engineering major, said he is excited about the future of A.S. and wants to increase students’ awareness about the university’s “incredible” resources including UCIV and the Community Housing Office. He said he believes engineers are underrepresented and wants to increase mental health resources for them. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressman Salud Carbajal spoke at UCSB on Monday about the difficulty of passing Democratic legislation in a Republican-majority Congress. <em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Carbajal expressed hesitant hope for progressive legislation under the Trump administration but attempted to ensure the town hall attendees that he would do what he could despite being a Democrat in a Republican-majority congress.</p>\n<p>The congressman has sponsored or co-sponsored over 60 bills since being elected to Congress in November and said 25 of the bills have been bipartisan.</p>\n<p>“I still believe there’s always room for collaboration,” he said, despite the currently divided political climate.</p>\n<p>The town hall, hosted by the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, was divided into three sections of discussion: the environment, education and immigration. Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Of course we’re going to protest,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara 1969 oil leak spilled an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, it was the worst oil spill in the nation’s history until 20 years later, when the Exxon Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil off the coast of Alaska.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio oil spill of 2015 that spilled 80,000 gallons of crude oil, state and federal legislators enacted new laws, and Santa Barbara County worked alongside local environmental organizations to draft a plan of action in the event of a future pipe leak, as the <i>Nexus</i> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite such efforts, Zinke proposed on March 6 a region-wide, 73-million-acre lease sale offshore of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development.</p>\n<p>This lease sale will go into effect Aug. 16, 2017, which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said will grant leases to the highest bidder for exploration.</p>\n<p>Davis said the SBSC put out a petition asking Zinke to not open up new offshore leases in the Santa Barbara County in hopes of preventing future pipe leaks. She said the petition has over 17,000 signatures.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to deliver it and that he gets the message that if they are going to open up [leases], there is going to be a real push back and a lot of opposition,” Davis said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77064\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77064\" data-attachment-id=\"77064\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/environmentalists-protest-arctic-oil-drilling-naysayers-wine-about-it/fullsizerender-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77064\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local environmental groups spoke out against plans to expand offshore oil drilling amidst a visit by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to Santa Barbara on Monday. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Of the 470 leases issued in the Pacific Ocean, 43 are active.

Suck Black D*ck Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Racist,” was part of the 18 total Pride Week events throughout Apr. 10-18. Johari Hunt, the event host and a first-year chemistry major, discussed queer history, racism, sexualization of black bodies and the intersection of people of color, social media and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event began with a discussion about queer history and what the minority community within the LGBTQ community looked like throughout the 1900s, specifically “drag ball culture” and the houses in New York that acted as safe spaces and cultural havens for the LGBTQ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt went on to define racism, prejudice and how the “system of advantage based on race” allows society to understand various forms of oppression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Racism isn’t defined by someone saying the n-word, but its systematic and institutional,” he said in an interview. “It is whenever a black person says they’re afraid of police. It is being seen as a criminal before you’re even seen as a child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Racism] is … a system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals,” Hunt added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting racism and prejudice to the perceptions and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity within the LGBTQ community led to an engaged discussion at the event about the intersections of social media, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt’s final segment focused on HIV/AIDS history and the fact that HIV and AIDS transmission within the black community has been neglected in conversations about sex. This has led to a lack of visibility about the topic, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During audience discussion, audience members pointed out the history of United States Vice President Mike Pence and the LGBT community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an archived version of </span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http:/cybertext.net/pence/issues.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Vice President Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign addressed the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for </span><a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website stated that reauthorization of the act should be completed only after an audit to ensure that federal funding would not be given to organizations that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also stated that funding and resources “should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the World Health Organization, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and about 35 million people have died of HIV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, 1.1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76975\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76975\"

experiences, like being black and gay or living with HIV, that are not in a research paper or in an article, need to be talked about,” Hunt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said the hardest part of organizing the event was putting something so blatant into context. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he wanted the audience to start a conversation about what it means to be a minority group in the LGBT community and learn about different life experiences within the LGBT community that most people do not realize exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the process of creating the event, Hunt said he thought about issues that gay men face “all the time” and found that masculinity, and what it means to be masculine, is a critical concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then it went to being black as perceived,” Hunt said. “And then I reached the actual sexualization of black bodies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he felt the event presented his central points openly enough to promote and discuss as well as establish future conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wanted his audience to leave “not with answers, but with the willingness to look for them.”</span></p><div

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday renaming A.S. Publications after David Miller, an A.S. print shop employee of five years who passed away last month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was passed to “commemorate his life and honor his service to the student body” by renaming the shop “David Miller A.S. Publications.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Publications is a partially subsidized low-cost printing business available to UC Santa Barbara students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller worked as assistant publications coordinator, organizing and designing course readers with professors, and helping students and professors design flyers and posters for campus organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by Ashley Selki, an off-campus senator and third-year economics major, and was seconded by Batsheva Stoll, an off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion praises Miller and says he “was a good man with a wonderful work ethic who was dedicated to supporting student endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she decided to author the resolution in order for people struggling in “these difficult times” to have a tangible way to honor his memory and for future students to appreciate the impact that his work had on helping students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she hopes students in the future who will never have been able to meet him will take the name of the print shop as a dedication to his hard work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a wonderful man David Miller was and how much we appreciate everything that he’s done for the association. He will be deeply missed,” Selki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Publications can be found in UCen Room 1531 near the A.S. Ticket Office and the MultiCultural Center.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/senate-passes-resolution-to-rename-a-s-publications-in-memory-of-employee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/senate-passes-resolution-to-rename-a-s-publications-in-memory-of-employee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/senate-passes-resolution-to-rename-a-s-publications-in-memory-of-employee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/senate-passes-resolution-to-rename-a-s-publications-in-memory-of-employee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/senate-passes-resolution-to-rename-a-s-publications-in-memory-of-employee/","id":2404,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2403,2402,2401],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bill To Allow Priority Registration for ROTC Cadets","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of the bill began approximately seven years ago when the Internal Vice President of the Senate at the time was an ROTC cadet who wanted to resolve the registration concerns of other ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current A.S. President Austin Hechler, however, has been the first to take action since its original proposal, and Senators Alex Giolito and Riley Hobson have authored the most recent version.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giolito credited Hechler for the work he has done to revive the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent history, what brought this all together was Austin Hechler and his work with the ROTC program through talking with a number of different members of it whom he worked with for this project,” Giolito said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Hechler’s outreach to ROTC, Giolito and Hobson began to draft the bill. The bill outlines problems that have existed for UCSB students in the ROTC program, such as the challenge of attending morning classes after morning workouts, managing major classes and keeping up with ROTC requirements while balancing their schedules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bill has garnered support from a variety of individuals, including both current and former UCSB ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill includes a letter from current ROTC Cadet Austin Amato, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, to the Academic Senate. In the letter, Amato said he supports the potential results that priority registration could bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I had the opportunity to utilize priority registration, I would have been more competitive in ROTC, better prepared for classes and perhaps had the opportunity to further immerse myself into other activities and clubs around campus, such as the TMP [Technology Management Program] program,” he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, the interim co-dean of undergraduate education for the College of Letters &amp; Science, said he also supports this bill. He said that with prior registration, those enrolled in the ROTC program would have fewer quarters of academic advising since they will be able to better follow their pre-approved academic schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This will benefit the ROTC cadets, and by reducing workload in our understaffed office, indirectly benefit all Letters &amp; Science students,” Stopple said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Senate’s approval, the bill will now be evaluated by the Academic Senate. If it passes there, it will then go into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ROTC students are a respected portion of the student body and should certainly be rewarded by our school for their dedication and service to the ROTC program,” Hobson said. “I can’t think of any better way to do this than by making their schedules easier by allowing ROTC students to pick their classes with priority.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print
