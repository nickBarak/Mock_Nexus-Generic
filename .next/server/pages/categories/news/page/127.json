According to a statement released by the SB County Sheriff’s Office, all seven businesses are subject to a fine of up to $3,000 each. Minor decoy programs involve ABC- and Sheriff-contracted individuals under the age of 21 attempting to purchase alcohol from businesses with liquor licenses.</p>\n<p>Some businesses did not check identification, while others checked identification and still sold alcohol to customers despite minor status, according to officials with the Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>The SB County Sheriff’s Office recently received a $50,000 grant from ABC to address the high percentage of alcohol related crimes in the I.V. and Goleta area. According to the statement, the grant is used only for overtime investigations and will not interfere with everyday law enforce operations.</p>\n<p>According to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the investigations aim to reduce youth access to alcohol in areas where alcohol-related crimes are highest, and to ensure that businesses with licenses to sell alcohol enforce the minimum purchase age.</p>\n<p>The press release stated minor decoy operations conducted in I.V. last year found zero citations with all businesses in compliance with the alcoholic minimum age limit.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/sheriffs-dept-abc-cite-seven-i-v-business-for-selling-alcohol-to-minors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/sheriffs-dept-abc-cite-seven-i-v-business-for-selling-alcohol-to-minors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/sheriffs-dept-abc-cite-seven-i-v-business-for-selling-alcohol-to-minors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/sheriffs-dept-abc-cite-seven-i-v-business-for-selling-alcohol-to-minors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/sheriffs-dept-abc-cite-seven-i-v-business-for-selling-alcohol-to-minors/","id":3776,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3775,3774,3773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter Feb. 9-17","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.</p>\n<p>On Monday, law enforcement confronted a female SBCC student outside I.V. Market after she stole a bottle of tequila. Deputies arrested the suspect for theft and minor in possession. Later on Monday, deputies responded to reported gunshots at Ocean Meadows golf course. I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and Goleta Sheriff’s units responded and established a perimeter around the course and an air unit was deployed. Further investigation of the incident determined reports to be unfounded.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, IVFP units responded to an anonymous call about animal mistreatment taking place in I.V. Authorities identified and requested to search April Stewart’s vehicle to check the welfare of her dogs and found she was in possession of a used hypodermic needle and a glass pipe commonly used to smoke methamphetamine. According to the IVFP, residue left in the pipe indicated recent use. Stewart’s animals were also found to be not properly cared for and Stewart was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, violation of probation and cruelty to animals.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies subdued a man refusing to pay a cab driver on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect, later identified as Darris Cotton, was seen evading the cab driver and attempting to flee. Deputies were able to contact Cotton, who the cab driver wanted to have arrested for petty theft for failure to pay. After deputies conducted a records check on Cotton, it was discovered he was on parole for robbery and was subsequently arrested for violation of parole.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP stopped SBCC student Jose De Alba, who was walking down the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde carrying a laptop. When confronted, De Alba’s story contained conflicting evidence and upon further investigation deputies found the had just committed a residential burglary, though officials declined to state where the burglary occurred. The laptop was returned and De Alba was arrested.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, a male subject was reported to be “prowling,” lurking in an area intending to commit a crime, in a backyard on the 6700 block of Pasado. The property resident was able to provide a detailed description of the suspect who was later identified and arrested in an in-field lineup.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP recorded nine arrests and 12 citations. On the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, a male subject was observed walking in a small group being extremely loud. The subject was trying to high five passersbys and was determined to be causing a disturbance with the potential to cause a fight. The male and his friends began to flee once they saw law enforcement approaching. Subjects fled for about two blocks but were apprehended at International Food Market. The original male was located in the back parking lot of the store, out of breath and urinating on himself. He was charged for public intoxication, fleeing law enforcement and urinating in public.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, deputies recorded three arrests and six citations. On Sunday night, Pizza My Heart employees reported a female who had been at the restaurant drinking all day. She left and returned later, more intoxicated than she had been when she left. She was socializing with restaurant patrons and then began to pass out on a table. Alone and unable to care for her own safety, she was arrested for public intoxication. Later, Garden Court Security reported an intoxicated male in the courtyard area causing a disturbance. He fled the complex, but was located at 880 Camino del Sur and arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Finally, at approximately 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday the 17th, deputies responded to a call of a subject who appeared to be injured within a vehicle in the parking lot of Goleta Beach.  Upon arrival, it was discovered that the male victim was killed by an apparent gunshot wound.  The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is investigating, but law enforcement reports that at this point no foul play is suspected.   No further information will be released until the victim’s next-of-kin has been notified.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-60876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Omar Jishi, MSA member and fourth-year electrical engineering major who attended the vigil, said the shooting is a manifestation of recent Islamophobic sentiments in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“This comes at a time when Islamophobia had become all too clear in the way conversations are held and how the media reports the news,” Jishi said.</p>\n<p>According to Jishi, the incident highlights discriminatory treatment of Muslims purported by some mass media outlets.</p>\n<p>“A Muslim-American Human Rights lawyer was asked on CNN whether he supported ISIS,” Jishi said. “This creates an atmosphere where hatred towards Muslims can become prevalent for no other reason than the God they worship or the attire they choose.”</p>\n<p>Jishi also said the MSA views the three students “as our brothers and sisters in faith,” and that the candlelight vigil aimed to bring attention to the Islamophobic sentiment that pervades even college campuses.</p>\n<p>Whitney Triplett, a third-year psychology major who attended the event, said the vigil helped create a space in which students could be informed about what happened in Chapel Hill as well as be supportive of the victim’s families.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for these types of stories to get out and be made public,” Triplett said. “It’s important to come out and make a statement and let these peoples’ families know that even from here in California we mourn with them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said students living in Isla Vista last Spring can relate the incident at Chapel Hill.</p>\n<p>“Here at UCSB we know what it’s like to lose students,” Sallak said.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman from Santa Barbara Hillel was present at the vigil and said he attended in order to mourn with a fellow religious community on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m very sensitive to both the trauma of these kind of horrible murders at a college campus,” Goodman said. “Especially when it involves a religious community.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, solidarity among religious communities is especially vital in the midst of instances of hate crime.</p>\n<p>“If there was even a hint of this being a bias or hate crime then we need to stand together,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_60874\" style=\"width: 610px\"

The economics department has not yet decided specific areas for allocating the $5 million.</p>\n<p>Economics Department manager Kenneth Freeland said the donations from Aster have been cumulatively given to the university through his estate, and the main gift came this past December and consisted of $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>“This is coming through in all sort of varying amounts over time,” Freeland said. “They range from about 100k to around 4 million, so we have gotten several distributions and are expecting more. We got one over Christmas break, which is money we didn’t even know about that came in at about 1.3 million.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, the money will go to an Endowed Chair, to be called the Aster Chair to honor Richard Aster.<br>\n“We can hire a very senior, you know, kind of high level, renowned economist to have an Endowed Chair here with the money,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the Economics Department Kelly Bedard said donor money affects the campus as a whole and not simply the economics department.</p>\n<p>“Donor money is used in a variety of ways on campus broadly — it is not unique to economics — to do a variety of things,” Bedard said. “One thing is to have what are called endowed chairs to attract nationally known scholars and hiring people doing important work in whatever area that we happen to be talking about that is beneficial to the campus and the students.”</p>\n<p>Bedard also said department faculty will decide where the money goes.</p>\n<p>“We give a lot of thought to how it gets allocated and where we think it would have the benefits and so on,” Bedard said. “And of course it is also in consultation with the Dean of Social Science and the Administrators in Cheadle Hall and so on.”</p>\n<p>According to Bedard, economics is among the largest majors at the university and new funds are always welcome.<br>\n“We are certainly one of the biggest if not the biggest,” Bedard said. “I think most years we are the biggest, but you know things do fluctuate.”</p>\n<p>Economics department Academic Personnel Specialist Anne Ellis said the money can be used to host talks for students, and right now they have three lecture series: the Philip Babcock Lecture Fund, the Herb Kay Lecture and the Carl Snyder Memorial Lecture.</p>\n<p>“They all have a different emphasis, so the Babcock one has more of an undergraduate emphasis, so there is a couple undergraduates students who get to choose the speakers so it is more geared towards the undergraduates,” Ellis said. “Herb Kay is more of a business related one, it’s usually a prominent business person, it is not necessary a professor or something, they have a business, and Snyder is usually a very high level economist, so someone famous in the economist world.”</p>\n<p>Freeland said the Graduate Student Administration will be able to make improvements to the facilities and give more financial support to the current 107 graduate students.</p>\n<p>“Some of our offices are going to get new paint and new carpet — so the Administrative Offices, so the facilities — because the university doesn’t have a lot of money to really make fancy facilities,” Freeland said. “Some of the money is going to go to graduate student support, so we are going to spin off some money that we can use to offer to Ph.D. students and to provide financial support for grad students.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, it is because of donors such as Aster that undergraduates have a career center that is unlike those of most campuses.</p>\n<p>“We have an undergraduate career center, which is unusually unique for campuses. Some schools have new graduate career centers — we actually have an undergraduate career center which focuses on our accounting students because even though we are not a business school, the degree is a professional degree and a lot of our students actually have permanent job offers by the end of their junior year,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>A series of lectures will be funded by Aster’s donations towards public lectures for speakers, students, faculty and staff that are free and open to people in the community.</p>\n<p>“The department is doing more public lectures and inviting people in who are business leaders, from alumni who have been very successful and also Nobel Laureates and people who are very famous economists,” Freeland said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/econ-dept-to-create-endowed-chair-with-alumnus-donations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/econ-dept-to-create-endowed-chair-with-alumnus-donations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/econ-dept-to-create-endowed-chair-with-alumnus-donations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/econ-dept-to-create-endowed-chair-with-alumnus-donations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/econ-dept-to-create-endowed-chair-with-alumnus-donations/","id":2899,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2898,2897,2896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Farr Talks About LAFCO, I.V.

Self-Governance Bill AB 3 was written by Assemblyman Das Williams and proposes to make I.V. a community services district (CSD), which would allow I.V. to levy taxes in order to provide services such as additional lighting, parking, community maintenance and advocacy through elected board members. LAFCO has drafted a letter of concern over the bill, requiring it to pass through their jurisdiction before progressing into the state legislature.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the initial opposition to the bill stemmed from LAFCO members’ concern over not being involved and informed about the process.</p>\n<p>“I think that LAFCO members are concerned because normally when we talk about making a community services district, it would go through LAFCO, not the state legislature,” Farr said. “That’s why a special meeting has been called to decide whether to send a letter or not.”</p>\n<p>Farr said sending the bill to state legislature does not necessarily exclude LAFCO from being involved with the creation of a CSD and that after the bill is drafted in its entirety there will be a chance to determine whether LAFCO will approve it or not.</p>\n<p>“Because we don’t know what the final bill language is, it’s entirely possible LAFCO will be involved,” Farr said. “Actually when the legislature passed a similar bill to create a college district for Isla Vista 30–40 years ago, they did part of and it gave it to LAFCO to draft another part.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO’s involvement is vital in order to ensure the bill can last in the state legislature.</p>\n<p>“They have hearings here in the community: it’s easier to go than to go up to Sacramento to testify for something,” said Farr.</p>\n<p>Farr said if the city wants to change the boundaries of a district, they have to go through LAFCO, and defining a specific district for the CSD requires LAFCO’s jurisdiction. Applying for a change in boundaries or districts involves a process during which proponents must obtain a certain amount of community support via petition form, pay an application fee and submit payment for fiscal analysis. According to Farr, this process is difficult to carry out in I.V. because of the temporary nature of the residents.</p>\n<p>“In a community like IV it’s very challenging to go through this process because [the process] is designed for permanent long term residents,” Farr said. “That’s part of why something like this hasn’t happened before by being generated from within the community.”</p>\n<p>In regard to finding a solution to what Farr described as a lack of permanent resident responsibility in I.V., Farr said there has been some discussion regarding changing boundaries to include university-owned housing and involve more students and staff in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>“Who would decide that is the question right now, would it be the chancellor or the county, it would work to bring the community more longevity and stability,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, LAFCO will be able to take a position on the matter when the language of the AB 3 is finalized. Farr also said it is difficult to detail specific aspects of the CSD, such as policing powers.</p>\n<p>“The CSD could have policing powers but law enforcement services are extremely expensive,” Farr said, “We would have to find more money as opposed to letting the county continue to foot that bill.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a facet of the community the CSD might be able to address is referred to as the “broken window effect,” which is when a community starts to look bad or degrade and then becomes more attractive for individuals to continue to destroy as opposed to maintain.</p>\n<p>“It kind of comes back to the built environment and having housing that’s attractive that makes students want to stay in the community after they graduate, creating a group of less temporary residents in Isla Vista,” Farr said.<br>\nAccording to Farr, I.V. requires a newly modeled CSD to address issues of public safety in the neighborhood due to its uniqueness, and there has always been student interest in the matter.</p>\n<p>“We need to address a model that is different than what we’ve done before. That’s what the committee member is working on right now,” Farr said. “There’s always been a lot of student interest from the very beginning, and ever since I’ve been in office there hasn’t been a six month period gone by when a student hasn’t brought up CSD and LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a special meeting will be held one week from today to discuss a new draft for AB 3, and despite the fate of the letter, LAFCO and the State legislature will continue tracking the bill and making suggestions.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a new issue though. What’s happened is that incidents that occurred last spring really galvanized the community, university and trustees,” Farr said. “AB 3 came out of the trustees’ report and this was their ultimate recommendation. It is definitely time once again to explore what options are out there and make some changes,” Farr said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60868\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60868\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/","id":4768,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4767,4766,4765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Board of Supervisors, Sheriff’s Dept.

According to the current Facebook event, Deltopia 2015 is scheduled for Saturday April 4.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said supervisors at Tuesday’s meeting in Santa Maria granted the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department’s request to help keep everyone safe during the unsponsored event.</p>\n<p>“The changes were made at the request of the Sheriff’s department in order to assist them in managing the crowds at a Deltopia event, similar to what is already in place for the Halloween event,” Farr said. “Both Halloween and Deltopia are unsponsored events. This means no one wants to take responsibility or be liable for what happens at these events.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, supervisors felt the need to create the noise ordinances so that law enforcement could better prevent Deltopia from erupting in disorder again.</p>\n<p>“The County’s main job is to protect the public’s health and safety and the Sheriff’s department felt that this would be an important tool to assist them in doing that during Deltopia,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr and other members on the Board of Supervisors created the noise ordinances by amending Chapter 6 Article VI of Santa Barbara County Code, which governs “outdoor festivals.” According to the code, an outdoor festival is defined as “any musical festival, dance festival, ‘rock’ festival or similar music activity”. Any person violating this code by staging an “outdoor festival” between 6 p.m. of such date and 7 a.m. of the following date will be subject to a citation. Farr said the noise ordinances will be in effect April 3–5 and 10–12.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 6,036 individuals on Facebook had identified themselves as “going” to the Deltopia 2015 event. Deltopia 2014 attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemical engineering major Erich Brodbeck, who has lived on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive for two years, proposed a checkpoint system to curb out-of-towners from entering I.V. Brodbeck pointed out that a majority of those arrested last year were out-of-towners and insisted that they are not invited this year.</p>\n<p>“Ideally the police department should set up checkpoints around Isla Vista on the week leading up to Deltopia and on Deltopia weekend requiring people show proof of residence or some other form of identification,” Brodbeck said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Sergeant Rob Romero said law enforcement is determined to maintain a safe environment should Deltopia take place.</p>\n<p>“We will be bringing in additional UCPD support and will be implementing safety procedures similar to what students experienced during Halloween,” Romero said in an email. “Our role is to address issues of student and community safety and help create a safe environment. We will be working closely with the Sheriff’s Department towards this goal.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">According to Brodbeck, because Deltopia is scheduled online without restrictions, stronger steps should be taken to keep too many people from attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“Since the event is openly shared on Facebook and can reach many individuals, more drastic measures need to be taken in case these out-of-towners do show up expecting to party in our community,” said </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Brodbeck</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">. “How our community handles Deltopia this year will speak volumes to all the eyes that are on us.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Yang stating: “Since the event is openly shared on Facebook and can reach many individuals, more drastic measures need to be taken in case these out-of-towners do show up expecting to party in our community…How our community handles Deltopia this year will speak volumes to all the eyes that are on us.” This statement was actually provided by Erich Brodbeck.

id=\"caption-attachment-60704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A recent proposal from the Financial Aid Office considers lowering the amount of financial aid that students who have waived Gaucho Health Insurance receive.</p></div>\n<p>The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed plan, students receiving financial aid who waive GHI will receive less money than those who keep university student health insurance and will instead receive aid based on a student survey-based “industry average” determined by the university. UCSB has the most expensive health insurance plan in the UC system at around $2,568 per year ($856 per quarter) for the next academic year, and up to 50 percent of students waive this plan every school year.</p>\n<p>GHI Advisory Committee Budget Officer Mike Anderson said the plan exists to better allocate financial aid resources to students in need.</p>\n<p>“If a student already has insurance then the financial aid office will take that money and give it to others who are financially struggling,” Anderson said. “They need the GHI Plan and can increase their financial aid package. I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy, the Financial Aid Board wrongly assumes students receiving financial aid do not need the money given for health insurance.</p>\n<p>“If you remove the funding for health insurance because you waived the Gaucho Health Insurance does not mean you have the money for health insurance. You may still need that money to pay for the other health insurance,” Guthy said. “Students who waive out of health insurance are not incurring that cost for health insurance or have a family plan.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised. —Andrew Okeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. is currently working with the Financial Aid Office to reach an agreement to avoid cutting the financial aid benefits for student health insurance.</p>\n<p>First-year computer science major Andrew Okeh said he believes the plan does not benefit students and instead profits the university.</p>\n<p>“Since when are less benefits ever good?” Okeh said. “The people who are involved with the board, it’s good for them because providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Navpreet Khabra said she also opposes the proposal because she believes that the aid students receive specifically allocated to health insurance is valuable to students who opt out of GHI.</p>\n<p>“By lowering their financial aid award, it could offset the money that they would have saved,” Khabra said. “I personally was able to use the money saved from waiving GHI for other educational expenses such as textbooks and transportation.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, however, if students waive GHI it implies they have more affordable health insurance plans.</p>\n<p>“If people waive out then they have other health insurance, it’s already in the family budget and calculated for,” Anderson said. “Because they have health insurance, they’ll waive out. There’s a large percentage of students who don’t have health insurance like students overseas. It’s something we’re exploring. It may or may not happen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60837\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60837\" data-attachment-id=\"60837\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/ghi/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=1384%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1384,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"GHI\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=888%2C299&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60837\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI-1024x345.jpg?resize=600%2C202\" alt=\"Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=1024%2C345&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?w=1384&amp;ssl=1 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Guthy, she and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau have reached a compromise with the Financial Aid Board that would allow students to possibly alter their financial aid award under certain financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say the industry average is $1,500 and if you pay more than that, you could go to the financial aid office to adjust that,” Guthy said. “We reached a verbal agreement on our meeting on Friday so I’m pretty sure that’s what we’re doing.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the plan will be ultimately beneficial because it will help students who are financially struggling by expanding the available limits on general financial aid funding.</p>\n<p>“Financial aid offices run out of money. They give out grants and scholarships and then are left with loans. They could give those grants to those who are having a tougher time and I think that would be a good thing,” Anderson said. “I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Paige Donaldson however said the plan is “terrible” because it does not help students save money.</p>\n<p>“I waived the health insurance because I couldn’t afford it, so how would cutting my financial aid do any good?” Donaldson said. “Either way it’s a trap to make us pay more and make money off of us, but students are not to be treated like walking money bags to make a profit.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.<strong> —</strong>Willie Roman</p></blockquote>\n<p>Willie Roman, a first-year English and economics double major said he’s surprised the plan is even being considered.</p>\n<p>“Personally, as a student from a low income household, my financial aid is absolutely critical, and stretched thin as it is,” Roman said. “Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy however, the Financial Aid Board has been open to working with the student body to enact reasonable financial aid policy and are hoping students participate in the upcoming surveys.</p>\n<p>“Financial Aid Office is sending out a survey to gauge the industry average and collect more data. They won’t erase the funding entirely but will lessen it to the industry average,” Guthy said. “We encourage people to do the survey to give students time to prepare for this change. I think we’ve reached a good conclusion.”</p>\n<p>Anderson, said a decision regarding the proposal, whose rising costs are due to the Affordable Health Care Act, will be made in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to wrap it up here in the next few weeks,” Anderson said. “There used to be caps on the benefits of each person. It’s getting expensive because the Affordable Health Care act put no caps on the benefits.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/","id":2922,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2921,2920,2919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU To Picket Apartment Evictions","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Tenant Union (IVTU) plans to lead a picket on Friday at 12 p.m. beginning at the Pardall Center as part of their “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” campaign protesting the eviction of ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60777\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60777\" data-attachment-id=\"60777\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422625852\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60777\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-41-1024x682.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Earlier this month, I.V.

The evicted tenants have filed small claims lawsuits.</p>\n<p>IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov said the aim of the march is to educate the community on the ongoing issue of mass evictions in I.V. and call on Majestic Asset Management, Inc. to grant the evicted tenants relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>“We would like to see the tenants as a united force, fighting for better housing in Isla Vista,” Bogdanov said. “These tenants were unable to defend themselves on their own because greedy out-of-town investors and the community should stand up for them because it can happen to any one of us. That is the reality.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is. – Brandon Baker, I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a previous interview, President of Majestic Asset Management, Inc. Brian Lezak said Majestic complied with all the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and did not violate any laws.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak in an email. “We will defend their position in court which is the proper place.”</p>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic wants to give back to the I.V. residents by providing apartment housing that is clean and affordable, and the Abrego Villas renovations were in part made to reduce water consumption.</p>\n<p>“The management willingly made additional changes which will also allow the property to use other utilities more efficiently, which again is in support of the conservation goals of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara,” Lezak said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrew Prieto said he plans to participate in the picket to support the local community and “make a statement” about what kind of treatment residents are willing to accept from landlords.</p>\n<p>“Those removed from their homes will get the justice and equal treatment they deserve,” Prieto said. “The point of the rally isn’t to attack people or attack the property companies but bring attention to the injustices and hope that attention will foster a change.</p>\n<p>Brandon Baker, an I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate, said he plans to attend the march to fulfill a desire to create positive change.</p>\n<p>“I just didn’t think it was enough to read about the eviction and sit at home,” Baker said. “I wanted to actually be a part of the movement or process to bring change. We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is.”</p>\n<p>Baker said the Abrego evictions present another example of poor treatment of resident in an environment in which students are already abused by landlords who charge too much for rent in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Rent’s already high enough and I have to buy food and gas and stuff too,” Baker said. “If we let them do this, it sets a precedent for other realtors to do the same thing. I’m already paying a lot of money to live in a shithole.

Although a CSD would traditionally need authorization from LAFCO, Williams’ bill bypasses that requirement in favor of approval by the state legislature in light of LAFCO’s disapproval of past I.V. self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>Historically, every submission to LAFCO to turn I.V. into a CSD or give it other forms of local government has failed, with the commission rejecting CSD petitions for I.V. in 1972, 1975 and 1983 largely due to concerns over financial feasibility. The letter to be discussed next Thursday, written by Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr, expressed the commission’s concern about its lack of involvement in the approval process as well as issues regarding yet unwritten language of the bill and the role of landowners in the proposed CSD.</p>\n<p>“It appears that in its current form, AB 3 intends to bypass the LAFCO District formation process, which is of great concern to CALAFCO and the Santa Barbara LAFCO,” the letter states. “The bill does not state which services and powers are envisioned for a CSD. Usually CSDs fold in existing districts. Are new services envisioned?”</p>\n<p>Chair of the I.V. Property Owners Association Chuck Eckert said that establishment of a CSD for I.V. is unnecessary because the services needed to improve I.V. “already exist.”</p>\n<p>“The position of the property owners of Isla Vista is this: we don’t think that a community services district is necessary … because it wouldn’t address the problems that exist which we believe to be primarily behavioral,” Eckert said. “We believe that all the government institutions needed to address problems related to infrastructure and level of services already exist.”</p>\n<p>Eckert also said the appropriate action the legislature should take includes allowing LAFCO to approve or disapprove a CSD for I.V. after appropriate feasibility research has been done.</p>\n<p>“I think that the proper thing to be done … is to let Das Williams’ bill … set up the things that this commission cannot do,” Eckert said. “Let [the legislature] send the issue back down to [LAFCO] after, for your decision, after a neutral and thorough economic viability study to make a determination if a district is to be formed.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

Community Organizer Jonathan Abboud however said that continued neglect of I.V. by county entities such as LAFCO cannot continue if I.V. wishes to attain a form of self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The old LAFCO has a really bad reputation and history for shafting Isla Vista in the Goleta cityhood attempt and our own cityhood attempts,” Abboud said. “It’s been 45 years and nothing’s happened. It’s getting worse and doing nothing is not an option and I think that those who think we should do nothing should then do something themselves.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also said a CSD in I.V. could potentially improve property values for the area and make it a “better place to live.”</p>\n<p>“The bill does not have to bypass LAFCO; it’s still an idea, that’s just one consideration people in the community came up with,” Abboud said. “Even if a CSD is limited [in scope] some sort of policy implementation could improve Isla Vista … it could improve it in a behavioral sense and structurally.”</p>\n<p>But I.V. property owner John Putra said establishing a CSD by act of legislature could undermine the legitimacy of LAFCO by allowing anyone to bypass it.</p>\n<p>“I find the process here is very dangerous from the standpoint of setting a precedent that, once it’s adopted, is going to eviscerate LAFCO because anybody can get around the process by introducing a bill and proceeding to change districts, form districts, without the input of LAFCO,” Putra said. “If this LAFCO does not take a strong stand against this kind of process I think it’s going wind up becoming a powerless agency.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year psychology and political science double major and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk, the option of limiting LAFCO’s role in a self-governance bill for I.V. is more due to practical necessity rather than a dislike or distrust of the agency.</p>\n<p>“As far as precedent is concerned, we have already set some sort of insurmountable precedent just by the nature of being Isla Vista; our situation is so incredibly unique that it requires a unique solution,” Schunk said. “The term ‘bypass LAFCO’ is not necessarily accurate … it’s not necessarily a dislike or distrust of LAFCO; it’s simply the idea that LAFCO may not be able to, given the powers that it has, provide us with all of the things that we need.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59668\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59668\" data-attachment-id=\"59668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/lafco-delays-discussion-opposing-bill-ab-3/das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Das-Williams_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"EVPLA Cameron Schunk discusses AB-3 with students.

CSD include a user’s utilities tax, where a tax is levied on use of utilities services such as water, electricity and gas, per household. According to Eckert, because most properties in I.V. are “master metered” for water utilities for entire complexes, rather than individual units, the cost of paying taxes on water falls on the property owner, rather than the renter, which is a concern to property owners of I.V. regarding their taxes.</p>\n<p>I.V. property owner Brian Bailey said he does not want to see taxes in I.V. increase further.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been bypassed, you’ve been neutered. What’s up with that?” Bailey said. “I took out our tax bill and looked at it and saw our park district bonds that have been in place for [many] years. They comprise, on this random one I pulled out, 11 percent of my tax bill. I really don’t want more shit on my tax bill.”</p>\n<p>But while Schunk said he could not say if there was “huge community consensus” on the user’s utility tax, in small I.V. town hall meetings he said most attendees agree it is a fairer method of taxation.</p>\n<p>“If we were to do a property tax, we would see only property owners receiving that tax … and logically passing it down to us through increased rent,” Schunk said. “That’s not to say a user utilities tax won’t increase rent per se, but in the sense that cost of living will still increase if you increase taxes. That’s a fact, there’s no getting around that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Eckert encouraged LAFCO to amend their letter to include language specifically opposing the bill unless it does not bypass LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“The letter should be that this commission, you folks, opposes the bill unless it is limited to certain things and unless it leaves the issue of whether or not this district is to be formed up to you,” Eckert said.</p>\n<p>Williams said in a prior interview in December that the details of the services and other specifics on the form and function of an I.V. CSD have not been established because further input is needed from the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We do not have all of the details because it is our intention of course to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place,” Williams said. “We don’t want to rush and just decide what the shape is without continued community dialogue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD? Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation? – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>LAFCO Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said he thinks AB 3 raises questions about local government jurisdiction and that he opposes the bill entirely.</p>\n<p>“This issue is about, ‘Is it right for the state legislature to tell local people how to form a government?’” Moorehouse said. “AB 3 needs to be pulled. It needs to no longer exist and you need to go through the right process and let [LAFCO] help you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he respects Moorhouse’s position, he “respectfully disagrees” with it.</p>\n<p>“Part of what we saw at LAFCO is proof that perhaps Mr. Moorhouse needs to do more research into the exact nature of the legislative process for one, and perhaps also be more open-minded to … what we’ve been saying the whole time,” Schunk said. “We’ve never once said that we are doing this because we hate LAFCO and want them to have no part of this; that is not the issue here.”</p>\n<p>According to Moorhouse, who supports the letter in its present form, the university, the county and SBCC are partially responsible for perpetuating problems inherent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I see the housing crisis, overcrowding, the planning, the parking, the lighting, the sidewalks — it’s all stuff that should have been done,” Moorhouse said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of coming here, ‘LAFCO come help us with a CSD’ you should be taking your time going in front of the county board of supervisors and tell them to start throwing some money your way to start fixing some of these problems because they do have the resources.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he disagrees with Moorhouse’s comments on LAFCO’s ability to adequately help I.V. given its history of shooting down prior self-governance proposals.</p>\n<p>“Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD?” Shunk said. “Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the county has limited funding to provide to I.V. because of the realities of governing the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr and most of county administrators will agree that the county is doing [its] best and if they could wave their magic wand they would have more revenues and resources for the people of Isla Vista,” Williams said. “But because they represent a countywide government they can’t [allocate] revenue just for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59590\" style=\"width: 328px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59590\" data-attachment-id=\"59590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/doreen-farr-coffee-collab/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Doreen-Farr-Office-Hourse_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1184%2C788&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1184,788\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr spoke with students during her \\\"office hours\\\" at the Coffee Collaborative on Thursday afternoon.

Parks and Rec District (IVRPD) board member Paola De La Cruz, Moorhouse’s comments on getting the university more involved in governing I.V. already been tried without success.</p>\n<p>“We have seen that the university and entities in Isla Vista are not addressing these needs … there are other needs that need addressing and they aren’t doing that,” De La Cruz said. “So his response for us to go out to them and to ask for help. We have already done that … so we need to take a bigger step and do something that will actually address our needs.”</p>\n<p>Williams said AB 3 does not set such a precedent, nor does it seek to completely sideline LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“There are many CSDs that have been established by the legislature,” Williams said. “This would not be the first; it is not a precedent … LAFCO has an important role in the formation of local government and I want to respect that as much as possible … at the very least [LAFCO] should inspect the financial feasibility report and have an oversight role in the financial feasibility of a CSD for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, details on what LAFCO’s oversight role on financial feasibility will be for an I.V. CSD has yet to be determined and that the time for action on a new government for I.V. must happen soon, as the consequences of inaction could result in damage to the community.</p>\n<p>“To me that the most important thing here is that there are people who will be hurt by our failure to take action,” Williams said. “LAFCO might wonder why we are moving so quickly.

Food Co-op board member Jeff Bessmer resigned after serving as IVPRD board member for over two years to pursue a job opportunity managing a co-op in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n<p>IVRPD director Alex Rodriguez has temporarily taken over the position as Chairperson and Director Pegeen Soutar moved to become vice-chairperson. Bessmer’s resignation has initiated a search for a permanent replacement, with the IVRPD currently collecting letters of interest to fill the vacancy.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the IVRPD board of directors will not be running a special election due to its high costs and arduous process.</p>\n<p>“We’ve never run a special election for a board member,” Soutar said. “They’re expensive and they’re complicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the selection process involves a given candidate sending in a letter of interest, speaking to the board at a meeting and answering any questions the board may have for the prospective candidate. Soutar said she is personally looking for a candidate that can balance the number of students and long-term residents on the board.</p>\n<p>“I like to have balance on the board,” Soutar said. “I think students have enthusiasm and great ideas, but I also think that long-term residents bring continuity.”</p>\n<p>Associate Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes to see the IVRPD board of directors increase their local involvement by sponsoring more events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see the [IVRPD] board sponsoring more community events like Meet Your Neighbor Day,” Schunk said. “[But] in the end it boils down to what there are resources for.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the Board of Directors is accepting letters of interest from prospective candidates from now until Mar. 6, and the letter should include the candidate’s name, address, contact information and a brief statement regarding their intent to run.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the IVRPD board is hand-selecting the new board member to complete Bessmer’s unfinished term as board member from now until Dec. 2016.</p>\n<p>“[The candidate] is appointed by the board and will finish out the outgoing board members term, which will be through December 2016,” Gould said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday,

Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents California’s 19th district including Santa Barbara, introduced Senate Bill 186 on Monday, which would authorize California community colleges to discipline students with suspension or expulsion for off-campus conduct.</p>\n<p>The bill would allow individual community colleges to develop criteria for when to exercise their new authority and would enable them to discipline students alongside the law enforcement for sexual assault, physical abuse, threats of violence, arson-related offenses, sexual harassment, stalking and hazing. SB 186 amends Section 76034 of the California Education Code, which currently states that on community college campuses, “No student shall be removed, suspended, or expelled unless the conduct for which the student is disciplined is related to college activity or college attendance.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said her bill is a response to concerns voiced by community college students and representatives, who she continuously consulted while writing SB 186.</p>\n<p>“In doing this bill, I was listening carefully to concerns that were expressed by, particularly, our own community colleges both in Santa Barbara and in the other parts of the district, which were very concerned about the limited scope of their ability to discipline,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>SBCC President Lori Gaskin said the bill would provide an important resource for the college to police its student body.</p>\n<p>“Senator Jackson and I have talked about areas that provide options for California community colleges to ensure the standards of student conduct are understood and honored,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would hold Isla Vista residents who attend SBCC to the same behavioral standards already enforced on UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We have students who live in Isla Vista who are given a pass for behavior that subjects our university students to some kind of disciplinary action,” Jackson said. “There’s really no excuse in my opinion for allowing a pass to someone for this kind of egregious behavior while other students are subject to discipline.”</p>\n<p>However, Gaskin also said while she is glad Jackson authored the bill, it is “bittersweet” that the legislation is necessary to maintain student discipline and that there are better ways to encourage good behavior.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like engaging my students in a negative way,” Gaskin said. “I like engaging them in a positive way — making them aware of our expectation that they’re scholars first and foremost and that they are pursuing this gift of higher education.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said SB 186 would help law enforcement maintain safety in areas surrounding campuses by including community colleges in that process.</p>\n<p>“I believe that extended jurisdiction can have positive outcomes when it is used appropriately,” Plastino said. “I believe that the bill is a good start to empowering community colleges in their efforts to keep their students and neighboring communities safe.”</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC undeclared major Daniela Hunt said she agrees with the general idea behind the bill, but expressed concerns about its potential for overreaches of authority.</p>\n<p>“If the student was in trouble for something drinking-related, it should not be the school’s concern and the student has a right to privacy,” Hunt said.</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC engineering major Colin Andrews said he agrees with the idea of holding college students living in the same community to the same standard, even if they attend different schools.</p>\n<p>“I think the bill is good in that it will hold SBCC student[s] living in Isla Vista accountable to their school in the same way as their neighboring UCSB students,” Andrews said. “I just hope that authority would really only be used for serious crimes with victims.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said she recognizes the need for discipline but hopes students take the time to consider the consequences of their actions before the disciplinary process becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>“I like to ensure students recognize — from the get-go as freshman — that this is an important time of life,” Gaskin said. “There are reasonable expectations and standards of conduct that a reasonable person is expected to abide by in a college setting.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Students Debbie Fleming said it would be good for SBCC and UCSB students living in I.V. to have consistent rules.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, where we have both UC and SBCC students living and socializing together, this new bill will help to create more consistent accountability and level the expectations and consequences for student residents,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>According to Fleming, the university strictly adheres to a code of conduct that is very similar to what SBCC would likely adopt similar policies if SB 186 is passed.</p>\n<p>“Our code of conduct allows us to exercise off-campus jurisdiction over physical abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment, threats of violence or other conduct that threatens the health or safety of any persons,” Fleming said. “When serious and concerning behavior is brought to our attention, either by community members or law enforcement, we will investigate and pursue a conduct case that could be forwarded to the appropriate Conduct Committee for a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Jackson, who co-authored California’s recent “Yes Means Yes” bill with Senator Kevin de Leon, said this bill is part of her long-standing commitment to addressing sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“It identifies certain behaviors that are deemed to be egregious, and sexual assault is one of them,” Jackson said. “I have talked to some women’s groups who have also been supportive of the concept.”</p>\n<p>Hunt said she thinks SB 186 would increase accountability for perpetrators of sexual assault, creating a sense of security for students.</p>\n<p>“If the school is notified of those students it will definitely add a layer of protection because the community will feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is punished or under investigation,” Hunt said. “The school should investigate in that case and make sure that the student is guilty, and if so the school should be notified and take necessary actions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

<p>The Department of Sociology will host a research conference this Friday and Saturday to celebrate the graduate program’s 50th anniversary.</p>\n<p>The two-day conference will be held in the Corwin Pavilion on Friday and at the Mosher Alumni House on Saturday and will feature a number of speakers and research presentations from universities across the country, including an introduction by Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The department was recently ranked number one in the country by the online database College Factual ranking last month.</p>\n<p>Sociology Department chair and professor Maria Charles said the conference is aimed at celebrating the milestone while also reflecting upon the department’s work in the field.</p>\n<p>“Our Ph.D. program was founded in the 1964-65 academic year, so one reason is to celebrate the major milestone, and the other reason is to consider UCSB’s Department of Sociology’s intellectual contributions, particularly looking at fields in which we have had [an] intellectual role in over the years,” Charles said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s program, topics that will be presented include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, globalization, ethnography, conversation analysis and social movements. Charles said she is excited to see the presentations on issues that have significant implications for society.</p>\n<p>“The speakers will be reflecting on the development of certain sociological subfields over the past 50 years,” Charles said. “We’re also looking at the impact of the department in terms of contributions to broader social good, because our faculty is very interested in doing research that is socially relevant and that address important social problems of today.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, 10 former department chairs will be attending the event in addition to current sociology professors. Sociology graduate student Corrie Ellis said she decided to help coordinate the event and bring back former faculty for the opportunity to meet past faculty and department chairs and reflect on the history of the department.</p>\n<p>“I really got to know and interview some of the sociology faculty that has made UCSB sociology what it is today,” Ellis said. “It’s a special opportunity for all of us and especially graduate students to learn about the history of UCSB sociology, which I think is a very radical history and I’m very proud to be part of it.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, after talking to former faculty and chairs, she and another graduate student developed a timeline of faculty and chairs that will be displayed at the conference.</p>\n<p>UCLA sociology professor Steven Clayman, who received his Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology, said he is excited for the graduate program and looks forward to commemorating his alma mater.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to have come from that world-class program and it’s really great that they are now reaching their 50th anniversary,” Clayman said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/","id":2912,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2911,2910,2909],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate members listen intently during their weekly meeting in the Flying A room. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss resolutions on former Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young’s retirement celebration, Gaucho Health Insurance and the campus climate survey.</p>\n<p>After receiving the resolution to celebrate Young’s 25 years as vice chancellor, Young attended Senate and said he was confident in the student body to continue a legacy of upstanding community members.</p>\n<p>“You students, your current generation and those that preceded you have always had a sense of community, had a sense of something bigger and more important than they are, have really always been in my mind on the right side of history,” Young said.  “Students have always been on the right side of history because you think beyond what is the present.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy spoke about a recent Alumni Association meeting in which the possible restructuring of the Division of Student Affairs by moving the location of Career Services to the Alumni Association was discussed.</p>\n<p>“I have to share publicly that I am very opposed to that structural relocation of Career Services,” Guthy said. “Although they were having a preliminary discussion on the idea, I want you to be aware though those discussions are being had.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, she will be meeting with a committee to explore the restructuring further, although no decisions have been made about moving forward with the proposal. Guthy said the move would not solve any existing problems because there is a lack of alumni staff dedicated to Career Services.</p>\n<p>“I am not saying that they couldn’t develop that [staff] over time, but right now they have absolutely no career service,” Guthy said, “I think that it should be controlled by a Department that for years has been focused on undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Vice President Angela Lau updated the Senate on last week’s news that the Student Health Board was considering lowering financial aid given to students not enrolled in the Gaucho Health Insurance plan. Lau said a compromise has been reached that will offer financial aid to students enrolled in a private plan equal to the average insurance costs for students insured outside the university plan.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a standard that takes the average of how much students usually pay for health insurance and that’s how much will be applied towards financial aid, instead of getting like nothing,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also discussed the campus climate survey and said three campus goals regarding increased student services is in progress.</p>\n<p>“The three goals that the University has identified as the most important from that survey were working to create better services for LGBTQ identified students and underrepresented minorities on campus, sexual assault prevention and the aftermath and staff morale,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s meeting, senators also approved a resolution directing the A.S. Ticket Office to undergo the i&gt;clicker rental program, sent the 24 hour café resolution to committee, discussed greener alternatives to blue test booklets and passed the A.S. Legal Code update.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thurday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/a-s-discusses-youngs-retirement-ghi/","id":2913,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2912,2911,2910],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic on 970 Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Attendees strategized ways to get more input from residents regarding current and prior self-governance discussions and deliberated the May 15 deadline for an amended AB3 bill to include legal language addressing the need for self-governance in I.V. Currently AB3, introduced into the assembly by Williams, cannot be voted upon because it lacks explicit directions for the way I.V. will to be governed.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and longtime resident Pegeen Soutar said the approaching deadline to provide specific legal language in a month is unrealistic and “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>“I am really uncomfortable trying to come up with something in one month,” Soutar said. “It is hard for us to get our heads around and I can’t even imagine the general public who have not been sitting in on these meetings. I don’t think we have all the facts yet. The idea of having something tangible by May is overwhelming to me.”</p>\n<p>Local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman said he was disappointed in the turnout at the town hall, due to both the low attendance number and lack of older community members.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how few people came. At previous town hall meetings a very large number of people have come,” Freeman said. “The previous town halls had a lot of older people, and at this meeting there were very few older people, it was almost all students. I was really surprised at the massive change.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, residents should be informed of the discussion topics before the meeting for future town halls.</p>\n<p>“It might have been really interesting to have had in the documentation that was sent out specifying what kind of things were going to be talked about, one of which being a community center,” Freeman said. “Because then people might have thought, ‘Oh, that’s a thing I care about.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60712\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60712\" data-attachment-id=\"60712\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/isla-vista-stakeholders-meeting-02102015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423565074\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60712\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=342%2C226\" alt=\"Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus\" width=\"342\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. community members listen at Tuesday night’s stakeholders meeting. <i>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Attendees at Tuesday’s meeting discussed how to better understand the needs of the community, particularly those of long-term renters and Latino families. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said Associated Students provides an I.V. Survey to gauge community opinions.</p>\n<p>“There’s an Associated Students in Isla Vista survey that deals directly with which services people would like to see,” Schunk said. “If we’re talking about biases and skewing results there is a large possibility that it is skewed because the survey is from the perspective of the student asking what services Associated Students can provide.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the EVPLA office is attempting to take into account the sentiments of Latino families and community members in addition to students in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“That survey obviously is limited in scope, but that outreach is largely from my office targeting Latino families and community members and so we’re trying to wrap that into this outreach,” Schunk said. “That’s a slow-going process, a lot of what we’re encountering is a lack of trust amongst community members in Associated Students, which has been around for a long, long time. We’re working to alleviate that.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said a professional firm will conduct a new fiscal study to better illuminate if and how I.V. could raise revenue to address community needs.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing a financial feasibility study by a professional firm,” Elliott said. “That’s going to give us a lot of the hard numbers, so these conversations are mostly educational and starting to get feedback and peoples’ general thoughts on it but obviously when we get those hard numbers that’s what’s going to mean the most.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said determining which services are needed in I.V. and how to pay for those services are an integral component of the self-government process.</p>\n<p>“That’s the critical thing in this whole process — finding out what services are lacking and how much is being spent at the level they’re at,” Gould said, “Where do we want that level to be and how much more is that going to take. Put a price tag on each one of those services, figure out what we want as a community and then pick and choose the services we’re going to spend our money on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/","id":4763,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4762,4761,4760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Feb. 6-9","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista, including reports of assault, prowling and thefts.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista, including reports of assault, prowling and thefts.</p>\n<p>On Monday, law enforcement answered a call on Camino Pescadero concerning I.V. resident Manuel Rodriguez, who threw two DVD cases at a victim after an argument. Both cases hit the victim in the leg, and she whom suffered swelling and bruising on her inner right knee. Rodriguez became highly agitated once the authorities arrived. The victim later signed a citizen’s arrest and Rodriguez was taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies responded to a call for a possible verbal altercation between domestic partners on the 6600 block of Trigo. Subsequent investigation found there was no argument taking place. However, the 19-year-old male resident, Jose Benitez of Santa Barbara, had three outstanding misdemeanor warrants and was arrested.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, an I.V. Foot Patrol bicycle unit was deployed throughout I.V. and issued eight citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations, and two physical arrests, one for lewd behavior and the other for prowling at a local church.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 15 citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations. Also, all IVFP units responded to Storke Road in front of Rusty’s Pizza for a traffic collision with a severe injury and a subject pinned under a vehicle. A juvenile pedestrian was struck as she waited with her family at the bus stop. The driver of the vehicle had lost control immediately after a traffic collision with another driver and then veered onto the curb and bus stop area.</p>\n<p>On Saturday three deputies made six physical arrests and 12 citations.</p>\n<p>At approximately midnight, deputies responded to a call about a suspect prowling in the backyard of a property on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect was described as a black male adult, wearing a red baseball cap, grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and carrying a red duffel bag and laptop. Deputies detained the suspect in the alleyway behind the residence on suspicion of prowling. A line-up was conducted and the subjects who had seen him prowling identified him, though they decided they did not want to pursue charges. The identified suspect was not in possession of a duffel bag, and when K9 units arrived on scene, they were unable to locate the duffel bag. The suspect is a person of interest in several possessions of stolen property cases. Because no stolen property was found, the suspect was released and a report was filed for documentation purposes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60720\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60720\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/","id":3773,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3772,3771,3770],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":127,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
