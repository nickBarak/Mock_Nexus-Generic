Dhadkan, which means “heartbeat” in Hindi, was founded by fourth-year students Soham Tikekar and Nishitha Viswanathan during their freshman year when they were studying physics in the library.</p>\n<p>The organization manages and plans events that combine South Asian culture and the arts with charities that provide education to children in India. Its motto is “Philanthropy through artistry.”</p>\n<p>For the past three years, Dhadkan has sent proceeds from its events to schools throughout India, providing education in rural areas and money to build more schools. Last year, they were able to support three schools for an entire year with the funds they raised.</p>\n<p>Tikekar and Viswanathan said they were both “surprised” when they learned Dhadkan had won OSL Group of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We completely didn’t know we had a chance of winning,” said Viswanathan, a biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>Despite Tikekar and Viswanathan’s initial shock, Dhadkan has made incredible steps for the South Asian community in the past year, which led to its winning the award.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\"><p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want.”<br>\n— Soham Tikekar</p></blockquote>\n<p>From successfully hosting Nachle Deewane, an annual philanthropic South Asian dance competition in downtown Santa Barbara, to collaborating with Associated Students Program Board to bring DJ Jai Wolf to the University Center Hub, Dhadkan has made immense steps toward raising money for Indian education and bringing South Asian culture to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have accomplished a lot,” said Tikekar, a biology and economics double major. “We put in a lot of time, and it’s kind of a barrier we thought we’d have to break to get to the main campus environment. Winning this award really solidified this idea that, yeah, a cultural organization really can get to the top.”</p>\n<p>The co-founders explained that during their freshman year, they felt the South Asian presence on campus was lacking. By creating Dhadkan, they expanded the possibilities for South Asian students and made UCSB a more welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make our mark on this campus, and we both grew up with Indian arts and Indian culture; we were just surrounded by it,” Viswanathan said. “Then we came here, and we kind of didn’t get that same experience, so we wanted to do something.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71639\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"443103063\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71618\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71639\" data-attachment-id=\"71639\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71639\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o-1024x681.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71639\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tikekar and Viswanathan announce awards for winners at the 2016 Nachle Deewane competition. <em>Courtesy of Lorenzo Basilio for UCSB Dhadkan</em></p></div>\n<p>Tikekar said Dhadkan’s dedication to children’s education in India stemmed from the group’s belief that “education is the most sustainable branch of philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want,” Tikekar said.</p>\n<p>Many Indians do not receive an education past grade school, Tikekar and Viswanathan said, and so they work to provide Indian children a full education so they can achieve their career goals and provide for their families.</p>\n<p>“Even though, officially, child labor is illegal, it’s obviously still very prevalent in a country like India, so [children] automatically go into the workforce, and that’s their entire life,” Viswanathan said. “With an education … they can bring their family and themselves out of that poverty cycle.”</p>\n<p>As finals roll in and graduation day approaches, Tikekar and Viswanathan are beginning to think about their post-commencement plans and how they can incorporate their experience with Dhadkan into the competitive job market.</p>\n<p>Viswanathan said she has developed skills through Dhadkan that are “very applicable” to life beyond college, such as learning about managing and running an organization and interacting and communicating with colleagues and venue owners;

If given nonprofit status, Tikekar said he hopes Dhadkan could achieve goals even beyond those of a university organization.</p>\n<p>“As graduates and us as alumni of the school, we hope to still mentor and guide the people who still go here and [are] actually creating their own projects,” Tikekar said. “Hopefully, next year and the year after, we can design our own charity work, maybe go to India and execute it ourselves rather than just donating to a third party nonprofit.”</p>\n<p>“Once we all graduate, we have that alumni network,” Tikekar added. “Everyone is doing different things in different industries, they have different skill sets, so at one point we ideally want to come together to do a project.”</p>\n<p>Of course, before Tikekar and Viswanathan can put those skills to use, they have to walk across the commencement stage and receive their diplomas.</p>\n<p>“I’m remembering back to the time when we were freshmen and we didn’t have sort of a comfort zone here,” Tikekar said. “We’ve built that over the last four years. I’m looking forward to seeing where stepping out of my comfort zone is after I graduate, after I leave this one right here.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of  the Thursday, June 2, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate called upon UC Santa Barbara Audit and Advisory Services to investigate the allegations.</span></p>\n<p>The committee found that the grants were “intended as more of a contest among IFC member fraternities” than a bribe, Robert Tarsia, directory of audit and advisory services, said in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Investigation-Report-re-Spring-Elections-Preliminary-Findings-052616.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez, on May 26.</p>\n<p>Because the grants did not encourage voting for specific candidates and measures and were intended to be awarded to fraternity chapters instead of individuals, Tarsia says, the committee found no evidence of bribery.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 6, the A.S. Elections Board issued a public <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ALetterfromtheA.S.ElectionsBoard.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">apology</a> to the IFC. Although it stands by its decision to bring the issue to the public, the board said its allegation of bribery was “the wrong word to use and a bold accusation to make.” </span></p>\n<p>“We are genuinely sorry for any damage we did to the reputations of any organizations or fellow students,” the board states in its apology. “The intention of our letter was not to vilify any student or group, but rather to inform the student body of our concerns.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board also apologized to Gonzalez, saying that it “unintentionally hurt a fellow student” while pursuing its goal of ensuring a fair election process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of Elections Board knows how difficult it is to be a student, so we apologize for the added pressure, scrutiny and unwanted attention our accusation has brought Brendan,” the board states. </span></p>\n<p>According to its letter, the audit and advisory committee came to its conclusion after interviewing several parties, including the student who initially brought the complaint to the elections board, as well as IFC Council Advisor Miles Ashlock and IFC President Brendan Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Ashlock, who is also the assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, told the committee that he approved the original grant program, based on his understanding that all money would be used for “charitable activities.”</p>\n<p>The letter says participation in the program was voluntary, and “participation thresholds” would determine the amount of grant money awarded, between $200 and $400 for the winning chapter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community.”</p>\n<p>— Brendan Gonzalez</p></blockquote>\n<p>The IFC intended to distribute the grants after the election, but Gonzalez said they have currently suspended the program in light of the ongoing investigation. If further results continue to prove that the IFC grants were not bribes, however, Gonzalez said the program will likely continue as planned.</p>\n<p>The committee also interviewed Marquez, the A.S Elections Board and other members of the A.S. staff, according to the letter, and Tarsia notes that the committee researched the spring election through campus newspaper articles and social media posts.</p>\n<p>As it continues the investigation, the committee will determine whether the IFC’s intended grants resulted in “serious voting irregularity as a result of undue influence on student voting.” It will also research if the grants violated the A.S. Elections Code, Campus Elections Commission Guidelines or Campus Regulations.</p>\n<p>The committee says in the letter that the A.S Elections Board was acting in an “unprecedented” situation and acknowledges that its request for an investigation was “a prudent one.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez initially responded to the bribery allegations in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April, saying that “The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants.” In an email Wednesday, he said he was glad the preliminary findings confirmed what he has  “known and repeated from the start.”</span></p>\n<p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community,” Gonzalez, a second-year political science major, said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the A.S. Senate is no longer in session, outgoing A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal, who shared Tarsia’s report in an email Wednesday, said further matters regarding the investigation will be directed by the Villarreal Election Commission. The Senate </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the commission last Wednesday, and Villarreal is currently in the process of appointing 10 members to sit on the board. There is “no known timeline” for the Audit and Advisory Committee’s investigation, Villarreal said last week.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p>[Update June 6: This article has been updated to include an apology statement from the A.S.

Current seniors entered college as Barack Obama began his second term as president and were a year later confronted with both the Deltopia riots and the May 23, 2014, shooting as most phased into their twenties.</p>\n<p>The self-governance movement in Isla Vista took hold later that year, and students and faculty came together to improve life in the small college town. Now, another presidential election has taken young people by the reins, and graduating students are facing the future with contrasting college experiences.</p>\n<p>The four-year graduation rate for UCSB students typically fluctuates around 68 percent, according to the UCSB Campus Profile, and 4,687 students are scheduled to attend commencement ceremonies on June 11 and 12, according to Cathy Pollock, assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_8fb6d586-3953-4c78-a23c-032c7a0f6c57\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?B8C\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>While the majority of graduating students are seniors, this number includes students from other class levels who will be graduating early, as well as students who graduated prior to Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Although students from the College of Letters &amp; Science are able to attend whichever commencement ceremony they choose, the largest group of students is scheduled to graduate with the social sciences division, numbering over 2,000 students. UCSB’s largest undergraduate departments are physical and biological sciences at 31 percent, followed by social and cultural studies at 14 percent.</p>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS), UCSB’s smallest college, will be graduating approximately 90 students next week. Maintaining CCS’s standard of “A Graduate School for Undergraduates,” nearly half of CCS seniors will head to graduate school next year. Approximately 20 percent of the remaining students plan to pursue graduate education in the following year, and 17 percent are headed straight to their prospective careers.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_fba0f287-85f9-47b4-a02c-ceebd29991ee\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?2Dp\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am\" target=\"_blank\">Create your own infographics</a></div>\n<p>CCS students will be attending schools across the country including Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Duke and Berklee College of Music, according to Sara Sterphone, student affairs officer for CCS. A little over 2 percent of students will continue research at UCSB, and other students will attend in-state programs at Chapman, Stanford, UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>When the current senior class enrolled as freshmen, 44 percent of applicants were admitted to UCSB and 18,977 undergraduates populated the university. The school has since grown to accommodate 20,607 undergraduates, and UCSB accepted 32.7 percent of applicants in 2015.</p>\n<p>Along with rising numbers, UCSB’s demographics have undergone significant shifts since 2012. In fall 2015, UCSB was named a Hispanic Serving Institution due to its significant enrollment of students who identify as Chicano/a and Latino/a. Reflecting the criteria for this title, this demographic now represents 27 percent of the undergraduate population as opposed to 24 percent four years ago.</p>\n<p>To offset reduced funding from the state, UCSB has also shifted its enrollment of in-state students along with the rest of the University of California. In fall 2012, 94 percent of UCSB students were California residents and the remainder were out-of-state or international residents. In-state enrollment percentages have gone down by 4 percent as of 2015, and 6 percent of students are now enrolled from outside of California. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes have sparked controversy throughout the state and students and legislators are pushing the UC to prioritize residents of California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC, although disputed, will continue to change, and as seniors look back on their education, they will remember varying bits of the institutions that placed them in adulthood. For now, they scramble to complete the last of their exams and face the next few months with confusion, excitement and an ever-critical outlook. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/","id":2463,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2462,2461,2460],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sorority and Isla Vista Pastor Honored by Red Cross","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Red-Cross-Photo-Courtesy-Morris-Franklin-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Red-Cross-Photo-Courtesy-Morris-Franklin-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alpha Delta Pi earned the Lifesaving Blood Hero award for its biannual blood drives, and the Rev.

Jon-Stephen Hedges, the pastor who was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-07/ucsb-student-charged-with-assaulting-pastor-in-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">assaulted</a> by a UC Santa Barbara student in his Isla Vista home last month, and the Gamma Xi chapter of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The sorority, established in 1950 as one of UCSB’s original seven sororities, has been hosting blood drives for the last five years as part of its philanthropic work. The sorority was awarded the Lifesaving Blood Hero award for its members’ efforts.</p>\n<p>For the last two years, the Alpha Delta Pi has held a blood drive in both the fall and spring quarters. During its most recent blood drive, 87 students and Isla Vistans donated hundreds of pints of blood to the Red Cross.</p>\n<p>“It is a constant need in our community,” Danielle Moss, the sorority’s philanthropy chair, said, having donated blood since she was first eligible in high school.</p>\n<p>Sarah Whitman, the sorority’s recruitment and marketing vice president, said that, at times, encouraging blood donations is easier than trying to procure financial contributions.</p>\n<p>“Asking people to donate blood is easier than asking people to donate money,” Whitman, a second-year psychology and sociology double major, said at the Carr Vineyards and Winery in downtown Santa Barbara, which hosted the reception for Red Cross honorees.</p>\n<p>Whitman noted that the Red Cross is one of the sorority’s many philanthropic endeavors. Alpha Delta Pi regularly fundraises for the Ronald McDonald House and has members participating in charity dance marathons and UCSB’s Relay for Life, which raised nearly $10,000 for cancer research.</p>\n<p>Moss said the blood donations were successful, in part, because sorority members “blasted it all over social media,” saturating students’ news feeds with information about the drive. She said it was an honor to be rewarded by the greater Santa Barbara community, adding that Greek life is often subject to “bad media coverage.”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to be recognized outside of UCSB,” Moss, a third-year sociology major, said. “Sororities are one of the most social circles, and you can either put that to waste or use the power of numbers to give back.”</p>\n<p>The Red Cross also awarded Hedges, known locally as Father Jon, and four other chaplains with the Disaster Services Hero award. Hedges, who volunteers as a chaplain for Isla Vista Foot Patrol and other agencies, is a UCSB alumnus and has lived in Isla Vista since 1968.</p>\n<p>Hedges was assaulted in May by a UCSB student, Paul Gusman, who forced his way into the reverend’s house and repeatedly punched him in the face. Hedges said he believes Gusman is “a good kid” and that drugs “took over him, and that’s a game changer for his life.”</p>\n<p>Hedges mentioned the 2014 Isla Vista shooting as an example of when chaplains are vital to emergency workers and community members suffering from a tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We get called in those moments not to be all religious, but to be a calm presence,” Hedges said. “I’m not there to teach Sunday school, I’m there to be more of a psychologist.”</p>\n<p>The Rev. Mort Ward, who advises all Red Cross chaplains in the Central Coast area, presented the award Wednesday night and encouraged attendees to keep emergency respondents in their thoughts.</p>\n<p>When pulling over for an ambulance or fire truck, Ward said, “if you’re a person of faith, send a prayer and, if not, send a good thought.”</p>\n<p>“The people you see to my right,” Ward said, motioning to the chaplains at the front of the room, “take that prayer or good thought a step forward … because that is what is so desperately needed at that moment.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of  the Thursday, June 2, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Instead, she said all organizations must seek to understand science and its worldwide implications.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen, very recently, several discussions going on in both the news and among politicians about things like climate change, questions about vaccinations, questions about various topics … questions all about policy making,” Lunsford said.</p>\n<p>Lunsford said students from all departments are encouraged to apply for the minor if they have an interest in understanding scientific research.</p>\n<p>“As long as you’re interested in a S.T.E.M. topic, we can help teach you how to read that material,” Lunsford said. “It is a different route from someone who already has that major, but we do need people coming in from both directions, seeing what people can understand and interpret for another audience.”</p>\n<p>Professor Doug Bradley, who will teach scientific literacy in the Winter Quarter, said his class will specialize in learning the basic concepts of science and how students can use multimedia to deliver the information to a large audience.</p>\n<p>Bradley said course assignments will have students presenting data in “unique ways” to connect non-S.T.E.M. people to the science field through scientific and quantitative graphics.</p>\n<p>“In terms of science communication, good practice would be to connect as efficiently as possible with your audience, a broad audience … and convey ideas and issues to them that will get them to orient their lives in ways that accord with rational scientific thinking,” Bradley said.</p>\n<p>Professor Janet Mizrahi, who will be teaching science communication for the public, said her students will spend Spring Quarter writing press releases and news stories, creating websites and recording podcasts.</p>\n<p>Mizrahi wants students to learn the best ways to communicate in the workplace through writing and technology, regardless of the career they eventually pursue.<br>\n“I hope they not only become better citizens and better writers, but also more marketable college graduates,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p>Bradley said “it is particularly urgent right now,” for students to learn from the minor because UCSB was recently ranked eighth in worldwide research by the international Leiden Ranking system.</p>\n<p>“That means our professionals need to make darn sure the information they’re conveying to the public is spot on target,” he continued. “We’re trying to support that leadership that the campus is already showing and push it out even further.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the

all campus services on June 16, affecting access cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students.</p>\n<p>Celestino Jones, a second-year music composition major, came out as transgender during the beginning of his second year at UCSB. “I’ve been stopped at the dining commons before because I don’t look like a ‘Celeste,’” Jones said, after undergoing hormone therapy that changed his appearance.</p>\n<p>He now has the opportunity to purchase a new access card with his preferred name without having to legally change his documentation.</p>\n<p>“It grew out of the desire to support transgender students specifically, because there are many transgender students whose legal name is not consistent with their identity,” Leesa Beck, the university registrar, said. She also hopes the efforts will improve academic experiences for international students who may use alternate names.</p>\n<p>Students are currently able to change their name through Identity Services or by submitting a petition to the registrar. Certain programs, such as G.O.L.D., source data directly from the registrar’s office, but many organizations such as GauchoSpace interact with numerous other databases like Identity Services.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the summer, the registrar’s office hopes to streamline all name change requests by communicating their information to as many “data feeds” as possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We think we have caught most of the major ones, but there are literally hundreds around the campus, so we may continue to find ones that we have missed, and have to make updates after we go live,” Beck said.</p>\n<p>Departments that require legal verification, such as the financial aid office, Student Health and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services, are the only groups that will receive both the legal name and the preferred name for each student. Staff members at these locations will be directed to use preferred names when addressing students and legal names when submitting and verifying claims, Beck said.</p>\n<p>The new system will only allow students to change first names, requiring legal documentation to change last names. Although this leaves room for falsification, Beck said she has spoken with schools who use preferred names and found that students “almost never abuse the system.”</p>\n<p>“It would be like putting a weird fake name on LinkedIn or something. No one wants that to be the name their professors are calling them by,” she said. “So for now there will be no “policing” of the names entered. If it becomes a problem down the line, we will reassess.”</p>\n<p>The registrar’s office will be working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to publicize and implement the changes after Spring Quarter grades are finalized.</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, the director of the RCSGD, said “a lot of people take names and pronouns for granted” because they never feel misrepresented by their legal name.</p>\n<p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift,” he said. “We just want students to feel like there are services in place that validate the experiences that they are having.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way.” — Celestino Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>When beginning previous quarters at UCSB, Jones said he would sometimes find himself staying quiet during roll call, waiting until the end of class to correct his teachers about his name. He is “grateful” that professors and teaching assistants will only have access to his preferred name next year, and said several other students will benefit as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way,” he said. “It can alleviate a lot of stress, I suppose, if the name that you prefer is the name that everyone calls you by.”</p>\n<p>Although the new system will be implemented throughout UCSB in the fall, Jones, who is a chair for the RCGSD transgender taskforce, said it will not be a “fix-all” for transgender inclusivity. He explained that faculty members can learn about gender identity and make students feel safe by asking them about their preferred pronouns.</p>\n<p>“I know that even though I told people my preferred name, there were still some folks who made the mistakes of using the wrong pronouns,” Jones said. “It’s all about being educated!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 26, 2016, edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/","id":2460,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2459,2458,2457],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gambian UCSB Student Granted Political Asylum in the United States","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Once living out of his car and contemplating suicide, student Alagie Jammeh now has a bright future in the U.S.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71435\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71435\" data-attachment-id=\"71435\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-by-jenny-luo-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71435 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"UCSB student Alagie Jammeh gains political asylum in the United States.

Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<h2>Once living out of his car and contemplating suicide, international student Alagie Jammeh now has a bright future in the U.S.</h2>\n<p>There was a knock on the window.</p>\n<p>“Hey, what are you doing here? Are you sleeping in your car?” a policeman asked Alagie Jammeh, an international student from Gambia studying at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jammeh was in fact living out of his vehicle and struggling to feed himself, sometimes going days without food. The officer warned Jammeh he would be ticketed if he continued sleeping in his car on campus.</p>\n<p>In September 2014, Jammeh posted on Facebook that “No one should be denied their basic fundamental human rights because of their sexuality.” Though he took the post down two days later after receiving calls from relatives back home warning him of the government’s reaction to his statement, it was too late. By November, his presidential scholarship from the Gambian government was cut off.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he desired to be part of a community that embraces all people, irrespective of their gender identity. As a result of his newfound convictions, Jammeh found himself ostracized from his homeland and fearing for his life.</p>\n<p>“I was scared the Gambian government is going to send someone in America to kill me,” Jammeh said. “I was terrified that some people who disagreed with what I said on Facebook would eventually hunt me down.”</p>\n<p>Located on the west coast of Africa with a population of approximately 1.9 million, Gambia is one of 70 countries in the world that can imprison citizens for their sexual orientation. President of Gambia, Yahya Jammeh — a distant uncle of Alagie — stated during his address to the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 that homosexuality is one of the “biggest threats to human existence.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71454\" style=\"width: 894px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1203591190\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71453\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71454\" data-attachment-id=\"71454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/screen-shot-2016-05-26-at-12-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=884%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"884,621\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-26 at 12.05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=884%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71454 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=884%2C621\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-26 at 12.05\" width=\"884\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?w=884&amp;ssl=1 884w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gambia is located on the west coast of Africa, bordered by Senegal and the Atlantic Ocean.<em> Google Maps</em></p></div>\n<p>“The president of the Gambia has been saying that any gay person that come to the Gambia — we will slit your throat. We will kill you. You will go to jail for the rest of your life. We will not allow gay men or gay women in our society,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh’s view on the gay community began to change after he learned his roommate and good friend was gay.

He could lose his international student status and then become undocumented,” Simjee said. “The previous attorney had made kind of a mess with the case; there were glaring issues.”</p>\n<p>The two decided Jammeh should be represented by Public Counsel in Los Angeles because of a special agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Asylum office in L.A. that would allow for Jammeh’s request to be processed more quickly.</p>\n<p>“They have an agreement with the L.A. asylum office to hear their claims by April of the same year, whereas if had he gone with another attorney he would have been on the same schedule as everyone else, and it could take two years or more to get on the asylum calendar,” Simjee said. She went on to explain that the special agreement is because the attorneys at Public Counsel work with the UC Los Angeles School of Law, so for educational purposes students are allowed to go to the asylum hearings, which are scheduled before the end of the academic year.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I couldn’t see any single thing that is ungodly or that is mean about gay people, so I decided that it was something that I was going to change my views on.”<br>\n— Alagie Jammeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>After visiting Los Angeles to meet with his lawyer every week for about four months, Jammeh travelled to the asylum office in early April for an interview that lasted approximately four hours. Two weeks later he returned to learn whether his request for asylum would be granted.</p>\n<p>“It was this long wait. The lady before me, her case was filed to immigration court … I was scared because my case, if they deny it, has to go through immigration court, which I have to present again and do all those paper work all over again,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>But he was recommended for approval, pending a background check to ensure he had no ties to any terrorist organization and held no criminal record. Three days later, Jammeh’s request for political asylum was granted.</p>\n<p>Jammeh felt a responsibility to his supporters to make sure everything went smoothly throughout the asylum application process, according to Simjee.</p>\n<p>“He was still so nervous and there were so many pieces that were up in the air,” Simjee said. “He just cared so much about all the other people that were invested in him.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh can now work in the U.S., apply for scholarships, eventually become a permanent resident and no longer have to fear for his safety, he said he had mixed feelings when he received the news his asylum was granted because he can now never return to Gambia.</p>\n<p>“I am going to miss the Gambia itself,” he said. “Everything about that country. You know, they also call the Gambia the smiling coast of Africa because almost everyone you meet, everyone is smiling. It doesn’t matter how their day is, terrible or bad or good, they are always smiling.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh is still in touch with his mother, he no longer hears from any of his 17 siblings, many of whom called him shortly after his Facebook post in 2014 to share their disappointment over his pro-LGBT statement.</p>\n<p>“Eventually my whole family stopped talking to me at the same time; that was the toughest part of all this thing,” Jammeh said. “[They ask] is the American government trying to influence me, trying to change me … This has nothing to do with the American government, this has nothing to do with friends here. This is about me. This is about me evolving. This is about me learning new things in my college, this is about me trying to accept people.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said his only family is the people at UCSB who have reached out to support him over the last two years, but that they can never replace his brothers and sisters in Gambia.</p>\n<p>“Family is family, you know. You grew up with these people; this is blood. You know them from your childhood to becoming an adult to traveling and everyone has been there whether you are down or up,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>With graduation just three weeks out, Jammeh said he fears having to start a new life when his time at UCSB comes to a close.</p>\n<p>“You have to build a whole new family all over again; that’s terrifying,” he said. “Some of the people that I met here, like David Whitman, the bond we have, it’s going to last forever. The bond that I have with Simran and Mary Jacob … They don’t see me as another student, they see me as their friend, as their child.”</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the office of international students and scholars (OISS) where Jammeh now works, said she and Mary Jacob, senior associate dean for student affairs, made it their goal to give Jammeh as normal a life as they could.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way he doesn’t miss his family because he does. He’s a kid with 17 brothers and sisters and all of the sudden he has nobody,” Singh said. “So we’ve tried our best to give him an atmosphere where he can be himself.”</p>\n<p>Singh said she saw Jammeh “taxed to the limit” throughout the asylum application process.</p>\n<p>“You’re put in front of a person who is going to challenge everything you say, and to have the mental strength and ability to sit before somebody and actually be able to recite what’s happened to you in your life in the past, and be able to come out the way he did: phenomenal,” Singh said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s no way he doesn’t miss his family because he does. He’s a kid with 17 brothers and sisters and all of the sudden he has nobody.” — Simran Singh</p></blockquote>\n<p>When she learned Jammeh had been living out of his car, Jacob invited him to stay in her home during Spring Quarter 2015, during which time she said it took time for him to begin to feel comfortable because he didn’t want to take advantage of her hospitality.</p>\n<p>“So I made him a dish that comes from Senegal; his mom is from Senegal, so I made this stew,” Jacob said. “He said it was good. It wasn’t spicy enough. I made it pretty hot, but it wasn’t hot enough, but that I think that made him very, very happy because he couldn’t believe that I would do something like that for him.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he does not want people to just feel sorry for him, but instead hopes people will talk to him as they would any other student on campus.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I am staying on an extra quarter is to have the experiences of college life without worrying about my [asylum] papers, without worrying about other stuff, but just be a student,” he said. “I wanted that so bad. I wanted to go to school, come do your homework, Friday night go have drink with friends.”</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, director of LGBT services at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity, has worked closely with Jammeh over the last year, sometimes checking in with him multiple times a week to inquire into his well-being, manage angry family members, organize fundraising or arrange speaking engagements.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the majority of students at UCSB can’t even begin to “wrap their heads around” the sacrifices Jammeh has made.</p>\n<p>“There hasn’t been a UCSB student in collective memory that has gone through what he’s gone through, and so it’s a huge moment to honor allyship,” Whitman said. “I’ve never met an ally like him.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71448\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71448\" data-attachment-id=\"71448\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-jammeh-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<h1>                     A LOW POINT</h1>\n<p>Prior to reaching out to the university for assistance, Jammeh struggled on his own, searching for financial support that would enable him to stay in school. He applied for dozens of scholarships, but was denied each time because he was not a citizen or permanent resident in the U.S. Jammeh was alone, living out of his car, studying in the library, skipping meals.</p>\n<p>Unwilling to drop out of school for fear of being an embarrassment to his country and unable to return home to Gambia, Jammeh began contemplating suicide.</p>\n<p>“There was a point where I give up, literally give up,” Jammeh said. “I’m not going to drop out of school, that’s not an option for me. I’m not going to go back to Gambia, that’s not an option for me either. I’m not going to do anything. What I am going to do now is just end everything, just commit suicide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh was standing on the Goleta Pier at 1 a.m. determined to end his life in the ocean when he received a call from a friend. According to Jammeh, the conversation was nothing special. They talked about “stupid stuff,” but it was enough to make him reconsider taking his life.</p>\n<p>“It’s God telling me something through this guy. There is more to you than this, there is more to life than committing suicide. Committing suicide is not going to solve your problems … it’s also going to be a win for the people in the Gambia,” Jammeh said. “So stay on and fight. If you believe in what you said, just keep on fighting.”</p>\n<p>Despite the strain of being homeless and unable to pay his university expenses, Jammeh maintained a GPA well above average.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to give the government of the Gambia something to just say ‘Oh, no we didn’t cut his funding because of what he said on Facebook, but we cut his funding because he wasn’t doing too well in school,’ he said. “I was sleeping in my car, doing all that stuff, but I never have a C.”</p>\n<p>Singh said that after helping for some time, the Gambian embassy in Washington eventually stopped responding to OISS’ requests.</p>\n<p>“There have been other asylum cases but … here there were threats, but the threats were made indirectly, so even for us to prove that this was happening became very difficult,” she said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Eventually my whole family stopped talking to me at the same time — that was the toughest part of all this thing.”                  — Alagie Jammeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jammeh took a class with Sharon Farmer, chair of the history department, while he was living out of his car. Farmer said Jammeh’s self-determination enabled him to overcome the many challenges he’s faced.</p>\n<p>“On top of the financial strain, there was the whole emotion strain of his family,” Farmer said. “It seems to me that anybody who can balance all of those things and still make it through that term and a half when he was living in his car could balance the [asylum] application process on top of that.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said it was difficult to seek out counseling because of the stigma associated with it at home in Gambia.</p>\n<p>“We have this belief that counseling is for people with mental problems,” he said. “People are asking me to go to counseling, but I’m like no I’m not going to go to counseling. I don’t have a mental problem. I have a problem with my government and a problem with my family, but mentally it’s draining and it’s tough to deal with, but I think I can deal with it by myself.”</p>\n<p>While Jammeh did eventually visit the Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) center, he said he felt the experience was “a waste of time,” because the staff member he spoke with didn’t understand his culture.</p>\n<p>“Counseling has to hire people that understand about international students because, my first person that I was talking to had no clue about anything that I was talking about,” Jammeh said. “I don’t blame them for not knowing my culture, but the university has to spend to teach these people about diversity so international students will feel safe to go and talk to them.”</p>\n<p>Farmer said the faculty and staff should know the protocol for how best to help a distressed student.</p>\n<p>“[We need] to constantly inform students that there’s a place to turn because there’s a lot of mental health issues these days and we need to recognize them and get people to the help they need,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said it is incredibly important for students to watch for warning signs that their peers are in distress and talk to them about what they are going through.</p>\n<p>“When you see someone is not acting right, you just have to make an effort to talk to them,” Jammeh said. “‘Hey, what’s going on? Is everything ok?’ Those things, people see these as a small things, but they really help. When my friend called me and talked to me, that stopped everything. It’s like I was reborn again.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71449\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71449\" data-attachment-id=\"71449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-jammeh-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-682x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<h1>A NEW HOME</h1>\n<p>The first of his siblings to graduate high school, Jammeh will again break new ground in his family on June 12, becoming the first to obtain a college degree when he graduates with a Bachelor of Arts in global studies.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said the commencement date has “crept up” on him. He has plans to spend the summer break studying for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and then later apply to graduate school at UC Berkeley, USC, Columbia and Princeton.</p>\n<p>“My ultimate goal is to be able to work in the United Nations where I will impact people’s lives. I will have a voice,” Jammeh said. “My hope is to become a human rights advocate all over the world, not just for gay rights but human rights in general: women’s rights, children’s rights and other rights.”</p>\n<p>Jacob, senior associate dean for student affairs, said Jammeh could be an influential activist for gender equality in West Africa.</p>\n<p>“He can play a role as a man from that part of the world to advocate on behalf of women as any ally in forms and ways that women might not be listened to but he, as a man, could,” Jacob said. “If there were a change in government [in Gambia] maybe it would be safe enough for him to return home to work there. If not there, then maybe in neighboring countries.</p>\n<p>Whitman, director of LGBT services, described Jammeh as endlessly insightful, loving and gracious — an “old soul” who he will look up to for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>Whitman said he hopes Jammeh’s story will remind people of their own potential for giving back and reaffirm their gratitude for comfort and safety.</p>\n<p>“He had the ability to think freely despite a socialization that would tell him otherwise … he had the power in his sense of self to break out of that,” Whitman said. “How are you giving your heart and mind to someone or something that isn’t about you? He does not identify with the community. It’s not about him. He could have easily just stayed quiet and I don’t see that a lot.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh admitted that it would have been easier to remain in Gambia, where he would likely be married like many of his brothers and sisters, rather than pursuing an education in America. He attributed the decision to leave his old life behind to his desire to have control over his future.</p>\n<p>“If you’re really good at what you do, people will find it very difficult to deny you of what you want,” Jammeh said. “If you’re good at what you do, they will run out of excuses to say no. You have to decide your future for yourself.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he aims to be one of the most educated people in Africa, especially in Gambia.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There hasn’t been a UCSB student in collective memory that has gone through what he’s gone through, and so it’s a huge moment to honor allyship.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“I want children who grow up in the Gambia to think that they could become someone,” he said. “The Gambia is not going to be developed by some western or some European or some Chinese country. The Gambia is only going to be developed by the Gambian people, especially people who went to school in America or in the west to go back to Gambia and contribute.”</p>\n<p>According to Jammeh, it will take more than a change in government in Gambia for him to be able to return home. The Gambian people hold a common belief that homosexuaity is a sin and a crime against humanity.</p>\n<p>“Someone has to be advocating and talking to these communities and tell them, ‘Hey, I have a gay friend and he is normal, he thinks like you. He is smart. He is compassionate. He is loving,’” Jammeh said. “I’m really, really an optimistic person. Ten years ago, if you tell someone gay marriage is going to be legal in all 50 states in the United States, they would be like ‘What are you talking about?’ But it happened.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh admits that his hopes may not be fulfilled in his lifetime, he has faith that one day the people of Gambia will treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping … I will wake up one day and see in the news that being gay is okay all over the world, being gay is okay in Gambia and gay people could go to work, without being discriminated against, go to church or go to mosque and pray without being discriminated against, do anything they want to do without being discriminated against. That would make me very, very happy,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>Inspired in his childhood by activists like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr., Jammeh says he has only begun his journey.</p>\n<p>“I have a dream and that dream is not accomplished. I’m not even halfway there yet,” Jammeh said. “I’m not going to stop.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 26, 2016, edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> initially <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/\">reported</a> about Alagie Jammeh on July 28, 2015.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/","id":3605,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3604,3603,3602],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Declared Safe After Threat Directed at ‘Feminism Is Cancer’ Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_4955.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_4955.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The dean of student life said the campus is safe after a threat was posted on the Feminism Is Cancer event page online.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71483\" style=\"width: 562px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71483\" data-attachment-id=\"71483\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/campus-declared-safe-after-threat-directed-at-feminism-is-cancer-event/ucpd-milo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UCPD-Milo.png?fit=1279%2C1218&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1279,1218\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCPD Milo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UCPD-Milo.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UCPD-Milo.png?fit=888%2C846&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UCPD-Milo.png?resize=552%2C525\" alt=\"More than six UCPD officers provided security for the event Thursday.

Sanders (I–Vt.) will speak to SBCC students and residents of Santa Barbara from The Great Meadow on SBCC’s West Campus, a large plot of grass overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>The rally, titled “A Future to Believe In,” is free and open to the public. Doors open for the event at 7 a.m.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s campaign said in a statement that Sanders will be speaking about money in politics, climate change, health care and how to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) said the 15x, an express line between UC Santa Barbara and SBCC, will not be running on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Cynthia Boche, assistant planning manager at MTD, said none of the Saturday buses will get UCSB students to SBCC by 7 a.m., but that students may be able to arrive by 8. Boche said she expects an influx of passengers on Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people from Isla Vista will be wanting to get to the event,” she said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students can take the Line 11 bus to the downtown Transit Center and then take Line 4 or Line 17 to SBCC.</p>\n<p>Actor Danny DeVito, who has endorsed Sanders, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/danny-devito-talks-voting-bernie-sanders-isla-vista-in-the-sixties/\" target=\"_blank\">drew</a> hundreds of UCSB students to The Arbor for several hours last week, telling them it was important to vote in the California Democratic primary on June 7.</p>\n<p>People planning to see Sanders at SBCC should not bring bags, signs or banners and should limit belongings to small items like keys and phones, the candidate’s campaign said.</p>\n<p>After speaking at SBCC, Sanders will head 60 miles north to address supporters at Santa Maria High School’s Wilson Stadium.

Team</em></p></div>\n<p>A second-year UC Santa Barbara student passed away Friday in a hospital after attempting to take his own life two days before.</p>\n<p>Hayden Werner, pre-biology major and honors student, was actively involved in the Snow Team during his time at UCSB and was set to lead the group as an officer next year.</p>\n<p>Shoshana Cohen, recent UCSB graduate, was Werner’s teammate and said she saw him as a “little brother,” watching him transition through his first and second year of college.</p>\n<p>“He went from an average skier … into a skier who really put it upon himself to go up to Mammoth [Mountain] and make it his life in the winter,” Cohen said. By his second year, she said Werner was a “top part of the team.”</p>\n<p>Along with other members of the team, Cohen and Werner would frequently drive up to Mammoth Mountain for skiing and snowboarding excursions. These trips created memories to last a lifetime, Cohen said, and made their friendship of two years feel like much longer.</p>\n<p>“For me, the favorite parts were the car rides up to Mammoth,” she said. “Just being in that car, and freestyle rapping up the 395, the entire way … it wouldn’t matter how late we got to Mammoth.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said Werner’s friends came together in Isla Vista after his passing to heal and celebrate his life, finding closure by remembering his influence upon their lives.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing that Hayden taught me was to have gratitude and to really recognize all the beauty that surrounds you in life,” Cohen said. “It’s not like I’m moving on, I’m moving forward.

By the end of the evening, the surfaces of the paper lanterns were covered with pictures, songs and simple words such as “I.V. Strong.”</p>\n<p>The memorial events were smaller this year than last, allowing students to address the anniversary and heal in personal ways.</p>\n<p>“I think people just want a space — a space to heal and space to just do whatever they want that is going to benefit them the best — rather than having an organized official event,” Madeline Berger, third-year art and theater double major and student leader for the “Blunite” memorial, said.</p>\n<p>She said the canvases celebrated the life of each student and allowed visitors to acknowledge loss, even if they did not personally know the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think having dedicated spaces like the canvases really do make it a little more connected to each individual that we lost, but … there is no reason you have to connect yourself to exactly one victim,” Berger said. “There [were] tons of people that got hurt, got injured, got shot but recovered … but it was still a part of our community and it still happened to them.”</p>\n<p>Berger described the media attention from last year’s memorial as “overwhelming” and said this year’s gathering was just as special. She believes future anniversaries will be more “private and personal” as the community learns to heal over the passing years.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of the feelings that I’ve been getting from people are just, ‘I need to be able to express it however I am going to express it,’” Berger said. “There doesn’t need to be something big or grand … it can be something as simple as making tea light bags.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

McLane Brown / Daily Nexus </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>Seventy-five dancers, each barefoot, dressed in all white and carrying a simple white terracotta plate performed a ritualistic dance in Storke Plaza on Monday to celebrate peace and to mark the second anniversary of the May 23, 2014, shooting.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Department of Theater and Dance, in conjunction with the Buglisi Dance Theatre of New York, performed the “Table of Silence Project,” a dance originally choreographed by Jacqulyn Buglisi, director of the Buglisi Dance Theatre. The hour-long ceremony was first performed at the Lincoln Center on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>The ritual honored the lives of Weihan Wang, Cheng Hong, George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Veronika Weiss and Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and simultaneously acted as a call and celebration for peace and unity.</p>\n<p>The dancers moved in unison along circular patterns reminiscent of a mandala and culminated the ritual in a minute of silence, seated in concentric circles and their arms outstretched, palms facing up to the sky.</p>\n<p>“Today we stop and remember these six students and celebrate their beautiful lives,” Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in his opening statement.</p>\n<p>To memorialize the lives and contributions of the six students, Chancellor Yang presented six scholarships to current UCSB students prior to the Table of Silence performance. The student recipients were Lindsey Choate, Jennie Christensen, Aileen Fullchange, Joshua Ortiz, Taylor J. Stolzfus and Michael Teller.</p>\n<p>“Each of these recipients reflects the character, passions, kindness, intelligence and ambition of the six students we lost, ensuring that they will always live on in UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said. “They are true leaders who have shown a deep commitment to their education and their community.”</p>\n<p>According to Buglisi, the choreographer of the ritual, the dancers descended upon the plaza “forming patterns of concentric circles to create a Peace Labyrinth, seen as in ancient times.”</p>\n<p>“As they form the Peace Labyrinth, they will bring out the mandala energy, symbolizing the eternity, purity and continuity of the life cycle,” Buglisi said. “Creating a ritual honoring our natural world around us, for peace and harmony.”</p>\n<p>Patrick Lindley, principal musician of UCSB Theater and Dance, was the musical director for the Table of Silence Project. The dancers performed in collaboration with Azeem Ward on flute, William Pasley and Russ Glick on percussion, Emiliano Campobello on flute and conch shell, Margo Halstead on carillon and vocals provided by UCSB’s a cappella group Naked Voices.</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, UCSB’s Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani addressed those who passed away in remembrance.</p>\n<p>“We feel, we hope, we trust that your souls are at peace,” Bhavnani said. “We will always remember you. Fiat lux, let there be light.”</p>\n<p><em>[Update May 24, 2:00 p.m. : This article has been updated to include a full list of performers.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/","id":2486,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[2485,2484,2483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Open to Latino Students’ Demands","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/El-Centro-5-23-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/El-Centro-5-23-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"High-ranking university officials sat with students in El Centro for hours, going point-by-point through a list of demands made by Latino UC Santa Barbara students.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Several high-ranking university officials including Chancellor Henry T.

Following the afternoon discussion in El Centro, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said UCSB was making the group’s demands a high priority.</p>\n<p>“I think you can tell that we’re taking this seriously because you have a lot of university leadership here today and yesterday,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning that more than a quarter of its students are Hispanic. Currently, 27 percent of UCSB students report that they are Hispanic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“These reforms are for the 27 percent here to keep that 27 percent here,” said Jasmine Ortiz, first-year environmental studies major. “We already struggle coming from our communities to get here and then we have to struggle twice as hard to maintain our positions here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sit-down in El Centro, a building near the library that serves as a meeting place for several Latino student-advocacy groups, was direct and productive, with Marisela Márquez, the executive director of Associated Students, serving as a mediator between administrators and students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrators largely seemed open to the students’ demands, at one point remarking that none of VOCEROS’ requests seemed impossible. As the group went through the list, Márquez asked that administrators list barriers to completing the demands as well as solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often, administrators said time and money are the main barriers hindering the completion of VOCEROS’ demands. For example, Maria Herrera-Sobek, the associate vice chancellor for diversity, equity and academic policy, said she was instrumental in creating a Chicano Department at UC Irvine, but that it took more than 15 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“It does take some time, but it is not impossible,” Herrera-Sobek said of creating a Central American major and department at UCSB. “You can start right away by having a committee of students and faculty and administrators exploring and identifying the courses that are out there already” that could fulfill the proposed major’s requirements.</span></p>\n<p>Garcia said there is a need for a Central America-specific department and major because Hispanic spaces on campus often focus on Mexican-Americans.</p>\n<p>“Within the Latinx community, we want to break the barriers between communities,” Garcia said, using a term designed to include Latino and Latina students and Hispanic students who do not identify within traditional gender roles.</p>\n<p>“Students feel like the Chicano Department and a lot of the other resources we have are very Mexican-centric,” Garcia said. “We’re not trying to pit departments against each other or trying to get resources from another department, but more-so trying to expand what we already have and be that 100 percent that we want to be.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the groups’ most feasible demands, according to administrators, is the institution of a Latinx Parents Weekend. Klawunn said she would work to add some of the proposed changes into the fall parents weekend, such as bilingual events and workshops oriented toward Latino parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VOCEROS also had multiple demands relating to campus buildings. The group asked for a guarantee that El Centro would remain a permanent space for Latinx students and also requested that an existing building in Manzanita Village be designated for Latinx students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc Fisher, a vice chancellor, said the university only plans to make routine modifications to the El Centro building over the next few decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can look out 5 or 10 or even 20 years and I can see what the next buildings are, and there are no plans for this site,” Fisher said.</span></p>\n<p>Administrators also responded in favor of dedicating an existing building in Manzanita Village to Latinx students. While housing is already determined for next year, Klawunn said, there could be a Latinx-specific building by fall 2017.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that while it can be “hard to build community” in Manzanita Village as opposed to the standard freshman dorms like Anacapa or San Nicolas, he didn’t think there would be much resistance to the Manzanita Village idea if that is what students desire.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB Police Chief Dustin Olson also attended the meeting, promising to meet with students and possibly other local police agencies by fall to discuss reducing the “footprint” of law enforcement at events like Deltopia or during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Olson also said the department will “definitely be committed and continue to be committed to sensitivity to gender and diversity” in hiring practices.</p>\n<p>Both students and administrators were willing to work with each other and appeared relieved by the productive nature of the talks.</p>\n<p>“It’s Saturday, we should be relaxing … but I’m here meeting with you all and that’s because these things are very important and these are things that affect people’s lives,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“At other UCs you have to literally protest for days just to get [the administrators’] attention,” she continued. “So the fact that we didn’t have to do that is a blessing in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>The full list of VOCEROS demands is available as part of the group’s <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/chancellor-henry-yang-voceros-reforms?recruiter=308498257&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink\">online petition to Chancellor Yang.</a></p>\n<p><em>[Correction, May 23: An initial version of this article said students met with administrators in El Centro for three hours on Saturday.

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>A guest speaker for the UCSB Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) on Wednesday spoke against commonly held beliefs regarding sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Guest Speaker Andrew Cavarno, a fourth-year history major and member of Young Americans for Liberty, argued that a frequently referenced statistic of one in four women being sexually assaulted on college campuses is heavily inflated and lacking in evidence.</p>\n<p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses,” Cavarno said. “The word epidemic implies that there’s a sudden wave of sexual violence, or that things are getting worse – this is just not the case.”</p>\n<p>YAL originally intended the event to be a panel discussion featuring speakers from differing sides of the argument. Pointing to an empty chair beside him, Cavarno emphasized that no one with an opposing view was present to make the case for the statistic, even after having sent out “hundreds of emails.”</p>\n<p>“Why is that chair empty?” Cavarno asked, “If all the evidence is truly on that side, if it is beyond reproach, if there’s no reason to debate this, then why is this chair empty?”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that while sexual assault on campuses is an important issue, the current system infringes upon due process rights.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of the numbers, we still have to have a system that works,” Cavarno said. “Regardless of whether its one in five or one in 50, we still need a system that allows survivors to receive support but also a system that does not infringe on the due process rights of accused students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses.” — Andrew Cavarno</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cavarno criticized a study conducted by the Association of American Universities, stating that it had a sample with an “extraordinarily low response rate” and an “over-broad definition of sexual assault.” He also argued that the study does not distinguish between acts of sexual assault and acts of sexual battery.</p>\n<p>“Both sexual assault and sexual battery are inexcusable, but they are not the same kind of action,” Cavarno said. “The one in five statistic on the other hand uses definitions that fail to distinguish between a girl getting her ass grabbed at a party and being forcibly penetrated, or having someone have sex with her when she is incapacitated.”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that the way schools handle sexual assault often ruins the careers and social lives of men by unfairly branding them as rapists. Cavarno then wrapped up his speech saying “feminism teaches the notion that men are not deserving of empathy,” concluding that “schools should not adjudicate sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>James Cornell, fourth-year electrical engineering major and Vice President of Young Americans for Liberty, said the speech was “very factual and academic.”</p>\n<p>“I think [the statistic] paints a very bad image of males in society and males on college campuses,” Cornell said. “It instills a lot of fear into women so they don’t feel safe on college campuses where they should be.”</p>\n<p>Katia Stern, a second-year financial math and statistics major, said that inflated statistics devalue the instances of more heinous cases of rape.</p>\n<p>“I think if the statistic is over-exaggerated it sort of devalues the worst cases of the rape, and it makes it seem like it’s a lot more prevalent and we start to consider really minor accusations in the compass of the broader definition of rape,” Stern said. “It kind of diminishes the value of individuals who are brutally raped.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a first-year anthropology major, who asked to remain anonymous, said universities should support victims of  sexual assault by providing programs like Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (CARE) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that it’s wrong for universities to be involved in advocating for victims of sexual assault,” she said. “I was sexually assaulted as a minor and I feel like the system that I had before university has utterly failed me, and I feel like it’s very important to have CARE and CAPs and for this university to be very strict on people who are accused.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71213\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71213\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/","id":2483,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2482,2481,2480],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":90,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
