The ballot measure will be on Isla Vistans’ June 5, 2018, primary election ballot.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD was created on Nov. 9, 2016, after the passage of Measure E with an overwhelming 87 percent of the vote, but the new government was deprived of financial stability when Measure F failed to garner the necessary 66.67 percent of the vote, falling short by about six percent.</p>\n<p>Measure R is essentially a second attempt to pass a user utility tax (UUT), the same goal Measure F sought to accomplish in 2016. The ballot language for the measure has changed since the UUT’s first appearance at the polls, though only slightly.</p>\n<p>While on the 2016 ballot, Measure F included the contingency that the UUT would go into effect with the creation of a then-nebulous CSD. Measure R now lists the particular services the tax would fund.</p>\n<p>According to the ballot language registered with the county’s clerk-recorder, the UUT would explicitly fund any of the following services: improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>The tax could also be used to provide tenant mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate facilities like the Community Room the CSD currently meets at for its twice-monthly board meetings and the burgeoning Community Center.</p>\n<p>In order to place Measure R on the June primary ballot, the CSD Board of Directors first voted on the language citizens would see on their voting slips and then submitted the proposed question to the County of Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which later approved the phrasing at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the CSD has found its organizational framework, hired legal counsel, expanded the Community Service Organization’s escort services, piloted a tenant mediation program with the Santa Barbara Legal Aid Foundation and hired an interim General Manager, all while operating mainly on a $200,000 donation from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand said the key difference between the 2016 vote and this year’s is that the CSD has found its footing, proving it can do a lot with a little.</p>\n<p>Support for Measure R is mounting within student activist networks and some government circles. UC Santa Barbara’s Campus Democrats began campaigning for the measure last Monday, while the “Yes on Measure R” campaign has been active since mid-March.</p>\n<p>While the I.V. Recreation and Parks District has not made an official statement supporting the measure, Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann issued a statement on Wednesday “strongly in support” of Measure R. Hartmann has personally contributed $6,000 toward the campaign and will actively fundraise and canvass for its passage, she said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the measure’s passage would allow for the CSD to thrive and provide effective services to its unique demographic.</p>\n<p>“Due to its great density, diversity, poverty level, and demographics dominated by a young student population … Isla Vista has an even greater need for services and infrastructure than other unincorporated areas in the County,” Hartmann said in her statement.</p>\n<p>While proponents of the tax have sought to spread their message through door-to-door canvassing and tabling, opponents have voiced their displeasure toward the tax<sub>,</sub> primarily through flyers.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, treasurer of anti-UUT group Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that the group has been distributing flyers advocating for a “no” vote on the measure.</p>\n<p>The flyers claim that I.V. residents’ taxes are far too high and calls on them to voice their dissent. The exact cost of the UUT for individual residents is still undetermined, according to CSD Secretary and Director Spencer Brandt. The CSD plans to present a revenue estimate at their next board meeting, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he is against the measure’s passage because he believes the I.V. government does not need additional funding “to do what they have already done.” He also said services like tenant mediation duplicate already available services like the Community Housing Office and other resources offered by UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

recital and art exhibition on Thursday. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez </em></p></div>\n<p>For the first time at UC Santa Barbara, indigenous writers, poets and scholars gathered for “A Verbal Kaleidoscope,” a conference aiming to challenge how indigenous literature and practices are studied in Western academia by presenting modern-day indigenous literary movements.</p>\n<p>Throughout eight sessions across two days, the Spanish and Portuguese department brought together Juan Gregorio Regino, director of Mexico’s National Institute of Indigenous Languages, native Zapotec and Mazatec writers and local community members to discuss contemporary and ancestral indigenous peoples’ literary perspectives.</p>\n<p>The conference, which ran through April 4 and 5, started with a singing ceremony by local Chumash tribal members acknowledging and respecting the tribe’s history and life in their land in the nearby area.</p>\n<p>A majority of the discussions were held in Spanish and the poetry recital held at the Art, Design and Architecture Museum was translated from the native languages such as Irma Pineda Santiago’s poems in Zapotec.</p>\n<p>“We were very surprised by the caliber of the presentations,” Osiris Gómez, Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Literature and conference organizer said.</p>\n<p>Gómez previously said organizers wanted to break traditional conference dynamics by creating a more fluid conversation and feels they were able to accomplish that goal, but believes there is still room to grow when exploring indigenous literature in academia.</p>\n<p>“It was an amazing experience to be able to bring together writers and scholars in this level, especially people from all over the country and abroad,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>Gómez was impressed with the speakers’ keynote presentations and said they opened up the conversation for other speakers to participate and break out of the one-way conversation that presentations often create.</p>\n<p>He appreciated the speakers’ creativity in using their own literary work for their responses, such as when Juan Gregorio Regino started reading from his poetry to answer the questions from the moderator.</p>\n<p>“That’s when we really went into the poetic act to explore [the conversation],” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>At a later panel during the conference, Regino spoke about “revolutionizing modern literature,” claiming that what indigenous scholars are doing with their work is of the most contemporary literature in the world today.</p>\n<p>“La poesía lingüísticamente es una reconstrucción de la propia lengua,” Regino said, meaning “poetry linguistically reconstructs language.”</p>\n<p>He continued by saying that creating poetry with native languages indigenous people can get them involved in the world of creating literature.</p>\n<p>Another element of poetry that Regino finds useful for indigenous people is “la afirmación de decir ‘aquí estamos, aqui esta nuestras lenguas, aquí están nuestras escrituras y estamos vivos,’” Regino said, meaning “the affirmation in saying ‘we are here, here are our tongues, here is our literature and we are alive.”</p>\n<p>Regino said the indigenous literary movement is in a transition and that the conference itself has explored ways to see from the outside how the movement is progressing.</p>\n<p>The movement “tiene que transcender el mundo indígena, y solamente así es como cambiamos y vamos a sentir entendidos. Solamente así este movimiento va tener presencia y fuerza,” Regino said, meaning “[the movement] has to transcend outside of the indigenous world and only then will we feel understood and have presence and strength.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82342\" data-attachment-id=\"82342\"

giving the language a linguistically poetic aspect. <em>Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>Cherrie Moraga, award-winning author for This Bridge Called My Back and newly-hired English professor, spoke during the first session titled “Beyond Aztlan: New Nahua Perspectives.” Her talk, “Throwing Shade to the West,” presented a Xicana indigena point of view within literature and academia.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Moraga pointed out the long history of colonization of indigenous people and how traditional language departments were “generated from a very eurocentric perspective.”</p>\n<p>Moraga applauded the Spanish department for hosting a conference on subjects typically only covered in the field of anthropology.</p>\n<p>“To think that a Spanish department was actually hosting a conference on indigenous languages is an incredible breakthrough,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>“[The conference] speaks to this evolution of consciousness beginning to happen even among sites that traditionally held indigenous thinking and people in disregard,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>Moraga was particularly impressed with the Chumash women who spoke about recovering their own languages through working with non-indigenous anthropologists who have done research and have access to the languages.</p>\n<p>She said she admired them because “having to learn it through them, but then having to make it their own again,” is a challenge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Cabranes-Grant, chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department, asked “Qué tipo de conocimiento nos ofrece la poesía y qué instrumento epistemológico es la poesía?” meaning “What knowledge does poetry offer us and what epistemological instruments does it have?”</p>\n<p>Zapotec poet Irma Pineda Santiago responded by saying that poetry has a broad social function beyond communication and the various genres of the ancestral Zapotec language can particularly allow poetry to go beyond its traditional elements.</p>\n<p>“People were speaking from their creative process and to me, that was amazing, you can only get that type of conversation when you interview an author,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gómez said, if a second version of the conference is possible, they will grow from this one and come up with new conference dynamics. “I think this conference was a great step in bringing a different type of conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gómez noted that in bringing these poets to the conference, one can assume that they are representatives and can speak for their whole community or nation, but Gómez said they were very humble when presenting themselves.</p>\n<p>“They told us ‘this is what I do and this is how I represent my community,’ It was far more nourishing than just having a set of questions and their keynote address,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>“The intent of this conference is to create consciousness and not just about the political aspects of the literature, but I want it to become an invitation for people to actually become acquainted and curious,” Gómez said.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A superior court judge ruled Thursday iV Menus owner Patrick Galoustian will have his preliminary hearing date setting on June 6 as the prosecution obtains further pre-trial evidence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, 45, was arrested in December on four felony charges, including kidnap to commit robbery or rape, rape of a drugged victim and two counts of oral copulation by use of force or injury. He is being held on combined $1.5 million bail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before his arrest, Galoustian owned and operated iV Menus, a popular Isla Vista-based food delivery service, for nine years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday afternoon, Judge Thomas R. Adams announced his decision to postpone Galoustian’s case to June 6, citing five outstanding requests for discovery by the prosecution. In the legal system, discovery is a method that either party can use to obtain more pre-trial evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll get the actual discovery and be ready to rock and roll by the first weekend of June,” Adams told the courtroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After changing attorneys, Galoustian is now represented by Robert Sanger, who served as co-counsel for pop legend Michael Jackson in 2005 when the late idol was tried for child molestation. Galoustian was previously represented by Mindi Boulet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian is a 2003 UC Santa Barbara alumnus. His preliminary setting hearing has been postponed three times after being originally scheduled on Jan. 11. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated April 6, 2:33 p.m.</em></p><div

For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business (F&amp;B) committee voted on Feb. 26 to reallocate an existing fund for a new A.S. Bike Shop building toward a Bike Shop in the University Center (Ucen) instead. In late March, the Office of Budget and Planning provided updated calculations for the UCen fees.</p>\n<p>Students voted to approve a new bike shop building fund back in 2006. The building has never been built and students continue to use the existing Bike Shop building to repair their bicycles.</p>\n<p>F&amp;B Chair Kian Maalizadeh obtained updated calculations of how potential UCen student fees would look.</p>\n<p>With the Bike Shop funding now going toward the UCen renovation, the two student fees for the UCen project would decrease. The fees will be voted upon on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The first $21.42 fee is now $20.40 and will still be in effect from 2018 to 2022. The second $99.61 fee is now $96.06 and students will pay it from 2022 to 2052.</p>\n<p>Both fees will take effect if students vote to pass the UCen project later this month.</p>\n<p>In the 12 years since the fund was created, students have paid the resulting $5.50 quarterly student fee and voted to reaffirm it every two years. The fee has generated over $2 million in revenue in the process, Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>“We have this fee that’s being voted on every two years and that’s just sitting there to be used for a new Bike Shop,” Maalizadeh said. “[The UCen project] is the only plan that’s actually been proposed to use those student fees.”</p>\n<p>After the Bike Shop is built in the UCen, the lock-in fee associated with it would expire. The current Bike Shop building, located next to Parking Lot 29 on campus, would be demolished.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Bike Shop is housed in a 40-year-old cargo container that is “not meant for human occupation,” the official F&amp;B reallocation ballot language reads.</p>\n<p>“There are no bathrooms, the floors are rotting and it is a hazard to the students occupying the space,” the language reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCen fee rises with inflation rates</strong></p>\n<p>While the UCen ballot petition language referred to two successive student fees, the second fee is not fixed. Instead, the fee will climb each year, roughly alongside inflation rates, according to a fee referendum document obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Before the 30-year fee was adjusted for the Bike Shop reallocation, it stood at $99.61. But with inflation rates, the fee rises each year by a rate that ranges between just under 0.7 percent to about 1.17 percent.</p>\n<p>As a result, the $99.61 fee increases to about $129.46 in 2052, the final year the fee would be in effect. That would push the total revenue generated from student fees to a number much higher than the $193 million the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">reported</a> in early March.</p>\n<p>Now, the $99.61 fee has been offset to $96.06, but inflation will still apply to the reduced fee, and the total amount of money raised from student fees will be much higher than $48 million, which is what officials say is the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>It is unclear at this time how exactly the new projected fees would be affected by inflation.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le did not confirm that the new amounts will rise by the same rates because no one has run the numbers yet, he said.</p>\n<p>“Those figures haven’t been calculated yet for these new numbers,” Le said. “But we do know, with this new $2 million in place, what the initial figures are.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inflation estimates inconsistent across fees</strong></p>\n<p>Not many other student fees at UCSB appear to be affected by inflation. For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42.</p>\n<p>The inflated costs are lower than what real inflation rates will look like over the next 34 years, UCSB economics professor Peter Rupert told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“Realistic inflation is going to be more like 2 percent,” said Rupert, who also directs the local Economic Forecast Project. “Right now it’s incredibly low, it’s the lowest it’s ever been.”</p>\n<p>The UCen renovation, dubbed the “NewCen” initiative, was first proposed by Le in January. It would provide expanded office space to student services like Food Bank, Counseling and Psychological Services and Campus Learning Assistance Services. In addition, a renovated UCen would provide a 24/7 study space and a campus pub.</p>\n<p>With the F&amp;B’s reallocation, the finished UCen will also include a new A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Students can vote to approve the initiative with 50 percent plus one “yes” vote on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the

The dosage of Misoprostol was also changed from 2 tablets (400 mcg) to 4 tablets (800 mcg).</p>\n<p>“[People] argued that the FDA were missing instances [in their review of the drug] where patients might have died because they were not using one of the [proper] monitoring systems that monitor the safety of drugs,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel System is the monitoring system used by the FDA to determine the safety of medicine by analyzing health information made available by physicians online, according to the FDA website.</p>\n<p>After an investigation of the FDA’s approval of changes, the GAO found that the attacks by the critics against the proper use of the Sentinel System were invalid because the Sentinel System applies only to drugs distributed through pharmacies.</p>\n<p>“MifePrex is not distributed through pharmacies so information on it would not be available in the Sentinel System to allow it to track safety concerns,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>Mifeprex does have another mechanism to track its safety concerns, and Crosse confirmed that Mifeprex has a low rate of serious medical events that occurred as a result of women taking the drug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An original version of this article stated that SB 320 will allow all public universities to provide the abortion pill.

Their request to the county to use the Solar Lot on Embarcadero Del Mar as alternative parking was also rejected.</p>\n<p>CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said after identifying that the university was financially responsible for the fencing on El Colegio Road as opposed to the Santa Barbara County, the board put in a request with the university to avoid putting up fencing in response to the demands of the community.</p>\n<p>“We put in the request and essentially never heard back,” Brandt said. “A couple of us, myself included, feel very disillusioned by the fact that the university is not willing to listen to a bunch of concerned community members.”</p>\n<p>University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said fencing had been installed on El Colegio Road despite the motion that the CSD passed.</p>\n<p>“In the interest of public safety and traffic concerns, and in consultation with county officials and law enforcement, the decision was made to once again use the fencing during the weekend,” Estrada said when asked why the CSD’s request was denied.</p>\n<p>University Board appointee George Thurlow referenced two incidents in Santa Barbara in which pedestrians were killed in car accidents while jaywalking to explain why the university and UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) chief of police were adamant about installing the fences.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the discussion, it was concluded that that fence needed to be there, and if it saves one life, then it was worth it,” Thurlow said.</p>\n<p>The board had previously contacted the university to ask about the cost of fencing and were only told that it was a “substantial amount of money,” according to Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes the university is keeping the figure under wraps because the high price tag would upset residents who already oppose the fencing.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s disheartening because we do a lot of work to try to change the character of these events and make them so they are more community-based so that they are something that is safe for all community members,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said there are better alternatives the university could promote, such as UCIV, a student-run volunteer program that has been developed in the past three years.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes UCIV would be able to “ensure that the event is safe on a peer-to-peer level in a way that law enforcement has failed to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a volunteer program just spring up out of nowhere, totally student-led, that really wants to try to dull down the number of people that are interacting with law enforcement, that are being arrested and being cited,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt also spoke about the importance of peer-to-peer relationships between students and CSOs, saying he felt the motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station during Deltopia is a positive step.</p>\n<p>He said he believes it’s important for the CSOs to be the “eyes and ears” of the community during events like this, when residents might not feel comfortable approaching law enforcement personnel with critical information.</p>\n<p>Plans regarding the creation of alternative parking for residents living on Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road and Trigo Road were halted after the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department rejected the board’s request to use the Pardall Solar Parking Lot, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He also said the County was “concerned about the loss of revenue” if the parking lot was used by residents of impacted streets for free.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said the board was working with Transportation &amp; Parking Services in order to create alternative parking, particularly with concerns for students who use their cars to get to their jobs.</p>\n<p>Originally, it was assumed that only Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road would have restricted parking. Brandt then found out on April 4 that parking on Trigo Road would also be controlled and that parking would not be permitted within 100 feet of the barricades.</p>\n<p>“There’s certain areas where we put no parking, like Trigo Road. The vehicles there will get towed because that street is going to get shut down,” Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Lieutenant Juan Camarena said. “Everywhere else our recommendation is not to park, but if you park we’re not going to tow it like last year.”</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the city of Goleta, all vehicles in the area from Hollister Ave. to the southern city limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road without an approved permit will be subjected to a ticket. Parking lots on campus will also be restricted. Daytime parking will only be available for vehicles with the appropriate permits visible; vehicles parked on campus overnight without proper authorization will be impounded and given a $300 fine.</p>\n<p>Both Lieutenants Camarena and David Millard of UCPD attended the Deltopia town hall last month. At the town hall, Lieutenant Camarena said the UCPD and IVFP planned to closely monitor social media and adjust the amount of law enforcement present during Deltopia accordingly.</p>\n<p>Millard and Camarena said that they were not aware of any such monitoring when asked about efforts regarding plans to observe social media platforms for any posts related to Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say that I actually even heard that they were doing it this year,” Millard said.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP currently have no plans to adjust the projected level of police presence during Deltopia, regardless of the weather, according to IVFP Deputy James McKarrel.</p>\n<p>“Rain or shine we will be staffed because it’s easier for us to reduce our units if we don’t need them then to bring them in if we do need them,” McKarrel said.</p>\n<p>Camarena estimated that there may be “around 60 to 70 officers” out during Deltopia, but could not give an exact number.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be similar to last year,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p>Millard also could not give an exact number of officers and said the department won’t know how many they will deploy until the day of the event because “officers may get sick or have family emergencies.”</p>\n<p>Camarena also said IVFP would not bring in horses during Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year as a lieutenant for Deltopia, and the whole thing for me is just another day for us,” he said. “We just need to make sure that people are safe.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Taxpayers from each zone provide the funding, which the governments then distribute to libraries in the county. While the amount of funding remains unchanged after the vote, Isla Vista will now provide a larger percentage of the funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. government leaders support the rezoning and believe it could be a step toward a “bookmobile” and a small, permanent library in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County currently gives the library $7.80 of per-capita funding from each resident of unincorporated areas. Since I.V. is an unincorporated area, its residents generate approximately $180,000 of per-capita funding annually.</p>\n<p>The new zone will include Isla Vista, Buellton, Solvang, Eastern Goleta Valley, Community Service Area 3 and Hope Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Library currently belongs to Zone 1, which is run by the City of Santa Barbara and encompasses Eastside Library, Goleta, Montecito, Carpinteria, Buellton and Solvang.</p>\n<p>Gina Fischer, district representative for Supervisor Joan Hartmann, said she is hopeful the board’s vote will better help the City of Goleta serve I.V. residents — including students, children and families. Hartmann, who represents I.V. as Third County Supervisor, voted in favor of the rezoning at the Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>Currently, any resident of Santa Barbara County can obtain a free library card at any branch as part of a “cooperative network,” a resource Fischer said many students are unaware of.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand expressed his support for the rezoning during the board of supervisors’ April 3 meeting. The CSD directors are hopeful that Zone 4’s creation will benefit the residents of Isla Vista, as they will now have a larger stake in the services by paying for more of the funding.</p>\n<p>The CSD and the City of Goleta have proposed the creation of a “bookmobile” that would travel from the Camino Real Marketplace through I.V. They also spoke about the eventual installment of a small, permanent library.</p>\n<p>Director Spencer Brandt spoke optimistically about these ideas, calling them “a step in the right direction” toward providing I.V. residents the services they deserve considering the funds they would provide.</p>\n<p>Brandt added that there is not much leverage over how the county’s money is spent and hopes the rezoning will open doors.</p>\n<p>“We need to work towards library services that are based full-time out of Isla Vista and are tailored to our unique community needs,” he said.</p>\n<p>CSD director and county appointee Bob Geis also spoke of the lack of library services in the community, as well as the difficulty of accessing the Goleta Library for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>For residents to reach the library, which is fairly inaccessible by public transportation, it would require walking past Fairview, across the freeway overpass, from the nearest bus stop.</p>\n<p>Both Brandt and Geis are hopeful that bringing library services closer to I.V. will take place in the future, as it is a stepping stone in ensuring the funds allocated maximize services for residents.</p>\n<p>“I’m very supportive of the effort to move towards mobile library services, and think it is the first step towards even bigger and better things, and towards a funding allocation model that makes sure the money generated in Isla Vista is being spent on services in Isla Vista,” Brandt said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Currently, the machine is the only bitcoin ATM in Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss co-founded the bitcoin ATM company Coind LLC with a hometown friend. They funded the startup costs themselves, confident that the ATMs would provide a steady cash flow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has proven noticeable. I.V. Deli Mart customers frequently stop to examine it, mostly out of curiosity, said Deli Mart owner Michael Hassan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people come in and look at it and say, ‘Oh look, bitcoin!’” Hassan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not too many I.V. residents have actually bought in. Blaufuss estimated the machine gets about two to three purchases a day — each worth about $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its invention in 2009, bitcoin’s popularity has steadily climbed through internet word-of-mouth. Its major selling point is that transactions are encrypted and decentralized, which means it can’t be easily stolen and central banks can’t track the exchanges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATMs provide another platform for people to obtain the currency, complementing online exchanges like Coinbase. The ATM in I.V. allows only purchases; withdrawals must be carried out online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is valued at more than $7,000 per coin as of Saturday, but the amount is strikingly volatile and can sharply rise or decline from day to day. The currency is so speculative that even a single piece of bad news can lead to bitcoin owners dumping and ditching their share of the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just the past four months, the value has plummeted from a </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-warnings-grow-louder-idUSKBN1E919T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record high</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of nearly $18,000, after news broke that foreign governments are attempting to </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/bitcoin-drops-more-than-14-percent-to-below-7000.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add regulations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cryptocurrency transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Blaufuss has sold all of his bitcoins, though he noted that the value may rebound just as quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The market right now is just trash,” he said. “Everything is in the gutter. I’ve sold everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But it’s a good time to buy right now, because everything is so cheap,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ATMs have picked up steam after a slow start, said James Forshaw, Blaufuss’ friend and company co-founder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“College students are a lot more aware of bitcoin and how to use it,” Forshaw said. He and Blaufuss have set up another ATM in Agoura Hills and plan to place one in Oxnard in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATM customers don’t have to buy one whole coin every time — since the currency is digital, it can be broken down into fractional amounts that run as many as eight decimal places.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters laud the currency as a future competition to the dollar, given how little encryption and how much oversight currently exists for dollar transactions.
