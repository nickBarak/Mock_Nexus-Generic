Recreation &amp; Park District building, and was a guest speaker at various UC Santa Barbara classes — was remembered as “the type of person to respect all people, regardless of who they were,” said Marcelino Sepulveda, a friend of Bean’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He touched many generations of people, and that is represented here today. Today is an opportunity for the greater community to honor Michael for who he was and what he gave us,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees spoke of Bean’s talent for bringing together generations; UCSB students and permanent Isla Vista residents alike touted his dedication to the community around him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had an uncanny ability to see past age and see the person instead, which made people of all ages enjoy his company and want to spend more time with him,” one tearful community member explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean’s commitment to the environment was “unparalleled,” they added. Bean often biked through the streets of I.V. collecting trash and was a strong proponent for a community forest to feed food-insecure community members, the community member said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean was also an active member of the spiritual group Diamond Heart, as several mentioned at the memorial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our group sessions, we would share personal information that was often very difficult to say. Michael would always be there with a kind word, to listen and in turn share his personal stories,” according to one speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to members of Bean’s various community groups, UCSB students also found inspiration in Bean’s dedication to an environmental community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would often read together,” Ash Vincent, a UCSB environmental studies and feminist studies major, said. “He was always interested in what me or any other people were reading, and I thought sharing that shows how he was always interested and always learning new ways he could be useful to the community. I think he was underappreciated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many, including Vincent, left memorial attendees with concrete ways to honor Bean’s legacy. In addition to a petition to dedicate the Free Box to Bean, Vincent encouraged attendees to email him for a copy of an Ecovista source book that Bean wrote before his death.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student — Bean’s neighbor and an environmental studies major, who remained unnamed — acknowledged his uncommon relationship with Bean, who he met in UCSB Professor John Foran’s sociology class Earth in Crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had a very special connection to this place, and I got to see him try and better himself and our community… seeing him biking around and coming home to him feeding the scrub jays in our yard was a really special moment for me, and I’ve been doing my best to feed them for him,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sepulveda, who helped organize the celebration of life, asked attendees to take wildflower seeds and spread them around I.V. following the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We invite you to take these and disperse them, so that his spirit may grow and blossom amongst the flowers here,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the 3rd District supervisor seat saw a close start between incumbent Joan Hartmann, a registered Democrat and challenger Bruce Porter, who ran with no party in the recent election. The vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results showed Hartmann and Porter nearly tied, with 43.79% and 43.34% of the vote, respectively. Karen Jones lagged behind, with 7.78% of the vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that as a general rule, Republicans and conservatives vote early and vote by mail. So the fact that I was not behind was a very good [start] for the rest of the [race],” Hartmann said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the early tie, Porter said, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were deeply gratified and honored by the support we’ve received in early results. We believe that our message of Independence and commitment to bringing a new voice to all residents resonated deeply with voters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night went on and precincts began reporting results, Hartmann gained a strong lead as Porter began to fall behind. With 21 of the 49 precincts reporting as of midnight on March 4, Hartmann had 51.77% of the vote, Porter had 35.81% and Jones followed with 6.8%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the county released the semi-official results, Hartmann maintained her lead with 52.26% of the vote, while Porter stayed behind with 35.71%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the official certified results are released by the Santa Barbara County Elections Division, there is the possibility of the vote continuing to the November general election. For Hartmann to clinch the 3rd District supervisor seat, she must receive 50% plus one of the votes in the primary election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With over 30,000 ballots still to be tallied county-wide, it’s too soon to draw any definite conclusions from the current totals,” Porter said in a statement courtesy of Mathew Burciaga, Porter’s communications director. “The Porter for Supervisor campaign is looking forward to seeing the final results and is preparing for a lively general election in November.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the State Assembly seat of the 37th District started and ended with an unwavering  lead, held by lone Republican Charles Cole, who started off with 36.27% of the vote of the vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City Mayor Cathy Murillo followed with 22.44% of the vote, Steve Bennett with 16.82% and Jason Dominguez with 8.68%. Elsa Granados had 5.81% of the vote, Jonathan Abboud had 5.75% and Stephen Blum had 3.89%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all precincts reporting, Cole ended the night with 32.15% of the vote. Abboud, general manager of the Isla Vista Community Services District and longtime resident of I.V., fell behind with 6.89% of the semi-final vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re proud of our campaign staff and volunteers and supporters for running a really strong campaign,” Abboud said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we probably did not make the runoff, I’m not going to stop advocating for and working on the issues I ran on, that no other candidate did, like tuition-free public college, the Green New Deal to combat climate change and inequality and affordable housing … The campaign was always about the issues that were not being talked about, not about me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann supported Abboud’s campaign and echoed his sentiments for future plans. “Working with communities to identify their goals and then developing strategies to accomplish those goals. So for I.V. maybe a Green New Deal, you know, how do we bring that about?” Hartmann said. “How do we clearly get better quality housing in I.V. and get the university to build the housing?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the race for State Senator of the 19th District, Democrat Monique Limón and Republican Gary Michaels advanced to a runoff in the November general election, with 56.4% and 38.09% of the vote, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in the race for House Representative of the 24th District, Democrat Salud Carbajal and Republican Andy Caldwell will also advance to a runoff.

Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V. Co-op and the UCSB Sustainability to ensure everything is running smoothly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also check in and receive feedback from other leaders on campus like the Middle Eastern Resource Center, and the Muslim Student Association for new ideas and to see how we can improve or better serve our joint Muslim and Jewish Community,” Shahaf added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Shahaf, the importance of the program extends beyond its day-to-day operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Keeping Kosher is how I keep my ancestors and my cultural past close to my heart, and it is one of the only aspects of Judaism in my daily life,” she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I imagine it is similar for many Muslim students who keep Halal, as they are reminded of Islamic persecution around the world. I want to make it possible for every Jewish and Muslim student to keep their religious dietary restrictions, and to feel seen and supported by this campus.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

For the leasing aspect of the website, prospective tenants can review topics such as landlord responsiveness and timely repairs, as well as general experiences in renting from the landlord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move-out section will allow tenants to say whether their landlord set clear expectations for the move-out, such as whether or not the prospective tenant is expected to hire an outside cleaning company, according to Menzhausen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The renter will also be able to choose whether or not they would recommend their landlord to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s almost like when you sign up for classes, right, with RateMyProfessor, you want to know what you’re getting into,” Menzhausen said. “The syllabus may not encompass everything that’s actually going to happen.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landlords will be able to respond to what their tenants post about them, but renter posts themselves will be anonymous in order to prevent possible retaliation, according to Lieberman. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some landlords have expressed concerns over how renters might use the website, especially if it is based on anonymous reviews. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t usually say anything [on review websites] unless they’re upset,” said Michelle Roberson, president of Sierra Property Management. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When they’re trying to get leverage over a situation, that’s when they go on there to make things go their way.

While on strike, UCSB graduate students who work as teaching assistants will withhold Winter 2020 grades and will not hold any sections or do any work unrelated to their own degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large number of graduate students, undergraduates and faculty returned for the second day of the strike, with upwards of 300 showing up for day two of the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s graduate students are from the second campus within the UC system to go on strike in the fight for a COLA; UC Santa Cruz graduate students are on their 13th day on the picket line, and UC Davis recently announced that they will be withholding grades starting yesterday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every UC campus — except for UC San Francisco — has taken some form of organizing action for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike at UCSB began at 8 a.m. and continued until 5 p.m., with a rally at noon where close to 1,600 people filled the Storke Tower lawn. The crowd heard from various organizers, faculty and undergraduates before marching across bike lanes, through the Arbor and to the Mosher Alumni House parking lot. On the way back to Storke Tower, a crowd formed a circle around the University Library, continuing to chant while other speakers spoke.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor and interim chair in the department of Asian American studies, said to the crowd at the rally that the university needs to be more seriously addressing COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Thomas Fires hit, this university took extraordinary measures — finals were moved to another quarter. This, I say, is an extraordinary moment. Graduate students on average spend over 50% of their income on rent. This is untenable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Student Association (GSA) President Cierra Sorin said that the high turnout for the first day of the strike was unexpected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not gonna lie, I was scared getting up this morning. I didn’t sleep a whole lot last night; this is a big thing that we’re doing. But people came through,” Sorin said. “Every constituency on campus, I think, came through today, especially the undergrads — there were hundreds of undergrads that came out. I’m in awe.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday morning began with approximately 20 people, but by 11 a.m., that number grew to over 100, which grew to over 1,000 by noon. A large part of that crowd included undergraduates and faculty who stood in solidarity with graduate students throughout the day; more than 50 S.T.E.M. students also had their own separate march from the Chemistry Lawn before merging into the larger rally at Storke Tower. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, about 80 faculty members across different departments — all wearing black and several wearing graduation regalia — met at Cheadle Hall and delivered their own demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, emphasizing that they believe there should be no retaliation against students or faculty for participating in COLA organizing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History professor Ann Marie Plane, who was one of the professors that delivered the demands, said in an interview that it was a “cordial meeting” but noted that administration and graduate students may have a hard time coming to an agreement over a COLA without “significant intervention, either by the university administration in Oakland, and/or the state legislature coming up with more funds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t recruit top quality graduate students without some kind of augmentation. Absolutely we’re going to lose students, lose the international quality and character of the institution,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Marshall said “it would be most appropriate to take this struggle to Sacramento,” referring to the California legislature, since he estimates it would be around $40 to $50 million to meet UCSB’s COLA estimates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marshall added that because the strike is happening without the authorization of the graduate student union, United Auto Workers Union 2865, it is the “official line of the Office of the President” that it is “illegal for the university to negotiate with the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local political leaders also stood in solidarity with graduate students during the strike, including Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who is running for re-election, and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who is running for State Assembly. Karen Jones, who is running against Hartmann for the supervisor seat, also came later in the day in support of COLA and to speak with COLA organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carlos Cruz, a second-year history doctoral student at UCSC who has continued to withhold his classes’ fall quarter grades, came down to Santa Barbara to speak at the strike, emphasizing the importance of UC-wide action in order to get a UC-wide response from UC President Janet Napolitano. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much what it comes down to is, what does solidarity mean? What does solidarity look like? If we’re going to change anything, we have to engage in solidarity,” Cruz said. “Not through the power of institutions, [but through] the power of ourselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the strike continues into next week, Sorin said COLA organizers plan to have more activities during the day, such as teach-ins and lectures about the history of activism and legal observation training as well as social activities, including board games and dance parties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin said that the UCSB COLA movement is looking to capitalize on the large crowds that showed up for Thursday’s rally and turn that into a deeper involvement with the movement as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re having more folks come to us hour by hour being like, ‘What can we do to help, how can I get involved?’ We’re getting people self-assigned to sub-committees, having people continue to show up to meetings,” Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson Guilfoil and Holly Rusch contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang to “email UCSC administration and the UC Office of the President denouncing the threats to terminate wildcat strikers and request[s] that UCOP opens negotiations on a COLA for graduate students at all UC campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in an interview with the Nexus that she feels that the needs of graduate students are sometimes left out in the greater conversation of student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of times on undergraduate UC campuses, a lot of the emphasis is on undergraduate students and resources for them,” she said. “But I think a lot of times, people forget about graduate students and TAs and it’s not as big of a topic, not only on UC campuses, but nationwide.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos, who first learned about the COLA movement after one of her TAs “took the time to educate us on the issue” by holding her class’s section at the 16-hour-long Cheadle Hall </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sit-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Friday, said “it’s insane that [a COLA is] a fight that our grad students have to go through because we feel so blessed to be at this institution, but so many people are struggling to make things stay afloat.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m a student who solely relies on financial aid through UCSB, as well as whatever FAFSA is able to provide me. So I’m just trying to fathom how I would barely be able to scrape by and have a healthy living situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond giving graduate students support from the resolution, White said that Associated Students (A.S.) also paid to reserve Corwin Pavilion for the COLA General Assembly meeting on Monday, where graduate students voted to begin striking on Thursday. In addition, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi said during Senate that the Internal Vice President’s Office will “fund COLA for up to $1,000 for supplies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, a student sponsor on the resolution, was outspoken about the Senate’s lack of engagement with not just the COLA movement but with student activism this year, slamming his fellow senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People continuously come up to me, asking me, ‘Where are the elected representatives that we supposedly look up to?’ With the COLA movement going on, it’s not just enough for a couple of us to be showing up,” Segura said to the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White, who both confirmed they will be present at Thursday’s wildcat strike alongside graduate students, emphasized the need for undergraduate support as a pipeline to create awareness about this issue and to rally the student body to support a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the strike at Santa Cruz started, they did not have a lot of grad students striking. They didn’t have any documentation of faculty support or undergraduate support. I think a really cool part about our [COLA] movement is that we’ve already started to document all this undergraduate and faculty support,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And I think it’s going to be really helpful moving forward in our dealings with administration,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White also made note that although the lifestyles and responsibilities of graduate students are different from those of their undergraduate student counterparts, they are not mutually exclusive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their living conditions are our learning conditions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

They had a garage,” Gerstenberger said. “And the second that I had space was, ‘let’s go buy a piece of equipment and make it happen.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gertsenberger also touched on his eagerness to begin screen-printing, which he said he was drawn to from the beginning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that I could actually see the process of creating a stencil on a mesh with ink and a squeegee and create a final product is, I think, really fascinating.” Ultimately, he said, he “just wanted to have a print shop in a garage just so [he] could make [his] own t-shirts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Gerstenberger built his passion project into a small business, starting with $7,000 in investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “$7,000 is a lot in some mindsets,” he said. But, assuming one order of t-shirts was worth $500, “I could do … 10 jobs or 20 jobs in two years and make my money back.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon enough, he had far more than 20 jobs coming his way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerstenberger recalled working 40 to 50 hours a week at the beginning, which, according to his calculations, was often far less than minimum wage. But the business kept growing, necessitating five moves across Goleta and Santa Barbara in search of bigger spaces to keep up with demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At times, I hoped that there was an electrical fire that happened where we could just be like, ‘bummer, it all burned down and we got to move on,’” he joked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as the company grew, something had to give; in this case, it was Gerstenberger’s economics major, which he dropped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s ironic, because I walked into the econ department saying I’m gonna start a small business … ‘Do you guys have any suggestions?’” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department advised that he “apply the theories” that he learned in his classes. Later, when Gerstenberger returned at wits’ end to ask if he could use his business as the basis of a research project, which would have allowed him to reduce his course load, they turned him down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[They were] like, ‘sorry, we can’t do anything,’” Gerstenberger said. “‘We can’t do independent study,’ like, ‘this is the way it is.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these hardships, Gerstenberger said he lives for what he does.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve learned to realize that the people around me are the most valuable thing I have,” he said, listing customers that range from  PTA moms, to “a random group of people from elementary school” to “a small business here to a medium-sized business there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone needs t-shirts,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular relationship that stuck with Gerstenberger is Jose Cardoso, a fellow screen printer with over 25 years of experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We met when I was in the garage and I didn’t have the experience that I needed to do everything,” Gerstenberger said. “And so I’d send him jobs that I couldn’t do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gerstenberger, the pair quickly settled into their own roles: he the “designer and sales,” and Cardoso the “master printer.” After a year of working together, they decided to join forces for good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trust in other people and … let other people do the things that aren’t your strengths,” Gerstenberger said. “Divide and conquer was something that was important for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Gerstenberger said he is looking to expand operations to universities beyond UCSB and to parts of northern California. More recently, in 2018, Island View Outfitters moved their print shop to Cuyama, a town two hours away from I.V. with “a market, a gas station and a hotel,” and little else, but with cheaper manufacturing costs and the ability to ship to anywhere in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The future is never certain, and the difficulty with a small business is we don’t have that control,” he added. “On the other side though, it’s not a matter about what the future is. It’s a matter about today, it’s a matter about the present.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/isla-vista-based-island-view-outfitters-celebrates-10th-anniversary-owner-reflects-on-companys-growth-and-future/","id":4105,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[4104,4103,4102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University, Organizations Discuss Voter Registration Efforts as California Primary Approaches","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In I.V., registration numbers have peaked at 13,000 registered voters during presidential election years.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara boasts one of the highest rates of student voter registration in the country — at 40.2% in 2018.

As of the 2010 census, more than 23,000 people live in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deadline has passed to register for the March primary, the work is hardly over for Marsano, with the November 2020 election right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I anticipate that this upcoming presidential election will be busy. Of course, we will only have three and a half weeks to register students because they come back the last week of September and the deadline to register next year is October 19 and elections are November 3,” Marsano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed UCSB’s high voter registration percentage to a greater push for in-person registration, opposed to online registration as most other universities do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s notorious about preferring face-to-face voter registration rather than online,” Marsano explained. “You would get a card and if you didn’t do something with that card and mail it back, you would not be really registered. So the follow-up was more complicated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is another important factor in the voting process that many of the organizations take on in addition to registration, according to Christian Ornelas, the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ornelas noted that the EVPLA office attempted to clear misinformation about voting after Rock the Vote SB’s national organization declared the local chapter illegitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After their first big efforts for registry during welcome week at campus dorms, Natalie Bastawros, vice president of Campus Democrats, said the VRVC went to great lengths to make sure everyone had the opportunity to register to vote in Santa Barbara County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The goal of the club is to try to make it easier for people to register,” Bastawros said about the VRVC. She explained that if an individual registers online within Santa Barbara County, and they miss a box or two, the county sends you back an additional form in the mail for you to fill out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Democrats table Monday through Friday all of winter quarter for voter registration, according to Bastawros, and have also increased door-to-door canvassing in I.V. and at university housing. An app called PDI allows Campus Democrats to access public voter registration information, allows canvassers to target locations with low registration, according to Bastawros.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations pushing for voter registration often face resistance from students who are already registered, but in a different county. A big part of tabling is educating students how local policies can have significant impact,” Bastawros said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not seem like that on the national level, but for the local elections here as students live, whether you live on campus or in I.V., it’s really, really important to register here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Feb. 18 voter registration deadline, Campus Democrats tabled at ten different locations on campus up until the 6 p.m. deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. is a “swing district” that determines the 3rd District County Supervisor vote, Bastawros said. While the other districts are fairly unwavering, the 3rd District, which encompasses I.V. and parts of northern and central Santa Barbara County, is often the deciding vote between the more rural 4th and 5th districts and the smaller but more populated 1st and 2nd districts that include Santa Barbara and Carpinteria.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash and James Bevel in the American Civil Rights Movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1967, King even offered Lafayette a position as the program director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus before the lecture, Lafayette went into detail regarding his experiences as a political organizer and a protester, working with the Nashville Student Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the SCLC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also lamented traits that he said he has seen in some present-day social movements and activists, such as a tendency to focus on the problems themselves rather than proposed solutions, as well as an inability to look at their activism from a broader perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Present-day activists] need to reexamine to see whether or not they’re taking everything into consideration. And whether or not they’re benefiting also from the laws enacted, changed and whether or not they are harmful to themselves or harmful to others as well,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Public policy is very much related to what people expect and expectations from constituencies that are involved … they can’t look at it from a narrow, narrow view. Unfortunately, people sometimes make decisions [solely] based on their own ethnic identity or political affiliation,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the arrival of advanced technology, such as the internet, has allowed people who share similar values and ways of thinking to establish forums and foster vibrant communities of activists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, for instance, changed the playing field in regards to how opinions, personal musings and even breaking news is communicated to and amongst the masses, Lafayette said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[With social media] you can communicate with large numbers of people,” he said. “We didn’t have that. We had to use little simple methods and depend so much on the public media.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with the media, however, still remains an incredibly important thing to do, Lafayette said. He added that the media is the party that will project a social movement to the broader public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we were able to accomplish the things that we accomplished, because we learned how to deal with the media. Part of the whole movement is to reach the masses of people … you need to pay special attention to maintain and sustain a movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media is [still] important … you have to learn how to maintain communication with the media in such a way that your movement is able to continue,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lafayette recalled his experience as one of the original Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who protested segregated buses in the South by riding interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in mixed-race groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Freedom Riders were arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette said he and his companions were able to create more publicity for their movement when they were taken into police custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than [make bail] and continue on to New Orleans, we decided to stay in jail a longer period of time. We stayed in jail to prolong the movement,” Lafayette said, adding that “as a result of this, we had [people from] about 11 different countries come to the U.S.” to express solidarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he began his talk, Lafayette started to discuss lineage, speaking to the crowd about his formative years growing up in the Tampa, Florida area, as well as his Afro-Caribbean and French roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the talk, Lafayette focused on the distinction between successful and unsuccessful social movements, asking, “What are some of the techniques and strategies that are actually applicable universally?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest answer to this, according to Lafayette, is also the simplest: disciplined nonviolence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He attributed the significance of civil disobedience to its ability to invalidate unjust laws without resorting to acts of violence. In particular, Lafayette emphasized the importance of accepting the legal consequences of civil disobedience in order to lend weight to one’s argument.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What you don’t want to do is behave the same way the others behave. If you’re gonna bring about change, you have to change yourself first,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You must only accept the consequences. That was the most important lesson I learned,” Lafayette said. “You have to be willing to accept the consequences when you refuse to obey an unjust law because the law is [supposed] to determine your behavior, but you make it ineffective when you ignore it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette also described the need to appeal to the popular majority in order to secure civil rights gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was Napoleon who said that no revolution has ever been won without the active support of the majority. Who do you think passed the Civil Rights Bill in Congress?” he asked the crowd. “There weren’t no Black elected officials to pass no bill. We were able to win them over.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the floor opened to questions, the audience honed in specifically on Lafayette’s relationship with the late King.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his disagreements with King, Lafayette could only recall one — whether or not the Albany Movement to desegregate public spaces in Georgia was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“King believed that we failed, but my position was that no, we succeeded in the Albany Movement. Martin Luther King would always get involved in movements that had larger impact and bring about some national change or national legislation,” Lafayette said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might have resolved that if he lived.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how he responded to the news of King’s death, Lafayette described how the tragedy reinstilled in him the drive to continue King’s work. Lafayette said he devoted his energy and attention to King’s broader long-term goal: to spread the practice of nonviolence across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to make a decision, with the news of his death … I decided to focus on the last words that King said to me: ‘We have got to internationalize and institutionalize nonviolence.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After King’s death, Lafayette returned to school to further educate himself on the law and the utility of nonviolence in social and political advocacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went to law school at Boston University because I wanted to think like a lawyer. I didn’t want to be a lawyer, but I wanted to think like a lawyer. Then I went to Harvard University to study nonviolence and education, and I got my master’s.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After college, he would continue to work as an activist for decades, becoming a distinguished authority on nonviolent strategies for social activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with nonviolence, Lafayette said persistence is also a key ingredient in the making of a successful social movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, I was beaten in Selma, Alabama, the same night that Medgar Evers who was in the NAACP, in Mississippi, was shot and killed. And they planned to do the same thing to me the same night,” Lafayette said. “Fortunately, I survived that.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The FBI reported to me that [the Ku Klux Klan] had a plan to castrate me, to throw me in the river, and all that, you know. But fortunately I survived it,” he added. “ Don’t give up on the campaign, no matter what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

for implementation. </span><em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies major, is authoring a proposal to present to the UCSB Academic Senate that would dissolve the requirement and merge it into the World Cultures requirement, after she gained the unanimous support of the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S. Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, titled “A Resolution To Abandon the European Traditions Requirement,” was authored by Off-Campus Senators Kimia Hadidi and Adalis Rojas and passed at the Feb. 19 Senate meeting. However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The documentary was compiled as a mid-century reflection after the bank burned down 50 years ago on Feb. 25, 1970.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93125\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054792904\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93120\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-image-93125 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1-1024x710.jpg?resize=888%2C616\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"616\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista. </span><em>Courtesy of UCSB Library Special Collections</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista, providing listeners with the sights and sounds of the turmoil, until the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office forced the station to shut down for five days, according to Tim Owens, a former UC Santa Barbara student and the current general manager of KCSB. The police department claimed at the time that the radio station was preventing them from doing their jobs in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Owens explained, I.V.’s Bank of America at the time had become a symbol of the capitalist establishment, which many student activists attributed as the cause of oppressive social issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hour-long special takes listeners on a deep dive into the KCSB archives, featuring KCSB news coverage of the Isla Vista riots — often phoned in at the scene from telephone booths — the bank burning and recordings that depicted police violence against protestors, according to Lisa Osborn, current news director at KCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound bites from key players like the Santa Barbara Police Department and then-defense attorney in the Chicago Seven trial William Kunstler, as well as accounts from former students, provide different perspectives on what happened and the consequences that followed. Sound bites of I.V. and narration from Owens illustrate the entirety of I.V. in 1970, later coined the “Year of Rebellion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For Isla Vista, 1970 was the scene of a bank burning, a fatal shooting with a student by a police office, novel law enforcement riot tactics, police brutality and mass arrests,” Owens said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What came in February, April and June in Isla Vista spun its web around the symbol of the establishment: the Bank of America,” Owen said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program takes a chronological approach, starting with the events that lead up to the Bank of America burning in February before taking listeners through the consequences that followed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A day before the Bank of America building burned, the special says the Santa Barbara Police arrested two men. According to the special, the warrants for their arrests cited their use of obscenities during an earlier protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An argument ensued between the officers and the men, forming a crowd that quickly grew upset when the men were arrested. The crowd took action, desecrating the policeman’s car and eventually lighting it on fire. Another officer removed the police from the scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, and hours before the infamous bank burning, Kunstler had been scheduled to speak at the Harder stadium. The special included the audio from Kunstler’s speech at Harder Stadium, which focused on the frustrations of youth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In his book, Justice Douglas said the establishment today is the same as George the third. And he said if the establishment does not stop its stampede toward oppression and repression, then the only honorable course is what men did in 1776,” Kunstler said in his speech at Harder Stadium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owens explained how the timing of Kunstler’s speech, and the bank burning later that day, led the former state Attorney General to investigate Kunstler for inciting a riot. No evidence involving Kunstler was found, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when authorities showed up later that evening to control the crowds gathered on Embarcadero del Norte, they “proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds of tear gas at the demonstrators,” the special stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions climaxed at the Bank of America building, where Embarcadero Hall stands today. The bank was first looted and later set on fire — twice —  first around 7 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and again around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, KCSB was broadcasting it all live. Owens extracted these clips from vintage KCSB archives to allow listeners to hear from the reporters who very first covered it, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pardall may be clear now, I’m not sure. I am beginning to feel the tear gas in my throat. I hear teargas rockets continuing to be fired off, which means they are coming from the overpass,” an unnamed KCSB reporter phoned in to the radio station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the chaos ensued, KCSB student reporters described the riot’s atmosphere, preserving the sounds and images they witnessed from the streets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An incendiary device has been thrown into the Bank of America right now, and it is burning very brightly on the floor with high flames shooting almost to the roof,” an anonymous KCSB reporter said. “However, again, you have your opposing factions in Isla Vista because almost as soon as that device was off inside the Bank of America, two guys went running through and attempted to stomp out the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 18, a second riot occured at the bank. Violence ensued when it became known that the UCSB administration canceled a scheduled speech by a Chicago 7 defendant, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this riot, Santa Barbara police officer David Gosselin shot and killed 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran, an economics major who was seeking to protect the bank from other student protestors. Gosselin, according to the special, claimed his rifle had misfired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemonium and confusion caused by the heavy exchange of gunfire during the first moments of conflict make it impossible at this time to accurately determine whether or not the officer fired the fatal projectile,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff James Webster said in a sound bite from a press conference featured in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the second protest, KCSB was ordered by Sheriff Webster to shut down its broadcasts; Webster stated at the time that KCSB’s broadcasting of the officer’s operations and locations were “making the enforcement of this area absolutely intolerable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webster claimed he had the authority to shut down KCSB’s broadcasts despite dismissing questions about federal protections over the press, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shut down KCSB — that’s very rare, because we’re licensed by the federal government, not the local cops, but because the Regents hold our license, supposedly, they wanted us off the air,” Osborn said, explaining how local police blamed KCSB for inciting violence at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB returned to air five days later and continued to cover life in I.V., including having interviews with community residents who recounted the violence they witnessed. During the special, one woman recounts seeing the police assaulting her husband, describing the sequence as she chokes back tears. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Somebody yelled, ‘I think the police were coming.’ He stopped and the police rushed up the stairs, grabbed him and hit him in the stomach and dragged him down,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third disturbance in June led to a strictly enforced curfew and an increased presence from the Los Angeles Special Enforcement Bureau in I.V., leading to numerous complaints from residents, according to Owens in the documentary. Godfrey recalls that from dusk until dawn, no one was allowed outside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of America eventually closed its Isla Vista branch for good in 1981; now, Embarcadero Hall, a UCSB lecture hall, stands in its place.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/","id":4103,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4102,4101,4100],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":11,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
