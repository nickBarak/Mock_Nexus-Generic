His item of interest: a bright red, wooden phallus measuring about two feet long with dark hair sprouting out of the base.</p>\n<p>The story behind the phallus begins in Bhutan, a small country located between India and China, which was greatly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. Early in Bhutan’s history, it was believed a mad yogi named Drukpa Kunley traveled from Tibet and drew crowds with his crazy antics.</p>\n<p>His greatest skill was seducing female demons with his charisma and “defeating” them with his phallus.</p>\n<p>To this day, the people of Bhutan still celebrate Drukpa’s genitals. Hillis has taken several trips to Bhutan.</p>\n<p>“There are pictures of his penis everywhere,” he said. “Then you will see [phalluses] just hanging in people’s homes and temples to ward off demons.”</p>\n<p>He bought his phallus from a local shop in Bhutan. Hillis has used it as a prop in his Tibetan religion and intro to religion classes.</p>\n<p>“When I would show the class, some of the smart alecks would respond with ‘it’s a dildo,’” Hillis said.</p>\n<p>The phallus definitely grabbed his students’ attention. However, Hillis said it represents something different than a dildo: “Sex and the power of procreation is holy, and it’s amazing … What makes a religion a religion is that it is connected in some way to what people think is holy or sacred.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74265\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74265\" data-attachment-id=\"74265\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/candace-waid-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"candace-waid-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74265 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"candace-waid-online-1\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Rebekah Akiyoshi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>The Colors of Candace Waid’s Office</strong><br>\nBright colors of red, yellow and green illuminate the walls of Candace Waid’s office. Four paintings and one ink drawing stand in a line for the eye to follow.</p>\n<p>Waid is a professor of the English and comparative literature department with 18 years of teaching at UCSB on her resume. Also notable, she is the author of The Signifying Eye: Seeing Faulkner’s Art, an in-depth study of William Faulkner’s abstract art.</p>\n<p>These paintings and drawings were all given to her as gifts from former students, some who went on to become painters. Asked why students give her art, she said, “they know I care about color, and I’m all about paintings.” Some of the titles of the paintings in her office include “Alien Corn,” “Oklahoma Alabama” and “Guadalupe.”</p>\n<p>A still-life above Waid’s computer is credited as the work of a past first-year student, Natalie O’Brien. She credits O’Brien for founding The Catalyst, a magazine of poems, stories and art submitted by UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Together, they worked on the “digital fires of the Internet” to study ekphrasis, art expressing another form of art, like a poem talking about a painting.</p>\n<p>“These paintings bring joy to me. Just to see the sunlight coming in and reflecting off the Pacific onto the paintings makes me happy to work and be with people,” Waid said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74263\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74263\" data-attachment-id=\"74263\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/patricia-fumerton-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"patricia-fumerton-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74263\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"Rebekah Akiyoshi / Daily Nexus\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patricia-Fumerton-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74263\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Rebekah Akiyoshi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Fumerton’s Special Force</strong><br>\nAs a professor of English at UCSB for over 30 years, Patricia Fumerton understands how to connect with students in a very personal way. At the end of her classes, she receives many little gifts from students who appreciate her teachings.</p>\n<p>One of her prized possessions stands on her windowsill, serving as a constant reminder of her favorite reason for teaching. Given to her by a former student back in 1990, a Darth Vader action figure with a swivel base and standing at eight inches tall strikes fear in all who enter her office.</p>\n<p>The movie series “Star Wars” serves as her teaching metaphor to the classic epic story, <em>Beowulf</em>. The hero of the story, Beowulf, takes on the dark monster, Grendel.</p>\n<p>“Beowulf is taking on the dark side … you have to take on the opposing forces of evil … often take the form of a relative,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fumerton uses this comparison in her classes because “as students hear it, they connect very quickly.” She loves to connect bigger concepts like good versus evil back to students’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I treasure these plastic gifts, because they mean the student gets it, and it means enough to them that they want to give me a memento … it’s my connection to the students,” Fumerton said. “Whenever I look at him, I remember how fun it was teaching <em>Beowulf</em>.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74278\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74278\" data-attachment-id=\"74278\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74278\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Remembering WWI with John W.I. Lee</strong><br>\nJohn W.I. Lee is an associate professor at UCSB and has worked here for the past 16 years. He is currently on leave writing his book and taking care of his new baby, born this past summer. In his office, Lee displays an array of 10 helmets from World War I.</p>\n<p>These helmets are a timeline of steel integration. Before the war, people had romantic ideas of war and wore decorative caps that did not protect their heads. As trench warfare increased, so did reported head injuries.</p>\n<p>Lee highlights a specific helmet called the French Adrian, which was the first mass-produced steel helmet in Europe.</p>\n<p>“We are living in a world shaped by the outcome of WWI,” said Lee, who studies changing warfare throughout history.</p>\n<p>For the past year, Lee has been working on a project to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI. He invited first-year student Sydney Martin to help with extensive research and report write-ups. The project will be an exhibition to display the helmets for UCSB students to view firsthand.</p>\n<p>“There is nothing better to educate others than having them see it up front and personal,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>Lee is borrowing these helmets from a local collector in Santa Barbara, who is interested in history and student learning. For those interested in learning more about WWI, this exhibition will be on display on the first floor of the UCSB library in November.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74221\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74221\" data-attachment-id=\"74221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/6o2a8930/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a8930\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Samuel Sweet’s Botanical Indoor Garden</strong><br>\nSamuel Sweet is a professor of ecology and evolution who knows a few things about keeping plants alive. On the far side of his office sit two pots of around 20 fan palms, all standing over six feet tall. The backstory for these palms’ installment begins on a somber note.</p>\n<p>About a year and a half ago, a row of eucalyptus trees stood outside of Sweet’s office. These trees were about 150 years old and over 150 feet tall.</p>\n<p>“Idiots cut [the row] down so they could park a few construction trucks while building the new bioengineering building,” Sweet said.</p>\n<p>Without the trees, sunlight caused hot temperatures in his office during the afternoon. The construction company offered to paint over the office’s windows, but Sweet olitely declined the offer. Now, the palms serve an important purpose for the office of this professor: to keep the sun out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of

The district as a whole registered around 9,600 more people this year than in the 2012 election.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista voter registration drives set a new record during the last week of October, registering over 13,000 new voters for the November election. Approximately 11,000 students were registered in 2012 and 10,800 were registered in 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB leads other universities such as UCLA, which reported approximately 10,100 registered voters, USC, which registered a mere 411 students according to The Daily Bruin and UC San Diego, which reported around 3,000 registered voters according to the UCSD voter registration coalition.</p>\n<p>“They have done a better job of turnout in Isla Vista than I have ever seen, over 13,000 voters voted in Isla Vista today, and it’s because of the very, very hard work of these democrat activists,” Das Williams, supervisor elect, said.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara County, 60 percent of the presidential votes went to Secretary Clinton, 32 percent to Trump, 3.5 percent to Gary Johnson and 2 percent were write-ins. California is undeniably a liberal state, so higher voter turnout likely wouldn’t have changed any results here, but in other states voter turnout could have made all the difference in this pinnacle election.</p>\n<p>Millennials proved to be a major force in this year’s election. A photo from SurveyMonkey showing the country’s Electoral College votes if only millennials had voted went viral on Tuesday, with the large majority of them, 473 to be exact, going to Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Millennials supported Clinton with 54 percent of the youth vote, but many millennials are angry with rumors of thousands of young people writing in “Harambe” on their ballots or even for voting for third-party candidates. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported, “For the Democratic Party to move forward and win, young people — some of the party’s most vocal critics — cannot be shut out of what will be a rebuilding process.”</p>\n<p>The 3rd District County Board of Supervisors had a large turnout of 25,136 votes with Joan Hartmann leading Bruce Porter by 8 percent. The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District had a total of 7,317 votes to reelect Pegeen Soutar as director of the District.</p>\n<p>Measures E and F had an underwhelming amount of voter turnout with approximately 4,150 votes on each measure. Measure E passed with a significant majority of 88 percent, but Measure F, which only 62 percent of people voted yes on, did not pass. If voter turnout had been even higher, perhaps Measure F would have gone through or results for various different offices could have been different.</p>\n<p>Though turnout was strong, an anonymous Campus Democrats volunteer said that word of mouth was that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday only half of registered voters in I.V. had actually voted.</p>\n<p>In 2008, national voter turnout was relatively high at 62.3 percent but dropped in 2012 to an estimated 57.5 percent. This year’s turnout, expected to level around 55.6 percent according to the U.S. Elections Project, shows a trend toward Americans across the country not casting their vote. Reasons for not voting range from being blocked or restricted, being too busy with work and/or childcare, to simply deciding not to vote on principle, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<p><em>A

Though a significant amount of the country voted to put a woman in the highest office in the land, others are more concerned about what the candidate’s policies were.</p>\n<p>Eileen Boris, professor in the Department of Feminist Studies at UCSB, said feminist leaders are necessary, and while the gender of the president is significant, it is more important for there to be a feminist, in particular, in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“I think it makes more of a difference [if] we have a feminist in the White House … It makes more of a difference not the embodiment of the person but the policies of a person,” Professor Boris said.</p>\n<p>As for what particular policies a feminist would bring into office, Boris said, a feminist in office will bring a commitment to what is often called the ‘working family dilemma,’ that is, how do we organize the relationship between getting a living and daily life.”</p>\n<p>In local politics, Joan Hartmann secured the Third District Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors seat on Tuesday, beating rival Bruce Porter 13,563 to 11,511.</p>\n<p>When asked whether Hartmann’s election to the board of supervisors would make a difference in the community, Boris seemed to summarize many of the general election’s prevailing tensions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74136\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1780941814\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74125\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74136\" data-attachment-id=\"74136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-women-gain-power-in-government/hbj-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hbj-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74136\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Hannah-Beth Jackson speaks to a supporter at the Democrat watch party Tuesday.

Organizers welcome poets, musicians and comedians.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLAH BACK</strong><br>\nUCSB Challah for Hunger hosts a bread sale from 12-2 p.m. Friday on the I.V. Food Co-op patio.

The memorial garden was to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>BUILDING A COMMUNITY</strong><br>\nThere will be another meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center at 1 p.m. Saturday in the I.V.

The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC) will be hosting the discussion and providing lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>SOW AND REAP</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Food Co-op is hosting a gardening workshop from 12-2 p.m. Sunday on the Co-op patio.

This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>CHICKEN FOR KIDS</strong><br>\nEating dinner at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch (149 N. Fairview Avenue) between 5-9 p.m. on Tuesday will partially benefit the Isla Vista Youth Projects. The organization is currently undergoing a campaign to raise $300,000 before the end of the year so that it may qualify for an additional $300,000 grant from the county. Isla Vista Youth Projects intends to use the $600,000 to buy their building and close phase one of their capital campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE FOOD</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students.

E and F and Joan Hartmann, Isla Vistans often saw the signs for Congresswoman Lois Capps, Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Yes on Prop 30.</p>\n<p>Although it was not as high as this year’s voter

and measures rather than national elections.</p>\n<p>“It was an interesting year because the thing that drove turnout in I.V. was Prop 30, which was education funding, which affected turnout more than the presidential election since the excitement for the presidential election wasn’t like it was in 2008,” Daraka Larimore-Hall, chairman of the Santa Barbara Democratic Party, said.</p>\n<p>“It was

The ultimate fate of the CSD, however, hangs on the passage of the UUT.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p>This leads to another issue: deciding when to put the UUT on the ballot again.</p>\n<p>Elliott said CSD board members could very well decide to propose the UUT in the next midterm election in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74096\" style=\"width: 6010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1521561605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74096\" data-attachment-id=\"74096\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/flashback-election-2012/dsc03790/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=6000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dsc03790\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, running another campaign would prove costly, Freeman said, and organizers are unsure where to obtain funds for subsequent campaigns.

She said they misled voters to believe the tax would significantly increase rent, when, in actuality, the tax would have only been an additional $5 to $10 every month.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes also gained an advantage over Yes on E&amp;F, she said, because they placed flyers on cars throughout Isla Vista. According to Elliott, this is what made Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes an “illegal” campaign.</p>\n<p>“If we left flyers on everyone’s cars, the results might have been different, but we would have been breaking county ordinance,” she said.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property owner who led the opposition to Measure F, said the measure didn’t pass simply because it is a “horrible” measure. This is why voters were afraid, he said.</p>\n<p>“What [Elliott] says is probably true, but a lot of times the truth will make people fearful of what will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Fear is the reason Measure F failed, Elliott said, and it has been a driving force throughout this election cycle.</p>\n<p>“In general in this election, fear won over hope,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

Legal Code.</p>\n<p>The bill proposed that all gender binary pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) and accompanying grammar be altered for gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs).</p>\n<p>Senator Elias Jordan got the idea for the bill during a training session when Christine Dolan, associate director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), spoke about the importance of society becoming more gender inclusive.</p>\n<p>“We know that LGBTQ people are everywhere, at every intersection of identities, and we know that all oppression is connected,” Dolan says in her Student Affairs biography. “Our liberation is collective, and until we can join in solidarity to challenge racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and other systems of oppression, we cannot be free.”</p>\n<p>The bill gained student interest after the Senate’s retreat, prompting Jordan to get it passed quickly. He worked at his high school’s resource and counseling center to become more informed on topics of gender diversity and sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I thought this could be a big step forward on a larger scale, considering how prestigious UCSB is,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>The legislation, which was the first piece proposed by the Senate member, was slowed down because of minor writing issues. It experienced no opposition in Senate.</p>\n<p>Changing an official document to accommodate every person, Jordan said, validates people on campus who don’t feel as if they have a voice.</p>\n<p>UCSB took another step toward inclusivity this summer when the Office of Registrar worked with the RCSGD to update the school’s system so that ACCESS cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students would change according to the student’s preferred name.</p>\n<p>Pronouns haven’t been altered in the system, but students who identify with a different first name can use it without having to change any legal documents.</p>\n<p>Jordan said he hopes the legislation can prompt both individuals, as well as other institutions, to think about the acceptance of others and the role we as individuals play in that.</p>\n<p>“Depending on how far it could spread, I think we can help people think about the diversity that we have as something to celebrate and not sweep under the rug,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/","id":2712,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2711,2710,2709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Youth Projects has been serving since 1971 through four programs: the Children’s Center, the After School Program, the Family Resource Center and Thrive I.V.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center serves children up to five years old, the After School Program serves children in kindergarten through the sixth grade, the Family Resource Center serves families of all sizes and Thrive focuses on “preparing students to enter kindergarten” and the “social-emotional component,” according to Thrive coordinator Julie Lara.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects aims to develop their niche even further by purchasing the Children’s Center building they currently occupy at 6842 Phelps Road. To do this, they must raise $300,000 by Dec. 31 in order to qualify for an additional $300,000 block grant from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center started out as a “very small program with just 20 students,” according to Juan Pimentel, the After School Program director, but has grown to “over 100” with waiting lists for all of the programs.</p>\n<p>From an overall campaign goal of $1.9 million, $1.2 million will be directed toward the Children’s Center, according to LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons why the I.V. Youth Project finds it so necessary to purchase the building is to keep costs low for the children and families who use the services provided by I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges of living in Santa Barbara is the cost of living, and childcare is pretty expensive … so having a children’s center here in I.V. … at either a very low cost or on scholarship most of the time is a really great opportunity,” said Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Just like many of the students at UCSB who worry about rent increases, the I.V. Youth Projects shares those same worries about renting the space for the Children’s Center. Both Pimentel and Miller said owning the building would prevent increases in program costs and save money in the long term.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t too much money to sponsor, say, another parenting class or another need that we might see,” said Lara. By not having to allocate money for rent every month, Lara said she hopes “any funding that does come in we can use for actual programming to make our facilities better.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects will host several fundraisers over the next month, including gatherings at Woodstocks, Panda Express and Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch. The group has also teamed up with Deckers Brand for a holiday shopping event.</p>\n<p>Money is even tighter at I.V. Youth Projects due to the fact that the childcare organization is independent from any national nonprofit organization. Additionally, I.V. is an unincorporated city, so I.V. Youth Projects does not receive city funding, according to Miller.</p>\n<p>“We do have some funding from the city of Goleta and from the County of Santa Barbara,” Miller said, but the organization doesn’t have access to “a lot of the same funding revenue stream that a lot of the other nonprofits might have that are located within a city.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects welcomes donations from any and all I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any donation big or small helps,” Miller said. “It’s very important to us that every child, no matter where they live … deserves to have an equal access to a superior education and a good walk on life.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch fundraiser will be hosted Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 5-9 p.m. and the Panda Express fundraiser will be hosted Friday, Dec. 9, from 12-9 p.m. in the Fairview Shopping Center.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Some students remain unbothered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carmiya Baskin, a first-year residing in San Miguel, said, “there are always people on the lawn talking,” and the bird calls have not really disturbed her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Wu, an RA in San Miguel, sent a text message to residents stating there had been “a lot of noise complaints lately. A lot of it is coming from outside the building … the RAs are currently working on investigating this issue.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she doesn’t know the total amount of noise complaints, she has received over 10 noise complaints from her floors alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residence hall staff has identified and spoken to several students from San Nicolas, though no student was individually documented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the bird calls have decreased in volume and frequency, they are still taking place. The RAs hope to put a stop to it by reminding students about quiet hours and keeping an eye out for more trouble.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Finance and Business Committee for an upcoming event featuring Ben Shapiro, a political commentator who will present a criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>Shapiro, former editor of conservative news source Breitbart, last <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/fox-contributor-speaks-on-guns-media-at-ucsb/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke at UCSB</a> in 2013. He has previously been banned from speaking engagements at other universities and was escorted off the CSU Los Angeles campus in May 2016 due to protests.</p>\n<p>During the College Republicans’ lengthy presentation, speakers swore more than once and had to field multiple questions from the finance and business committee, including doubts about safety.</p>\n<p>“Our purpose is not to be offensive for the sake of being offensive; that’s childish, and no one wants that,” Andrew Gates, president of College Republicans, told the <em>Nexus</em>. “We believe that offering a different perspective would open a civil dialogue.”</p>\n<p>The group asked for $350 to reserve Corwin Pavilion, $650 for security and $4,000 for Shapiro’s speaker fee.</p>\n<p>The hefty security budget of $650 highlights an underlying risk of violence. Gates has organized similar events in the past and reassured the committee there would be no tolerance for any form of violence.</p>\n<p>“We won’t assault anyone,” he said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Two attendees in support of College Republicans were seated at the front of the room wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, drawing looks of disapproval from other audience members.</p>\n<p>Shapiro has been vocal in his criticism in the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that it lacks values and acts as a source of violence.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, Ben Shapiro has a message, and we agree with that message,” Gates said, “Anyone who thinks he’s irrational or immoral or the worst person ever is free to [say] so at the Q&amp;A portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>“I understand the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement; I understand the reasoning behind the name,” Gates said, but added that he takes issue with how statistics are applied to support assertions of inequality in black communities.</p>\n<p>Gates also said it’s unfair to suggest that white people cannot be subject to racism.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of a clever way of in academia to get away with saying shitty things about white people,” he said.</p>\n<p>After heated discussion between committee members, finance and business committee chairman Reilly Hobson interjected, reminding everyone that ideology does not influence whether a group should receive funding.</p>\n<p>After an initial objection, followed by a vote with seven members voting to approve funding and four members abstaining, College Republicans were granted the funds.</p>\n<p>They are pursuing additional funding from Young Americans for Liberty as well as other conservative political organizations in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>The funding is pending approval by the A.S. Senate during Wednesday’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Nazari was known as the “Roofless Barber” in high school because he used to cut hair outside, and the name now appears on his business cards.</p>\n<p>“My principal caught me once and was like, ‘You can’t be doing this,’ and I still kept doing it,” he said. “And the janitors knew me, they would leave a broom out for me.”</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Nazari first started cutting hair after an icebreaker.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Hi, I’m Gilbert, and I cut hair,’ and I ended up running out of 250 cards. And it’s only been two months,” Nazari said.</p>\n<p>In his time at UCSB, Nazari has worked with approximately 40 clients. At a price tag of $13, his haircuts are cheaper than most nearby hair salons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73667\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1239892528\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73658\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73667\" data-attachment-id=\"73667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/uc-santa-barber-first-year-student-runs-authentic-salon-out-of-anacapa/30512299552_313359464e_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"30512299552_313359464e_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73667\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Nazari apprenticed for two years, and hopes to give each of his clients a professional barbering experience. \" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=5184&amp;ssl=1 5184w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nazari brought all his barbering tools from home, and is allowed to operate in the dorms as long as he cleans up after each appointment. <em>Courtesy Nathan Mai</em></p></div>\n<p>He has already established several regulars; one customer has returned three times in the two months that he’s been here.</p>\n<p>“$13 and he’ll spend over 30 minutes cutting your hair,” said Vijay Parameswaran, first-year economics major who was particularly shaggy prior to his haircut. “Great customer service and he’s really easy to talk to.
