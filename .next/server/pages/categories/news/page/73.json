Ross Trindle, general counsel for the CSD, said at the board’s Sept. 12 meeting that the court’s decision in the California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland case could create a pathway to a new tax for Isla Vistans if the board decides to act as the ruling seems to suggest.</p>\n<p>The court decision suggests that the board will have the option to bring the tax to a special election or vote on it directly at a board meeting if 10 percent of voters bring signatures supporting an ordinance proposing a tax to the county.</p>\n<p>If the board chooses to pass the tax directly at a board meeting, voters will be stripped of their power to vote. In November 2016, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locals shot down the tax</a> when Measure F received less than a two-thirds majority of the vote.</p>\n<p>A special election is a vote that could be called immediately, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>The ordinance voters would create is subject to the county’s approval and must outline the exact ways in which the tax would be collected and how the funds would be spent.</p>\n<p>Trindle said his interpretation of the court ruling was widely debated by legal scholars and that it is currently unclear whether the board would be able to take this option. He suggested the board focus on the issue in the “user utility tax ballot measure ad-hoc committee” created to work on putting the tax on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“I throw this out there because there is a very large question that is unresolved,” Trindle said. “There are legal scholars, colleagues on one side, that say the issue is very narrow… and there are media accounts and experts on the other side that say, ‘No that’s absolutely thrown into question.’”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> contacted the offices of Supervisor Joan Hartmann, the District Attorney and the County of Santa Barbara’s legal counsel for comment on the legality of Trindle’s interpretation of the court ruling.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, none have responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an organization that helped amend the state constitution to require a two-thirds majority to pass a tax, was “very disappointed” with the court’s ruling because it could be interpreted as a way to circumvent the supermajority necessary to pass a tax.</p>\n<p>“They’ve specifically come out and commented that this would allow for ‘collusion’ between governments and special interest groups to effectively back-door taxes through this lower-level of scrutiny process,” Trindle said.</p>\n<p>In an interview last month, board chair Ethan Bertrand told the<em> Nexus</em> there were plans to put the tax on the ballot in June or November of 2018 and said he was confident it would pass.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78801\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78801\" data-attachment-id=\"78801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/csd-new-tax-by-william-tracy-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD NEW TAX BY WILLIAM TRACY-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78801\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>William Tracy / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Trindle’s comments at the end of the Sept. 12 meeting, however, present the board an opportunity to essentially bypass voters and create the tax through a simple majority at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Voters last attempted to pass a tax in I.V. in November 2016, when it created the CSD through Measure E. Measures E and F were broadly campaigned to be voted on jointly, with E establishing the district and F funding it through a tax on the use of utilities in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Pressure slowly mounts on the CSD as it could be terminated if it fails to pass a tax. The bill that created the I.V. CSD, Assembly Bill 3, says “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>I.V. lawmakers will be weighing the decision to create the tax independent of most voters’ input or to bring the issue to the public. Some board members have spoken out against the move.</p>\n<p>Speaking on the subject, which was not on the meeting’s agenda, Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said at the meeting that voting directly on a tax through the board would give the public a perception that was “sketchy.”</p>\n<p>“If we’re as concerned as we are with transparency and due process, this is a novel approach,” Hedges said before being reminded by Director Jay Freeman that he was not legally allowed to speak on the subject.</p>\n<p>The Ralph M. Brown Act limits board conversations to the subjects on the agenda posted to the public.</p>\n<p>In a text message to a reporter, Freeman said he opposed bringing the tax to a vote of the board and called the possibility of using this new court ruling a “legal hack.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that if we are to raise a tax we should use the process people expect,” Freeman said. “Tax measures should go to the voters.”</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop. Agenda and other meeting materials can be found at <em>islavistacsd.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Language in this article was changed to make clearer it is not certain whether the court’s ruling allows for this method of creating a tax, but does not rule out the possibility. Trindle was also previously misquoted as saying the CSD should create a new ad-hoc committee, while he actually said the board should take the issue to an existing ad-hoc committee, the UUT Ballot Measure Ad-Hoc Committee.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

UC Santa Barbara has four dining commons across campus, and the building construction will make Portola the university’s largest dining common.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons are located near the Santa Catalina freshmen dorms on El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the building construction cost approximately $20.37 million.</p>\n<p>The original design of the dining commons began in 2013, according to KieranTimberlake, the architecture firm that designed Portola. Construction began in 2015 after the firm completed the building design in 2014.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited to see this project come to life,” Jill Horst, director of dining services, said in an email. “I can’t wait for our guests to walk [through] the doors and experience this amazing venue while exploring a culinary feast-food innovation at its best with flavors forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Horst, the old dining commons contained approximately 450 seats, while the new building has 600 indoor seats and 200 seats on the outdoor patio. The university is in the process of hiring more student and full-time employees to accommodate the increase in the dining commons’ capacity.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons will be supplied with specialized cooking equipment, including a tandoori oven, rotisserie oven and tortilla machine in the bakery.</p>\n<p>Students will also be able to see their food prepared through the six open kitchens, said Carin Whitney, spokesperson from KieranTimberlake, adding that the cooking and serving areas of the dining commons are “integral” to its overall design.</p>\n<p>“The culinary experience is architectural,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Whitney said the university and architecture team considered the dining commons’ environmental effects in its design and operation, including energy-efficient cooking equipment, sustainable food service practices and a solar hot water system for washing dishes.</p>\n<p>“The team expects high performance benchmarks once [the] building opens for service,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The cost of the Portola Dining Commons’ construction was unavailable at the time of publication and has since been added to the article. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The I.V. community has witnessed several movements in favor of cityhood, but the state ultimately determined these efforts to be politically and financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury determined that a CSD would be the best option to represent the unincorporated community.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB-3) was introduced to the state assembly in 2014 and would effectively create a new government in I.V. capable of addressing the needs of the “transient student population” and its “predominantly renter-oriented” community.</p>\n<p>The bill also assigns the CSD powers to provide services related to infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. Governor Jerry Brown signed AB-3 into law on Oct. 7, 2015, paving the way for Measure E to be on the ballot in Nov. 2016.</p>\n<p>Measure E was the ballot measure to formally create the Isla Vista CSD and was coupled on the ballot with Measure F, a utility user tax meant to fund the district through an 8 percent tax on gas, water, electricity, sewage and garbage disposal for users in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>CSD Financial Strains</strong></p>\n<p>While most of the country focused on welcoming and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/over-1000-uc-santa-barbara-students-protest-in-isla-vista-after-trump-elected-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting</a> a new president on Nov. 9, 2016, I.V. residents also saw the birth of a new government by voting a resounding 87.52 percent “yes” on Measure E.</p>\n<p>The measure created the Isla Vista CSD with voters electing Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan as directors to lead the newly formed government.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman described the district as an “experiment” in providing small-scale government that has the “visceral” ability for students to become involved because of its relationship with UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Measure F, however, received 61.22 percent of the total vote in favor, failing to reach the two-third (66 percent) vote necessary to impose the tax. This effectively left the CSD fundless and with little ability to finance the services it wished to provide.</p>\n<p>The failure to pass this tax is worrisome for the future of the district, as AB-3 stipulates that “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand, however, remains confident in its future.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> Tuesday, Bertrand said there are plans to put the tax on the ballot once more in June or November of next year. He also said the district has received approximately $6,500 in funding from private donations, grants and contributions from Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Establishing Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The CSD held its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first meeting in March</a> and has been meeting every two weeks since then.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the district tries to make its meetings “as interactive as possible” because it works with all aspects of the community, including students, families and businesses.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of the beauty of a small government that we have the ability to kind of work directly with [the public],” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. now has two entities directly governing it: the Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), a small body established in 1972 to regulate parks and other outdoor spaces, and the CSD, a body with broader governing powers.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the administrative framework took a long time to build but said he feels the CSD is now “getting [its] wings” as it begins to provide services.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals of the CSD</strong></p>\n<p>According to Bertrand, public safety is “the top priority,” as the CSD is working with UCSB to acquire this year’s $200,000 in annual funding for the next seven years. The university <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pledged</a> this funding during the district’s creation for “mutually agreed-upon projects, programs and services.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he is in interested in “community-oriented policing services” rather than placing sworn officers on the streets. He said he believes this will solidify the relationship between residents and law enforcement and will contribute to a decline in the amount of sexual assault in I.V., which has<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/sexual-assault-reports-up-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> increased in recent years</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to that sum, the district is applying for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation, a local philanthropy, and acquired $3,000 from the Fund for Santa Barbara for “community programming.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the district plans to use the funds to schedule community meetings at the Community Conference Room in I.V., currently used for CSD meetings, and loan it to organizations interested in gathering there.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the room can only be used for noncommercial purposes but said the district will not focus on the content of the meetings that happen there. Managing the room’s scheduling would be the first service the CSD provides since its creation.</p>\n<p>The CSD created an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/new-csd-interns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internship program</a> in conjunction with UCSB’s political science department in Spring Quarter, employing five interns to-date, but has not yet provided large-scale services to I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The district’s ability to provide services has been bogged down significantly by its lack of funding, as well as its lack of structure, as it has spent several months drafting policies and developing procedures to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hopes</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSD continues to develop and find new funding sources for the services it intends to provide, its directors express optimism toward the newborn government’s future.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the CSD was created to make I.V. a safer place and to give the community the “long-deserved voice” within local government.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge step for participatory government in I.V.,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>“If you have any interest at all in how society operates, in how all of those services that you rely on everyday [are provided] … even if we’re not the ones providing to you, we are a model by which you can learn how government functions,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The California Highway Patrol will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation, which is expected to be completed by Sept. 15. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The County Public Works Department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The traffic signal at the intersection was first discussed in the mid-2000s as part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a long-term infrastructure project for I.V.</p>\n<p>County Public Works director Scott McGolpin said Southern California Edison electric company will remove the existing eight streetlights at the intersection within the next week and the new traffic signal poles will replace the streetlight infrastructure.</p>\n<p>According to Lieutenant Steve Larson of the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the CHP will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation.</p>\n<p>“People need to realize that once a light goes on, it is enforceable,” Larson said. “If the light is red, the light is red. The bicyclists, the skateboarders, they all have to stop at the stoplight.”</p>\n<p>According to the County Public Works Department, the project costs $300,000. The public works department will fund half the cost and UC Santa Barbara will provide funding for the other half.</p>\n<p>McGolpin described the installation as a “pretty easy job” because it will be completed on the sidewalks, allowing cars, bikers and pedestrians to still use the street during construction.</p>\n<p>The traffic signal will not have sensors but will operate on a timer of approximately 20 seconds. Pedestrians will be able to see how many seconds they have to cross the street to adjust their speed.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said 20 seconds is the approximate time it takes the slowest pedestrian to cross the street at the intersection.</p>\n<p>McGolpin also said the county plans to coordinate with local artists to paint the signal cabinets, similar to those on El Colegio. He said he hopes this will minimize the chance of graffiti on the cabinets.</p>\n<p>The project will be as noninvasive as possible, he said, because the department does not want to damage the construction completed on Pardall Road in 2009. The 2009 construction included the installation of the streetlights and palm trees, as well as pouring new concrete at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“We want to minimize the damage because we did the improvements along Pardall and it would be costly to remove all that,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the county has discussed the project with the Isla Vista Community Network, local businesses, the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and local residents. He said it also plans to work with law enforcement to ensure a smooth transition to the new traffic signal.</p>\n<p>The plan received criticism from students in February, when former A.S. Senator Alex Giolito created a petition in opposition to the traffic light installation. The petition called for the termination of the project and urged alternative methods of controlling the busy intersection.</p>\n<p>County officials addressed the alternatives, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or channeling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V., but they ultimately deemed these solutions “too multilayered” to be practical.</p>\n<p>The county originally intended to install another traffic signal at the intersection between Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar but decided a signal at one intersection would create a sufficient break in the bike traffic.</p>\n<p>The county also considered installing a roundabout or a four-way stop at the intersection but determined it would not be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cultural change, and we’re in the heart of the community,” McGolpin said. “We think this one signal should be enough, and we wanted to have a softer touch on the community since we’re doing a signal for the first time in I.V.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Aug. 24, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily

it should be cheaper or even free.”</p>\n<p>Along with the $79.99 purchase of commencement regalia from the UCen Bookstore, which includes the graduation stole, tassel, cap and gown, the increased demand for lodging inflates the prices of hotels for families and friends.</p>\n<p>Frank Duffy, a manager at the Hampton Inn Santa Barbara/Goleta, said the hotel management increases room prices by about $100 per night for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson from the Kimpton Goodland accounting department said when demand increases, prices also increase based off the hotel’s capacity.</p>\n<p>A manager at the Goleta Courtyard Marriott also said they take the market price of hotel rooms into consideration when they set their prices.</p>\n<p>This price increase, however, does not seem to affect local Airbnbs because of the consistent shifts in supply and lodging capacity.</p>\n<p>According to an Airbnb press release with data from Smith Travel Research, the average cost of an Airbnb room was $162 in 2016, while the average price of a hotel room was $367.</p>\n<p>This data includes hotels only from the city of Santa Barbara, not the county.</p>\n<p>“Our hosts typically do not raise their prices. If they do, it’s very, very slightly,” said Jasmine Mora, an Airbnb spokesperson. “As a consumer you’re just not going to book that listing.”</p>\n<p>The lower prices are also because more hosts are signing up for Airbnb to rent out their rooms.</p>\n<p>According to Airbnb, 9 percent of users rented out Airbnb rooms for the first time during graduation weekend. This increase in supply helps to accommodate the increase in demand without over-inflating prices.</p>\n<p>However, not all travel and lodging services are increasing prices in preparation for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>Deanna Zachrisson, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Airport, said she did not see a correlation between graduation weekend and increased flight prices.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole number of factors that influence the prices of tickets,” she said. “It also can be the size of the aircraft … it’s really impossible to say that there’s a direct correlation between graduation traffic and cost.”</p>\n<p>Zachrisson also said college students make up a low percentage of the airport’s customers.</p>\n<p>Some graduation fees imposed by the university are charged only out of necessity, not to profit off of students.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Registrar charges an approximately $19 fee to every student graduating in order to process and send them their diplomas. The fee is an average rate to accommodate everyone, including those from smaller classes and international students that have more expensive shipping costs.</p>\n<p>She said diplomas for large graduating class sizes are cheaper than smaller class sizes because it is less expensive to buy in bulk.</p>\n<p>“It basically goes to cover the cost of the vendor for handling and mailing the diploma,” said the Uuniversity Registrar Leesa Beck. “You wouldn’t want someone to just drop your diploma in a manila envelope and drop it in a mailbox.”</p>\n<p>Beck said the diplomas are printed and sent by a third-party, out-of-state vendor.</p>\n<p>She also said it was “hard to say” if the total $19 goes directly to diplomas since the prices vary depending on graduating class and international shipping rates.</p>\n<p>Replacement diplomas are considerably more expensive at $50 domestically and $75 internationally, which Beck said was partly a “deterrent fee” meant to stop students from ordering multiple copies of their diploma, since they are only supposed to have one. She said this also works to prevent diploma fraud.</p>\n<p>Beck said if students can prove their diploma was lost or destroyed, the university frequently waives the fee.</p>\n<p>These costs only include the graduation essentials; however, an extra stole is sold at the Bookstore for $29.99 and a Classic Diploma Frame costs $150 and does not qualify for free shipping.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the June 8, 2017, print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

UCSB’s non-traditional graduating seniors have lived through the most testing experiences, trotting quietly but triumphantly to the commencement stage this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB defines a non-traditional student as someone who is either married, a parent, an undergraduate over 24 or a graduate student over 29.</p>\n<p>For most people, having a child at 17 can mean an obstacle course too difficult to overcome.</p>\n<p>As only 40 percent of teen mothers finish high school and fewer than 2 percent finish college by age 30, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the odds seem insurmountable for young parents. Statistics strongly suggest teen mothers have a trying time ahead of them on their path to education after pregnancy, one likely to end in failure.</p>\n<p>All of this is irrelevant to 20-year-old Hannah Cloe, aspiring novel writer, fiancée, mother to a three-year-old and soon-to-be UC Santa Barbara graduate.</p>\n<p>She is one of 5,770 UCSB graduating students set to shake the hand of Chancellor Henry T.

Despite beginning higher education in a S.T.E.M. field, Cloe said she realized it was not what she wanted to work in for a living.</p>\n<p>She has since been focusing on novel writing and plans to complete a manuscript after completing her senior thesis with English professor Chris Newfield. Her most recent work is about a hiker traveling the Appalachian Mountains.</p>\n<p>Cloe said she has a passion for “writing about the human experience” and dreams of completing an MFA in creative writing at Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Despite Cloe’s academic achievements, she once felt her life was over when she became pregnant at the age of 17. She said people she knew had told her that her life was over and it “certainly felt that way.”</p>\n<p>She said being a young mother has been difficult because of the stigma that people have over young parents.</p>\n<p>“I’ve once had a man say to me, ‘You shouldn’t be out here; you’re a bad example for my daughter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>But Cloe was not deterred.</p>\n<p>She enrolled as an English major at UCSB in 2016, taking over 21 units a quarter to complete her B.A. in one year. She wakes up at 6:30 a.m. every morning to prepare her three-year-old son, Hayden, for daycare and attending school full time.</p>\n<p>“And these people know nothing about my life; I’ve worked hard to go against what the odds were against me, and I’m proud to say I’ve almost done that,” she said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will say goodbye to many more students like Cloe who have overcome great odds and gone on to achieve incredible things.</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, 24, will also be walking this year to receive his bachelor’s degree in communication.</p>\n<p>He transferred from Santa Monica College and the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he admits having suffered depression. He said school in Boulder was difficult for him, and he struggled to deal with the new environments and people.</p>\n<p>Collins served as on-campus senator for the Associated Students (A.S.)

I am truly grateful for all of the opportunities coming my way.”</p>\n<p>The conference was free for the participants and their families thanks to AISA members raising the necessary funds.</p>\n<p>Bradford said their funding comes from “several partners across campus,” including the Chancellor’s and Vice Chancellor’s office, several academic and student affairs departments and A.S. organizations including Community Affairs Board, Student Commission on Racial Equality and Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Their main source of funding is the Student-Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), Bradford said. They also receive donations from various partners on and off campus.</p>\n<p>According to the 2016-17 UCSB Campus Profile, Native American students make up 1 percent of the graduate and undergraduate student population, and Bradford said there are currently about 240 self-identified Native American graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This means that these students self-identified on their applications when they were applying to UCSB,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>She also said, however, that there is no accurate way to identify the actual percentage of Native American students on campus because some students may be multiracial or multiethnic and choose to identify with other demographics when applying.</p>\n<p>Some students, she said, do not disclose their race or ethnicity because it is not required.</p>\n<p>“Some of our AISA members chose not to identify on the application … but of all the UC schools, we enroll the greatest number of self-identified American Indians,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>Bradford said the organization tabled at the S.T.E.M. Student Welcome day last year where members talked about Indigenous science and ways of taking action on campus in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline through fundraisers, honorings and activism.</p>\n<p>The group experienced record-high membership during the 2016-17 school year and attended a dinner with Student Affairs Staff to discuss Native American experiences in April.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, a first-year global and feminist studies double major of Arawak heritage, said it is comforting “to know that you’re not alone” as a Native American student.</p>\n<p>Meijer said everyone in the group is “incredibly welcoming,” and she hopes to become more involved throughout the rest of her undergraduate years.</p>\n<p>Meijer said it is difficult to mobilize more students because of the lack of Native American visibility and hopes to create more opportunities for Native American students as a newly elected Assembly District Delegate for the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“In America there are things that Native Americans go through and face that other people don’t necessarily recognize or think about,” Meijer said. “When you get into a group with other Native American students that realize this, it is very unifying because shared experiences and thoughts allow us to connect.”</p>\n<p>K’Ehleyr McNulty, an AISA member who will soon be graduating with degree in earth science, said AISA is the one place she can feel “worthy” of her own experiences and opinions.</p>\n<p>An Arizona native, McNulty said the organization has become an extension of her home and her Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Native American Nation during her time at UCSB. She said it has become a place where Native American students can find commonalities with one another in their heritage.</p>\n<p>She said she hopes the group will grow in the following years after she graduates in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is the one place I can feel myself the most on this campus,” McNulty said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-78383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The crew of six confronted great white sharks, April fog and uncharitable ships in their 13-mile journey across the Santa Barbara Channel to Anacapa Island. The one-way trip took eight hours. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>They had been training for months to trek the 13 miles across the channel, but nothing could prepare them for what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>The group launched at 8 a.m. from Channel Islands Beach in Oxnard and soon met several hiccups.</p>\n<p>To begin, the group had not weight-checked their kayaks prior to launching, and, as a result, some members capsized within the first few hours.</p>\n<p>They also discovered that the radios that they had brought were malfunctioning, which left the kayakers unable to call in for help in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a thick marine layer of fog that April morning made for especially low visibility. Byron Roos-Collins, fourth-year political science major, said the group could hardly see further than a mile ahead of them. Much of their trek across the channel incidentally followed a zigzag course.</p>\n<p>After paddling for several hours, the group of six reached the middle of the channel, a site of high traffic for cargo ships.</p>\n<p>As the kayakers waited for a cargo ship to pass, they spotted a dorsal fin emerge from the water approximately 20 feet away. It was a distinctly triangular fin jutting nearly three feet above the ocean surface, one that the kayakers knew could only belong to a great white shark.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen thousands and thousands of dolphins and whales, and this was neither of those,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>With the large freighters still passing by around them, the group found themselves unable to paddle away from the shark; they were stuck. The six kayakers had no choice but to stay put and prepare for the worst.</p>\n<p>Anticipating that the shark might mistake the kayaks for seals, the group put their kayaks together to form a larger vessel. Each person had a spear gun or buck knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Nik Frey, a UCSB alumnus who had recently returned from volunteering as a frontline medic in Mosul, Iraq, began giving the group instructions on how to apply a tourniquet, just in case anyone in the group lost an extremity in a bout with the shark. He also advised that, in the event of a shark attack, the kayakers stab the shark in its “sensitive face” rather than spearing it “willy-nilly.”</p>\n<p>When the freighters passed, the kayakers immediately took the opportunity to make a full charge toward the island. They only made it halfway across the shipping lanes when they spotted the dorsal fin of yet another great white shark.</p>\n<p>“That one was more disheartening I think,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the shark was uninterested and passed by the group.</p>\n<p>Spirits were low at this point, and the kayakers decided that they would wave down the next boat that passed them in hopes that it would rescue them.</p>\n<p>When a boat finally did pass by, the group waved their hands in the air and blew whistles to get the driver’s attention. Frey said the driver “must have seen” them, but the boat did not stop for them. The group was left “totally abandoned,” Frey said.</p>\n<p>“They gave us no love; they just kept on going,” Roos-Collins said. “It was pretty clear they had seen us.”</p>\n<p>Help was nowhere to be found, and the group knew they had no choice but to finish the trip. Establishing their compass angle again, the kayakers set off to reach Anacapa Island before the close of day.</p>\n<p>After a few hours more paddling through heavy fog, the kayakers were in close enough proximity to the island to see its ghostly shape. It was at this point, Frey said, that the group realized their incorrect compass angle nearly led them to miss the island entirely.</p>\n<p>The kayakers immediately corrected their bearings, pointing the tips of vessels toward the large land mass in the distance. With strong winds at their sides, however, the kayakers had to angle themselves in such a way that the wind would hit the tail of the kayak.</p>\n<p>“Coming to that island was glorious,” Frey said. “Being able to see the island was great. If we couldn’t see the island, then there’s a very likely chance we wouldn’t have made it.”</p>\n<p>The kayakers finally reached the shores of Anacapa Island at 4 p.m., approximately eight hours after first launching from Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Roos-Collins said their arrival greatly surprised the park ranger, who before that point was the only other person on the narrow archipelago composed mostly of jagged volcanic basalt. The primary occupants of the island were thousands of seagulls, highly aggressive during mating season.</p>\n<p>The group set up camp for the night in a site that they had reserved prior to embarking on the trip.

Supporters climbed a ladder on the side of the Co-op building to see the newly installed panels on the roof. Afterward, groups celebrated by cutting a giant ribbon with a pair of scissors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco-based nonprofit RE-volv started the Solar Ambassador Program as a way to help organizations and businesses switch to renewable energy. The one-year program takes college students and trains them in finance, management, crowdfunding and community engagement in a four-day retreat in Tomales Bay near San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv, said the ceremony was a way of raising awareness about renewable energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A project like this and a ribbon-cutting like this is [sic] really meant to show all the customers that come here, all the community members, all the students in Isla Vista at Santa Barbara, that solar power works,” Karelas said. “It saves the Co-op money, it can save you money and it’s something that we could all get behind and get involved with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Solar Ambassador team started their project in 2015. After signing the lease with the Co-op in the fall, the team raised $59,261 in donations during a crowdfunding campaign in the spring of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Godfrey, a fourth-year environmental studies major and one of the solar ambassadors, said she’s happy that the project is finished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited to see everything come to a close,” Godfrey said. “My favorite thing about the project was seeing the love and support that the community has for the Co-op. You don’t really see that until you tell them about something and then their face lights up, and it’s really awesome to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Solar Ambassador team commissioned Sun Pacific Solar Electric, a local solar contracting company, to build 100 solar panels capable of generating 24 kilowatts of energy each. The panels officially began supplying power on May 17 and have been able to generate approximately a third of the grocery store’s energy usage since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a 20-year lease term, the Isla Vista Food Co-op plans to pay off the cost of its solar panels gradually over time. Representatives from RE-volv said this current plan cuts the Co-op’s electricity bill by 15-percent.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78309\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78309\" data-attachment-id=\"78309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-05/i-v-food-co-op-takes-powerful-step-with-solar-panel-installation/dsc_0260/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0260\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Isla Vista Food Co-op installed solar panels, which now account for a third of the store’s electricity needs. <em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaylan Lamb, a fourth-year environmental studies major and the project leader, said the project was possible because of the cooperation among the different organizations and businesses.</span></p>\n<p>Lamb thanked the RE-volv representatives, Co-op staff and community members who supported the campaign “even when things got rocky.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[RE-volv representatives] were really our sponsors and guardians throughout the whole project and really gave us the motivation in the first place to spearhead the crowdfunding campaign to get the solar panels,” Lamb said. “The Co-op staff were so patient and so cooperative with us … It was really a group effort, and awesome to be able to bring everyone together and celebrate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the ribbon-cutting, a Co-op employee played a tune on the trumpet that was received with cheers from the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Brinker, the associate director of partnership and philanthropy at RE-volv, said the ceremony was personal for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This ceremony has a special place in my heart because I’m from Santa Barbara.

Environmental Affairs Board and the A.S. Food Bank budget. However, $11,259.98 came directly from A.S. funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former A.S. President Austin Hechler, who has been involved in the renovation since it was brought to A.S., spoke at the opening ceremony about how UC Santa Barbara continues to lead the fight against food insecurity for the entire UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler also commented that it’s “truly remarkable” how preeminent the food bank is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breanna Jones, A.S.
