According to Fischer, students and long-term residents complained about the bench’s constant occupation, noting that it deteriorated the curb appeal of the intersection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the bench was removed and broken into “a whole bunch of pieces,” according to Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould. Following the removal of the bench, Gould said the Public Works Department approached the IVRPD, asking if they would like to keep the pieces.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had an offer to receive all these slabs of stone and big boulders and we said, ‘Yes, please, we’ll take them,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD had the Public Works Department deliver the pieces to the Sueno Bark Park, where they plan to permanently keep the benches after they are rebuilt, according to Gould. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD plans to “reconstruct [the bench] into two, probably three separate smaller benches,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is currently no plan to have an unveiling for the new benches, Gould said the IVRPD plans to have them finished before May 18, the day of their planned “Bark Party” at the Sueno Bark Park. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On May 18, we’re having an event in the dog park called ‘Bark Party.’ We’ve got ‘Care For Paws’ out there doing free or discounted immunizations for dogs and Pet Smart’s giving away coupons and stuff.

Bluffs Report released in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed changes to the I.V. Bluff Policy follow an instance in which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\">15 feet of the cliff between 6653 and 6663 Del Playa Drive collapsed</a> in a short period in January 2017, according to the report. This collapse forced out 28 residents from the surrounding properties after a portion of the balcony crumbled off the cliff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This “single-event failure” — an event where the most cliff erosion occurs in a single point in time, as opposed to erosion over time — exceeded the current requirement of five feet and “raised concern regarding the current policy for structure setbacks, which includes an assumption that a single bluff failure will be no more than five feet,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all properties would be affected by the new proposal, Abolhoda noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to site-specific conditions of property, the threshold distance can be different for each property, depending on the type of foundation of the building, how close the building is to the property line and how close the south side of the building is to the cliff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property owners would be able to submit geotechnical evaluation reports to sidestep having to make renovations or cutbacks to the building, so long as the building meets the division’s requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we know that site-to-site situations can vary, we are asking that property owners hire a geotechnical engineer to evaluate their specific condition and let us know,” Abolhoda said. “[They can then] offer us a geotechnical report if they believe the 15 feet that would be the basis of our new policy is not really applicable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we get that report, we get other geotechnical engineers to review it and see if it’s acceptable, and if it’s acceptable then the policy would be based on a single event that is going to happen in that specific site. That’s how our policies are being revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with shallow foundations, about 24 to 32 inches deep, would be less likely to meet the division’s building safety requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with caisson foundations in good shape have a better chance of sliding by the new policy, but a “series of triggers” would be established to monitor the integrity of the foundation and the safety of the building over time. The triggers would designate points in erosion which would render the support structures ineffective and require property owners to address the conditions of the building at that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building is less than 15 feet from the bluff, the property would be placed on a watch list to be “monitored on a continuing basis for bluff retreat and building proximity,” according to the report. The property owners would also be notified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can adjust our policy according to what is considered the most prevalent single-event failure that can be experienced on that site,” Abolhoda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building comes within 10 feet of the bluff, the property owner will be issued an official “Notice of Violation” and will be required to address the “noncompliant conditions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing is done to address the threshold violation, the property owner would be fined and receive a “Notice of Non-Compliance,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the event that a building  comes within five feet of the bluff, the property owner may be issued a “Notice and Order to Vacate Building and Abate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is determined that the property does not meet the safety threshold, the property owner has several options.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The owner can “cut the building back a minimum of 30 feet,” but would also be allowed to do smaller cutbacks on a “case-by-case basis.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They could also maintain the building in its current condition if a geotechnical engineering report proves the building is safe to live in. Property owners would still need a “monitoring and abatement plan” prepared by a civil or structural engineer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third option is foundation strengthening, which could also allow property owners to maintain the existing structure through the “underpinning of shallow foundations,” anchoring of existing foundations or other methods, according to the report. Property owners would need reports from geotechnical and structural engineers to oversee the modifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building and safety division is holding a meeting with property owners on May 2 at the planning commission room on 123 E Anapamu Street to discuss concerns and “have a discussion about moving forward with new policy,” Abolhoda said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not rushing to this, and we want everyone to understand what we are asking, and we do not want to create a false panic,” Abolhoda said. “Safety is the primary reason for this change of policy.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself with some free time and extra cash this Saturday, April 27, stop by the Isla Vista Market at Little Acorn Park at 6747 El Embarcadero from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The casual open-air market will host local vendors selling everything from vintage clothing, handmade jewelry and ceramics to biodegradable glitter, stickers and art. There will even be services such as eyebrow threading. Over 30 vendors will be putting their goods on display, with some taking Venmo for payment, too. Isla Vista Trading Post will also have their shop set up and will be allowing patrons to pick out three pieces of clothing for free.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1233084290181051/\"><b>Soundcheck </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some say that the best bands are formed solely by chance. For bands playing at the 2019 Band Lottery Showcase, that’s exactly what happened. About a month ago, Biko Garage Funzone hosted an event where musicians looking to form a group could meet up and be randomly sorted into new bands. Now, some of those bands are returning to Biko Garage at 6612 Sueno Road on Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. to put their new grooves to the test. At least two of the bands are scheduled to play, and Isla Vistans can drop in throughout the night to support some of the newest local music in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/279842549625140/\"><b>Down with Capitalism </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who ever said communism is dead? Definitely not a couple of bands slated to play at Communist Mothers Music Collective this Saturday, April 17 at 8 p.m. Local bands Careless Cub and Aqua Stalin will be providing the tunes for a night of condemning capitalism among comrades. If you’ve got a bone to pick with the system, this is the party for you. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/319398622107660/\"><b>Yoga for the Soul </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mantra Lounge Kirtan Santa Barbara and Yoga Isla Vista host an evening of Kirtan Yoga for community members to gather, shed the stresses of the day and unwind with meditative music.

The case alleges that Shehadeh owes Icon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ikes-lawsuit.pdf\">more than $42,000 in overdue rent</a>, according to public records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reached out to both Icon’s leasing office and its legal team several times, but did not receive any comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a separate interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shehadeh said he recently filed a countersuit against Icon, alleging that “[Icon] did some things that we didn’t appreciate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh’s countersuit alleges that Icon breached his lease agreement and committed fraud in the form of concealment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a court document sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Shehadeh’s attorney, the countersuit alleges that Icon hid important information following a situation involving mold on the premises, resulting in the eventual litigation currently taking place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After informing Icon in January of 2018 that he would no longer be leasing the store, “Icon negotiated with Ike’s Place to amend the lease” and remain in I.V., according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that following the repair of a faulty hose in the soda dispenser at the I.V. location, Icon, “unbeknownst to Ike’s Place… hired ATC Group Services LLC to perform a mold inspection in the neighboring property…” that same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that same week, ATC Group Services allegedly reported that the mold found on the premises was coming from Shehadeh’s store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report claimed that the faulty hose was to blame for the mold but, allegedly, nobody from ATC Group Services contacted the store to inform Shehadeh there was a presence of mold on the premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the court document alleges that Icon had knowledge of mold on the premises prior to the faulty hose in the I.V. location’s soda dispenser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soda dispensary machine at the I.V. location had allegedly been inspected just “weeks prior” and the health inspector “did not find any issues with that machine,” according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Shehadeh entered negotiations between Jan. 19 of 2018 and Jul. 4 of 2018 to extend his lease with Icon, the leasing agency allegedly “did not disclose this mold report to Ike’s Place,” according to the court document: “had Ike’s Place known that Icon intended to blame mold damages in the Premises upon Ike’s place, then Ike’s Place would have been able to obtain contemporaneous evidence that it was not responsible for said damages.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh eventually decided to terminate his lease with Icon during the negotiation period but received an email in which Icon offered to “modify the amendment for the reduced gross rent,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within weeks, Shehadeh agreed to extend the lease, ending negotiations with Icon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegedly, “almost immediately” after Shehadeh signed the extended lease, Icon began inspections to “establish the presence of mold that it was already aware existed but had not disclosed to Ike’s Place,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that “Intrusive remedial work” was performed on the I.V. store following the inspection, ceasing store operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, biohazard signs were scattered throughout the store, bathrooms were closed, the kitchen was sealed off and the I.V. location was unable to make and serve sandwiches, according to the court document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ike’s place was unable to continue to do business at the level it previously did and was accordingly unable to pay rent,” the court document states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leaving the I.V. store uninformed about the mold, the court document alleges, Icon breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it concealed material facts from Ike’s place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. store claims, in the court document, that it was “harmed” by Icon due to its reliance on false information the leasing agency provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Icon’s suppression of material facts was malicious and egregious such that Icon should be liable for punitive damages,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document adds that the I.V. location is seeking compensation for “punitive damages,” the cost of the suit, attorney’s fees and “general, special, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or economic damages…”</span></p>\n<p><b>New State Street Store:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new shop slated to open next week, Shehadeh circumvented the short hiring window by offering all current employees at the I.V location a chance to work at the new store. Furthermore, the store will be managed by one of Ike’s first-ever managers, who will bring roughly 10 years of experience to the new sandwich parlor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Street location is equipped with a parking lot, which allows for a full-size catering menu, decreased wait times for delivery and parking for both employees and customers, according to Shehadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Shehadeh also plans to keep the lights on late into the night, flirting with new store hours such as “10 to 10” on weekdays and “10 to midnight” on weekends. However, the hours will be adjusted according to demand, as Shehadeh finds that there’s no use in staying open if nobody wants to purchase food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further compensate for the move, Shehadeh is excited to offer a “super student discount,” where both Santa Barbara City College and UC Santa Barbara students can tack on chips and a drink to their meal for “a buck fifty.”</span></p>\n<p>The court filings in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biography is the culmination of decades of work, Stewart said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart began research on Locke in 1977 while in graduate school at Yale University. He dropped the project for a long period of time but resumed writing the biography in 1992.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went away from it because it was so challenging … It was a very complex project. I didn’t feel like early on, coming out of graduate school, I could write the book. I had to grow as a writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart made use of Howard University’s exhaustive collection of Locke’s personal correspondences to paint a picture of Locke’s philosophy, life experiences, conflicts and interpersonal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professor at Howard University, Locke left the bulk of his letters with the institution, where they were compiled in the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart pored over thousands of documents in the process of writing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He has voluminous letters. He had probably 5000 letters to his mother alone… He would report on what he did and where he went almost like a diary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike historical counterparts such as Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on social advancement through economic efficacy and protest respectively, Locke looked at the arts and saw an opportunity to connect white audiences with Black creators, Stewart said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s like a facilitator. He’s like a producer of these things. He did it out of a belief that art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke popularized the works of Black artists and authors such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and others who “started doing poems and short stories and novels about the Black experience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that “art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost like a Trojan Horse, [art] could be rode into the citadel of American culture and there would be poetry and art and all about Black people which would humanize how people thought about Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke faced challenges relating to his disposition, his size, his sexuality and his focus on art over other forms of activism. In the greater Black cultural narrative, Stewart believes Locke was overlooked because of these peculiarities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take somebody like Frederick Douglass. He’s independent, a leader, a spokesperson. He’s heterosexual, he has a family. It’s like it’s the mirror of the white world, but Black. Locke was small. He was 4’11″. He weighed 99 pounds. He was into art, which is not typically the focus of Black politics. He was a difficult personality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke’s challenges gave him a unique perspective on life, and his success and resilience in the face of dismissiveness from other activists inspired Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never let the opposition from other people stop him, whether it was gendered or sexual, or racial, or even the issue of his size, or those people who thought that art was ridiculous to be concerned about when you’re in the midst of a racial struggle.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87719\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1536383264\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87708\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87719\" data-attachment-id=\"87719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-professor-wins-pulitzer-prize/unnamed-1-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"335,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=335%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also significant to Stewart was Locke’s faith in the Black cultural capacity for change and reinvention, away from the ideals and standards imposed by white people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that in altering one’s conception of oneself and embracing one’s innate qualities as a Black person, one could “acquire and gain a sense of self-esteem and agency that [one could] never acquire by trying to get what the other people have,” Stewart said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So there’s a narrative of self-sufficiency and self-determination through art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke also led a life of lonesomeness which intensified after the death of the most prominent figure in Locke’s life: his mother.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of his life was after her death in 1922, a search for someone to replace her… and he never found that,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was coupled with a desire for a meaningful relationship with a man, which Locke could never fulfill, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had relationships but never anything that was really permanent. He felt people would get with him because of what he could do for them, they used him. He was a means, not an end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke was a perpetual optimist deep down, even in his dying moments. In every aspect of his life, whether it be romantic pursuits, academic ambitions or social activism, Locke never let seemingly insurmountable disadvantages discourage him, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart believes young people can learn from Locke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That kind of relates to today, I think. A lot of young people come out and look at the situation. There’s a lot of controversy… but [Locke] was always hopeful, always thinking that by contributing you could make a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This signature concept of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The New Negro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Black people reinvented themselves in the 20th century, away from slavery… There’s this idea that wherever you are in your life, whatever has happened, you still have the capacity for a new version of yourself,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His whole thing is, well, if you believe you can change, then maybe you can.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Senate, taking 12 of the 23 seats on the table. The Isla Vista Party won 10 seats, while the last seat went to engineering candidate Diana Reyes Carrillo, who ran independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be no College of Creative Studies (CCS) senator and no fifth on-campus senator in the 70th Senate due to a shortage of candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of senator-elects can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/live-a-s-election-results-2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notable victory from tonight’s election was that of College of Letters &amp; Science Senator-elect Justice Dumlao. He previously lost twice in A.S. elections – once as an External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate in 2016-2017 and again in the 2017-2018 presidential race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 32.34% of the undergraduate student body voted in this year’s election, compared to 39.7% of last year. According to the A.S. Elections Board, 6,980 students undergraduate students voted in this year’s election, as opposed to the 8,233 who voted in the 2017-2018 election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/a-s-elections-sees-increase-in-voter-turnout/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first year since 2015</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that voter turnout has dropped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a third-year political science major, is UCSB’s first female Asian-American president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am just so grateful to actually represent the community, my community, the Asian American community,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so blessed that I have so much support… The night went really well and I am really proud of everyone that was able to win and feel the experience of running. I am very proud of Zion running too, we are both women of color and I am very proud… for what we both did. I am excited to do a lot of good work and [make] tangible change.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race between External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidates Christian Ornelas and Matthew Griffin came the closest. With 3,012 votes, Ornelas narrowly defeated Griffin, who earned 2,915, by a margin of 97 votes – a mere 1.6%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to A.S. Legal Code, “A recount shall be given whenever the difference between the Candidates is two percent (2%) or less of the votes cast for the office; or whenever evidence of an erroneous count is shown and called to the attention of the Elections Board Chairperson or the Senate within one (1) week (seven (7) days) after the vote has been announced.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a potential recount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that I have really big shoes to fill, so I’m excited to start working with Jeike, start having our transition meetings, just to really make sure that I can live up to all the work that she’s done because she’s done a lot for this campus,” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President-elect Alli Adam ran unopposed after her would-be opponent, Yash Nagpal, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/isla-vista-party-will-not-run-internal-vice-president-candidate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dropped out of the race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during Week 1 of Spring Quarter, citing health concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has a bright future for 2019-2020, and that’s all I have to say,” Adam, a third-year political science major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Nguyen was also unopposed in his race for Student Advocate General. Nguyen ran for an off-campus Senate seat with Campus United during the 2017-2018 school year and served on the 69th Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect Daevionne Beasley defeated Isla Vista Party candidate Alexandra Leal Silva by a margin of 513 votes. Beasley, a second-year sociology major, emphasized that he wants to continue working with Leal Silva during his EVPSA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m most excited to reach out to [Leal Silva] and see exactly what ideas she has from working in the EVPSA office these last three years … I know that she was so instrumental in keeping the office going when there was no EVPSA, I really need her input and insight,” Beasley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reached out to each other before and we said that no matter the results, we’d work with each other and I hope that continues and that the sentiment was real, and I can’t wait to see where both of our ideas will take us forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All fee reaffirmations passed, and the sole new fee on the ballot – a fee for the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) – also passed with 64.93% of the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most A.S. elections, the days leading up to the final results were filled with contentious jabs between the two parties, but it was the day of elections when A.S.

know about its inner workings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fact that candidates run on a platform of accessibility to Associated Students (A.S.) during A.S. elections

</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two students are trying to change that — and no, not two students who are already heavily involved in A.S.

Simren Verma / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Steinhorn, a third-year communication major, and Adri Davies, a third-year political science major, have been close friends since their freshman year when they were matched as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two got the idea to start a podcast about the lack of knowledge students have about A.S. during a class they took together last quarter: Writing for Public Discourse (105PD), an upper-division writing class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final project in the class was to put together an advocacy campaign, and Steinhorn and Davies decided to create a 30-minute podcast titled “Apathy Unveiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, this first episode of “Apathy Unveiled” is the only podcast the two have created but they plan to make more about A.S. and even expand to new topics, such as UCSB’s Greek system and national politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know a lot of the stuff that we ended up reporting on and covering until we started doing the research,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I think a lot of it also stemmed from our own curiosity about A.S. elections and how A.S. works.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the beginning of the podcast, Steinhorn spoke to how UCSB students seem to care about national politics, but not A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has one of the highest student voting populations out of public universities,” Steinhorn said. “But somehow, we have failed… to even get half the student body to vote in any recent [A.S.] elections.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn’s and Davies’ perspectives differ from that of current A.S. elected officials and candidates. Many students – including those currently running in the Spring Quarter 2019 elections – emphasize that the student body is unaware of A.S.’s budget due to a lack of transparency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies disagree. They find the root of the problem to be apathetic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Steinhorn and Davies began researching for the podcast, they decided to look into A.S.’s level of transparency for themselves and ended up finding A.S.’s budget almost immediately, Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue is not that we don’t have information or that it’s not transparent,” Davies said in the podcast. “You Google UCSB A.S. budget and it’s like the second link.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have no idea what’s going on, students that do run for positions know that they can get away with whatever they want basically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies then went on in the podcast to discuss the disqualification of former External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA)-elect Mayela Morales and the subsequently vacant EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has tried to elect a new representative, and we have continually not been able to get enough student voters to allow that representative into their position,” Steinhorn said in the podcast, referring to the failed A.S. special elections held this past school year in an attempt to elect an EVPSA.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn re-emphasized that she believes the reason behind the vacant EVPSA position is largely due to apathetic students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies spent a bulk of the podcast, however, arguing that many students do not know the reality of how much money A.S. controls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy to attribute inaction to the lack of transparency, but then when we found that there was a lot of transparency… it’s like, okay then, what is the actual problem?” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “That kind of led us to talking to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies clarified that she believes it is hard to understand what happens inside of A.S. and what exactly is on A.S. elected officials’ agendas, noting that it is the budget and the financial information that she thinks is transparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn and Davies asked UCSB students what they knew about A.S. and how much money they thought the A.S. budget was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student guessed $20,000, and another guessed $500,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of them missed the mark by a longshot. Steinhorn and Davies told each student they interviewed that A.S.’s budget for this school year was $13.8 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students responded with gasps, one exclaimed “Oh my god!” and one even said, “For what? What do they do?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies also asked the students if they knew how much each student individually pays A.S. with their fees and asked the students if they knew that the A.S. executive elected officials get most of their tuition paid through honoraria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with interviewing students not involved in A.S., they also interviewed an A.S. insider, who wanted to remain anonymous, and asked the insider to explain what exactly A.S. is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’ve noticed on this campus is there is a small group of people who are politically engaged, and they end up determining a lot of student-wide issues… that not necessarily a majority of students would want,” the A.S. insider said during the podcast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the theme of apathy, Steinhorn and Davies stressed that they believe there is an issue of accessibility to A.S. Although they think that students can do more, they also believe that A.S. can do more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people probably view university government as more of a club than a body that actually makes decisions,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s kind of like this selective group. It seems, at least from the outside, hard to break in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies then joined in on expressing her frustration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are these people being picked? Who’s doing this? Is it like… you have to do this fellowship, and then you’re kind of bred in? It’s really strange. I’ve always just been… questioning it all,” Davies added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Steinhorn and Davies believe all students should feel obligated to make their voices heard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By saying that students are the issue, we’re also saying that students are the solution,” Davies said in the podcast, encouraging students to be informed voters.</span></p>\n<p>The podcast in full can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ApathyUnveiledFinal-2-%E2%80%93-Podcast.mov\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-87716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The program was announced at the April 23 meeting of the I.V. CSD. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A designated sober party monitor is alerted through telephone if SBSO receives a noise complaint about the party. The monitor then has 20 minutes to shut down the party and lower noise levels, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/sheriffs-office-announces-iv-party-registration-program/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO on Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is intended to foster a partnership between residents and police, allowing party hosts to remedy noise complaints without the need for a police response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy for Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), announced the launch of the program at the April 23 meeting of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a complaint is received, we then call or text that person and they have 20 minutes to mitigate that noise problem themselves without a police response. So our slogan for that is, ‘Get a text, not a ticket,’” said Schroeder at the I.V. CSD meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we’re hoping people utilize that program, just to kind of foster a more community-oriented policing method out here in Isla Vista, and we hope it’s a popular program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Party Registration Program has been in Schroeder’s plans since his <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\">instatement</a> as Community Resource Deputy back in November 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think the students realize there’s like families and young kids that live in Isla Vista. We have some families that call every single night about a noise complaint,” Schroeder said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program builds on Schroeder’s goals of constructing a community-policing model and bridging the gap between law enforcement and community members. The program allows I.V. residents to monitor themselves, without the need for police intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar programs are also in effect in cities around the country. San Luis Obispo’s adoption of this program has been successful at California Polytechnic State University, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must follow a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IV-party-registration-guidlines2.pdf\">set of guidelines</a> in order to register a party with the program. Parties must be registered at least 48 hours in advance and can only be registered for Fridays and Saturdays, as well as Sunday if the following Monday is a holiday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police will be dispatched if contact cannot be made with the party monitor, and a citation will be issued if noise violations are verified. A citation will also be issued if a second complaint is received by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properties will also lose registration privileges for nine months if complaints are received for two separate parties within nine months of each other. Individuals who have received a noise violation citation or a social host ordinance violation cannot register for the program for nine months after the last violation occurred. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, people who have received a public nuisance party citation cannot register with the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Juan Camarena of the IVFP also believes that the program will create a clearer line of communication between I.V. residents and law enforcement, along with establishing a safe environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program embraces the idea of community-oriented policing and partners community members with law enforcement to solve the problem of noise complaints in Isla Vista,” Camarena said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also creates an open line of communication between the community and law enforcement, shows transparency and cooperation, and encourages future partnerships to solve other crimes.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Graduate Student Association (APIGSA) and the Asian American Studies Department spoke about their experiences at the university and grievances they hold with the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers talked about the lack of resources allocated for Asian and Asian American students on campus, with some noting that almost one third of UCSB’s student population identifies as Asian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smita Narasimhan, social media coordinator for Pan Asian Network, talked about the failure of the university to recognize the many identities within the label of Asian or Asian American. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from so many diverse cultures, languages, religions and we need to embrace all of that, but by designating all of us under one umbrella with one word, that’s taking all those differences away,” Narasimhan said during the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narasimhan said she hopes the fulfillment of the demands will create a campus where her Asian identity will be acknowledged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe at the end of this, I can feel comfortable calling myself Asian again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor of Asian American studies, also spoke at the rally, urging students to “mobilize and organize” to create the changes needed for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fujino said that not only do the 2019 demands

marched into Cheadle Hall and chanted in protest while ascending the stairs to the fifth floor, where Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Executive Assistant in the Office of the Chancellor Diane O’Brien received the list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pan Asian Network members then listed the staff they required to be present at the meeting and requested that a meeting to discuss the demands with the Chancellor Henry T. Yang be held on Friday, May 3.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said the demands and the request for the meeting would be passed on to Chancellor Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the meeting date is not fulfilled, Pan Asian Network and other groups plan to take stronger action to compel the university to meet their demands, according to Donna Anderson, member of APIGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If that doesn’t happen, if Chancellor Yang is unable to make that possible, then it turns into direct action. It’s gonna be more rallies, more advocacy, greater activism on campus and we won’t be silent. We’re not gonna let this go,” Anderson said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Anderson, the demands come down to an essential problem with how the Asian and Asian-American communities are seen on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are invisible. Our needs aren’t being met and people just assume that we’re gonna be okay because it is a reinforcement of the model minority idea that Asian and Asian-American students are gonna make do.

CSD include graffiti abatement, an AmeriCorps partnership and a resource center for survivors of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director and former president Ethan Bertrand gave the floor to those attending after he explained the budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), proposed funding be directed toward peer advocates for Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA). Peer advocates help survivors of sexual assault navigate their options and are required to undergo 60 hours of training beforehand, according to Reynolds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education Center (C.A.R.E.) funds the training for UCSB students but not for volunteers outside of UCSB. SASA recommends funding be directed toward establishing training as a paid position, so as to compensate volunteers for their time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member also proposed the money be used to create a community counseling center for drug addiction, homelessness and suicide intervention, along with a mental health assessment survey of Isla Vista, in which a survey would be sent out to gauge the mental health of I.V. residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also multiple complaints by people concerning the difficulty of negotiating with landlords, leading to discussion about a greater need for tenant resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public safety was a large concern among many in attendance. The need for better lighting, particularly in the farther reaches of I.V., was voiced by several attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis believes a greater community voice is needed for change to happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say, you know, there’s a member of our board that’s really interested in lighting and leading the charge to get better lighting out here and we’ve done the survey and stuff. But the one thing the community can do is be louder that the lighting is insufficient here,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve met with officials that say, ‘Ah, it’s been like that. We can’t do that.’ No. This is what the community wants, and I think we need to make that message clear.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency preparedness was another problem that was raised. Attention was then brought to the Thomas Fire and the lack of communication surrounding it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggestions were made to keep Deltopia local and quiet, so as to not attract outsiders. One solution was raised to have a community festival, but attracting more out-of-towners was still a concern. Planning Deltopia into being a more controlled event is a primary goal for I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unable to attend the public forum budget meeting, project proposals can also be </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTTQt6hc1sAxwWpX94fvHhte7EaAPTT1euio6enUPZqCfCeg/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitted online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary version of the budget will be released at the <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/9590f8912/4_23_2019+Regular+Meeting+Agenda-2.pdf\">next I.V.

Following his first year, he said he  “began to continue to fall in love with our community and work closely with the I.V. CRC, the Teen Center and Community Services District.” Furthermore, Griffin also worked to help students who were displaced by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliff collapses on Del Playa Drive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also owns his own aerial photography company where he takes pictures for “landlords and property management services.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, a current off-campus senator, stated he is already working closely with the EVPLA office and is close friends with the current EVPLA, Jeike Meijer. Through his connections with the EVPLA and the office, Ornelas said “[Meijer is] constantly helping me learn more about her office and just the kind of work [that the] EVPLA should be doing, and how the EVPLA can be responsive to community needs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on representing the diversity of the I.V. community, as “we are representing a diverse amount of people, both students and non-students… so it’s really important that you’re able to connect with different communities because we all share Isla Vista and it’s really pertinent to make sure that their voices are uplifted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One question posed by Elections Board referenced Wi-Fi in I.V. Parks; despite previous efforts, the implementation of free Wi-Fi in the parks has yet to see any tangible progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas provided two possible solutions: build routers into park benches or take advantage of “innovative companies that utilize satellites to ping Wi-Fi to certain areas.” However, Ornelas does not guarantee he will be able to make either of these undertakings happen, noting that the term length is not favorable to larger projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin, on the other hand, believes this may be a better job for the I.V. CSD, where he has already established “creative relationships” with some of the directors, such as Father Jon Hedges. Griffin finds that the I.V. CSD would be a more appropriate place to take on the project because they have the “space for transition projects” which can be implemented over the “course of a few years,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are familiar with the I.V. CSD, the local government representing I.V. But Griffin has worked closely with current I.V. CSD directors Ethan Bertrand and Spencer Brandt in the past; Ornelas admitted that he hasn’t “been super involved in their [I.V. CSD] meetings,” but plans to be more involved in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brought up by the Elections Board, community outreach is a cornerstone of the EVPLA position, as it is imperative to take into account the diversity of I.V. while also acting as a liaison between the community and the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, who speaks fluent Spanish, stressed the importance of having a diverse office and proposed the idea of creating a community outreach team to better connect with the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community outreach has a different meaning to Griffin, who has spent the past two years curating a series of interviews with long-term residents of I.V. called “The People of Isla Vista.” Griffin plans to continue this work, if elected, so he can devise a way to produce more inclusive programs that stretch out to those not necessarily affiliated with the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a contentious issue that seems to never be completely remediated, is seen as a problem by both Ornelas and Griffin, although their solutions are not the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having had worked with the EVPLA office in the past, Griffin sees street lighting as a project for the I.V. CSD – one in which the EVPLA can help supplement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My plan would be to work with them [I.V. CSD]… to go out and find where more lights need to be implemented. And then working with the county and other organizations come up with a concrete plan to install lights in areas that are not fairly lit,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, on the other hand, is a fan of the ongoing efforts of the EVPLA office and its recent release of a street lighting expansion </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ornelas believes the work should remain in the office to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and restarting the project somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas also plans to collaborate with county supervisor Joan Hartmann to “represent our voices at the county level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an increase in attendance but a decrease in arrests, the elections board asked if it may be possible to remove Deltopia’s festival ordinance in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates agree that instead of abandoning the ordinance entirely, it should be adjusted and scaled down accordingly. Furthermore, Ornelas is weary that if Deltopia becomes a sanctioned, “actual event,” there is the possible repercussion that visitors from other colleges might see the change as a potential advertisement to draw attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is opposed to advertising Deltopia as a real event as well, fearing that it will draw crowds from other schools who see it as an “exclusive event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board also asked if the candidates believe the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community naloxone trainings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> implemented in I.V. have been successful in helping residents learn how to use naloxone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are in favor of seeing the program expand more. Ornelas, who has attended a training, plans to push for Community Service Officers (CSOs) to also have naloxone on hand, as they currently do not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about their plans to fight against sexual assault, Griffin and Ornelas proposed different approaches to the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas believes the best approach is to listen to the needs of the community. He also cited “really close relationships with folks in students against sexual assault” and the fact that Standing Together To End Sexual Assault (STESA), a college advocate program for sexual assault survivors, recently approached the I.V CSD for funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin plans to work directly with the I.V. CSD to implement more Green Dot trainings, which help educate students on sexual assault and violence. On top of that, Griffin also hopes to bring the Blue Light system to I.V., which he believes will make the community feel safer at night and speed up police response times by having numerous emergency alarms around I.V. that will alert police if activated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last on the list of questions was the subject of food insecurity and its disproportionate effect on marginalized students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on strengthening the services of the A.S. Food Bank and CalFresh. As a vice chair on A.S. Finance and Business, Orneals stated that “there’s honestly a lot of room for improvement in how money can be used more efficiently. So really making sure that we’re reevaluating the budget and allocating that to programs that people really need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is in favor of expanding the services of the A.S. Food Bank because he feels “not everybody can access it or not everybody knows about it, who is food insecure.” He would also like to work with local grocery stores to create a food bank that gives nearly-expired food for free to students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because there are five on-campus senatorial seats available, but only four candidates running, all of them will secure a spot, bringing the number of senators on the 70th Senate to 23 rather than the usual 24.

Austin Foreman, a first-year pre-biology major and Emma Swanson, a first-year physics major, are running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaz and Swanson did not attend the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The questions asked by Elections Board and answered by the candidates are below: </span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first priority be if elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said his first priority would be to implement a committee that would create a digital library of textbooks so students wouldn’t have to purchase textbooks every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would make sure Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has more “initiative to reduce the waitlist times.” </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system with campaigning affect the way you take office? Will you be able to work effectively with members of the other party? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said polarization is a “huge issue” in the Senate, and said it’s important to be bipartisan and make sure senators are “reaching the needs of the student body instead of being focused on just our parties.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said this will not be an issue. He said he would work to fulfill students’ needs regardless of party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>For someone who is unfamiliar with the way A.S. works and what an on-campus senator does, could you explain what you do and what do you plan to do once you take office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman explained that students each pay approximately $600 toward A.S., which makes up a total budget of about $14 million. He said he is looking to use the money toward fixing the bike paths and implementing a system to maintain the paths, as well as increasing funding for mental health resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas echoed Foreman’s explanation of what A.S. is, adding that senators write bills and resolutions that focus on helping students’ needs. She said she would love to work on implementing workshops in all the dorm halls that would address financial aid, mental health, anti-blackness and “anything to the needs of the students that I think would really help them branch out and understand how to navigate college life.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times first years or even fourth years people can struggle with the stress of college life or guilt for not being there to pay and provide for their families. But I think it’s really important that if this happens or if a student is struggling, that they are referred to a program or know about the resources they have here at UCSB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Serving on the Senate is an extremely large time commitment. Just last week Senate had a meeting that ran for over 10 hours. Senators are expected to be present at various BCU meetings and have several other responsibilities as well. If you are elected, do you believe you will be able to dedicate yourself to the position and the time commitment that is needed? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she will dedicate her time and effort to the Senate, as well as the Boards Commissions &amp; Units (BCU) meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m the type of leader who doesn’t overpower voices. I’m the type of leader who would love to sit down with a person and talk and hear their needs and the responsibilities they believe the A.S. Senate should have. In order to implement that, that requires time and effort… I want others to tell me what they need from me and work and collaborate with them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he will be able to fulfill the time commitment required, stating he is very “time management oriented.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also look forward to sitting on Senate regardless of the length of the meeting and following and learning the procedures of Senate… I love to liason for meetings and learn about all the different organizations on our campus and the diversity and what they wish to see in Senate.” </span></p>\n<p><b>This past year, the price to live in a double room with a 14 meal plan increased by approximately $500 dollars. What will you do to address increasing costs and make living in the dorms more affordable for on-campus students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he believes financial security is a “very important issue that is pressing our students at the moment.” He admitted that he is “not very educated on the cost of dorm living and the meal plan increase” but said he hopes to be educated on that once he takes his Senate seat. He repeated his plan to implement the open-source textbook program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said the rising cost of tuition is a “really prevalent problem.” To address this, she said meals swipes should be transferable and shared among students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Reports of on-campus sexual assault and dating violence have been on the rise during recent years. What would you do to address sexual violence on campus, and most importantly, how would you support and advocate for survivors?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would like to implement a faster emergency response system, so when students are walking from the library to Isla Vista, or from Isla Vista to the dorms, there is an “earlier response to their needs.” She added that she would like to implement a policy that would enforce harsher punishment on assaulters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said that he, along with other Campus United candidates, want to implement a Blue Light system in I.V. He added that there should be an office on campus that survivors can go to and speak to someone about what happened to them, and report on the issue “so that it can be addressed and that the assaulter be reprimanded and [so] that it does not happen again.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any leadership or work experience relating to UCSB Housing and Dining? For example, experience with RHA, or a job in the dorms, or the dining commons. If you do, how would you use your past experience to help you in your new position. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he is the Queer-Trans Student engagement chair in the Santa Catalina South Hall council. In that position, he works to “create space spaces where people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, and all factors can come and enjoy themselves and express themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would take this experience and bring that to Senate and make it a place where diversity is welcomed and can thrive,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she does not have an experience with UCSB housing or dining, but said she has experience as an intern for CalPerg and worked on the affordable textbooks campaign. She added that she has experience in Hermanas Unidas. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.
