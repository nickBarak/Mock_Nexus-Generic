Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

The semester will now end one week later on May 19. Westmont College canceled classes from Jan. 6 through Jan. 12. The campus reopened Monday, Jan. 15.</p>\n<p>The heavy rains and mudslides in Montecito have caused <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at least 20 deaths</a>. Four people are still missing.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire weakened the ground in Montecito, making it <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/evacuation-orders-issued-as-winter-storm-threatens-potential-flooding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">susceptible to flooding</a> and unable to absorb the water from last week’s storm.</p>\n<p>The loss of vegetation due to the Thomas Fire, as well as last year’s Whittier, Sherpa and Rey fires, also increased the risk of flash flooding and debris. Without vegetation, rain that would generally cause very little runoff resulted in erosion and fatal flooding throughout the Montecito area.</p>\n<p>Caltrans reopened the 101 freeway on Jan. 21.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) first found a 23-year-old man unconscious with “ineffective breathing” at an apartment complex near the 800 block of Embarcadero Del Mar at approximately 12:50 a.m. on Dec. 25, SBSO said in a press release.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies arrived in minutes and found the victim turning purple and unable to breathe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police administered a single dose of Naloxone after assessing the signs as symptoms of an overdose, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naloxone is an intra-nasal spray that blocks or reverses the effects of opioids, including drowsiness, slowed breathing or loss of consciousness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then began to breathe more easily and regained consciousness in minutes. Paramedics took over care of the victim and transported him to the hospital for further treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Police Department, IVFP and Santa Barbara County Fire Department later responded to a report of an “unresponsive” 20-year-old male overdosing at an apartment complex on the 6600 block of Abrego Road at approximately 10:56 p.m. on Monday, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim was “barely breathing” and starting to turn purple, according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement found an individual trying to resuscitate the victim. Police took over and administered a single dose of Naloxone to the victim. The victim then regained consciousness, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police used an </span>automated external defibrillator<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to monitor the victim’s heartbeat until the victim began to breathe by himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paramedics then transported the victim to the hospital for further treatment, SBSO said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All SBSO deputies receive training on the use of Naloxone, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280. <em>Courtesy of Mike Eliason</em></p></div>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is now the largest recorded wildfire in California history after burning through 281,620 acres of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 20 days.</p>\n<p>A total of 1,586 fire personnel continue to fight the fire, with 116 fire engines, 61 fire crews, 26 helicopters, 19 bulldozers and 31 water tenders on the job, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The fire is currently 86 percent contained.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire that burned in San Diego County in October 2003. The Cedar Fire burned 273,246 acres, caused 15 deaths and destroyed 2,820 structures.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is approximately 16 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The fire line from Ventura to Santa Barbara is “contained and secure” and fire officials do not expect the fire to progress further since wind speeds have slowed, according to a Cal Fire press release on Sunday.</p>\n<p>All mandatory and voluntary evacuations have been lifted in Santa Barbara County, with the exception of a voluntary evacuation warning on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280.</p>\n<p>The blaze began on Dec. 4 and its cause is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire’s incident tracker.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents experienced <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/i-v-residents-out-of-power-for-three-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blackouts</a> the night the fire began and responded by flooding the streets of I.V., <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/watch-fireworks-and-couch-burnings-from-the-i-v-power-outage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting off fireworks and burning couches</a>.</p>\n<p>Air quality in Santa Barbara and Goleta improved to “good” after weeks of the “unhealthy” air quality that prompted Chancellor Henry T. Yang to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/petition-to-cancel-classes-due-to-thomas-fire-gains-3000-signatures-in-one-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cancel classes</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postpone finals.</a></p>\n<p>As many Santa Barbara evacuees begin to return home, county officials are encouraging residents to be aware of hazards caused by the fire, such as downed power lines.</p>\n<p>Residents may also see an increase in displaced wildlife and Cal Fire is urging residents to maintain a safe distance and avoid feeding animals.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has remained far from Isla Vista and the UCSB’s campus, but students felt its effects as they concluded Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuation center</a> at its Multi-Activity Center on Dec. 5, which held up to 200 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/thomas-fire-evacuees-hope-to-return-home-soon-ucsb-evacuation-center-remains-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuees affected</a> by the Thomas Fire. The university closed the shelter on Friday, Dec. 22.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans also stepped up during this tumultuous time. The I.V. Food Cooperative provided a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-20/isla-vista-food-co-op-aids-victims-of-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food donation bin</a> for those affected, raising over $1,000 in donations and offering a 15 percent discount for evacuees.</p>\n<p>Firefighters will continue to patrol the fire’s perimeter and use aircraft to drop water on steep areas with limited access. According to Cal Fire, firefighters intend to remain on standby in case new fires erupt as they work to suppress the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Dec. 25 at 10:34 p.m. </em></p><div

The change will be used to purchase basic needs for evacuees, such as food and personal care items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business has received over $1,000 in donations from the program and a few direct donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op’s food donation bin is available by the front door. Customers can donate non-perishable items that  are unopened and have non-breakable packaging.

The business brought approximately $600 worth of “special diet” food to the shelter, according to Cohen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Items donated to the evacuation center included yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, oat bars, protein bars, soup cups, plant and animal jerky sticks, bananas and other fresh food items.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire began on Dec. 4 and has since spread rapidly across the Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket.

Jimenez, a second-year undeclared major at UC Santa Barbara, settled on the idea for her interactive sculpture due to the recent impact of the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said in an email that the #MeToo Twitter hashtag recognizes how many people, mostly women, are sexually assaulted and “exposes the alarming numbers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said the project has a great deal of personal significance to her because she is a survivor of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she found it very difficult to acknowledge and speak of her experience, but that she regained a sense of hope and power after seeing the #MeToo movement trending on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the project, Jimenez was initially worried that simply posting a large sign with the hashtag would be too obvious, but quickly noticed that many students were still unaware of the meaning behind the viral campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t want people to think that I was trying to turn a subject that’s so important and disgusting into just a pretty photo opp or something ‘aesthetic,’” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she believed it would be powerful to see how many flowers stacked up on her art piece, representing how many people have been affected by sexual assault directly or indirectly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students choose to complete their projects off campus in Isla Vista, but Jimenez said for her that was not an option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I insisted on my piece being on campus because that’s the main audience I wanted to view my piece: my own peers,” Jimenez wrote in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

difficulty of getting permission from the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez decided not to submit a request to display her piece on the Storke Tower

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jimenez could be creative with the idea and creation of the project, she said she is grateful for the input and help she received along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the project would not have been possible without the support of three people: her professor, her aunt who owns a Carpinteria flower shop and UCSB woodshop technician Michael Matheson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she has mostly received positive responses to her piece, yet some people are still unaware of the topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that students have also responded positively on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All positive responses so

Currently, internet service providers like Verizon and AT&amp;T can’t charge websites to deliver content faster than other websites.</p>\n<p>The FCC now plans to vote on a repeal of network neutrality on Dec. 14, which would allow internet service providers to potentially serve users with extra charges and block, slow or speed up access to specific websites.</p>\n<p>Dylan Bolf, UC Santa Barbara Residential Computer Network (ResNet) technician, said that because UCSB purchases its bandwidth in bulk from a Tier 1 network, it was treated “neutrally” before the 2015 regulations were in place.</p>\n<p>A Tier 1 network is the overarching “backbone” of the internet, according to Bolf. By purchasing from a Tier 1 network, the university acts as a service provider for students.</p>\n<p>Regular consumers buy internet from Tier 3, which includes internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Cox, and would be subject to the new rules.</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, a software engineer and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District, explained that service providers like Comcast may want to repeal net neutrality to reduce risk and manage costs.</p>\n<p>Because customers demand unlimited internet plans to handle all their needs, Freeman said service companies must anticipate internet usage and predict how it might spike or fluctuate in the future.</p>\n<p>“They have essentially forced internet service providers in this horrible position of being insurance companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Their response to this is ‘we want the ability to charge somebody for the increase in bandwidth use by Netflix, whether it be Netflix or whether it be the user watching Netflix’… That is an argument that I can appreciate,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“It is still an argument that I find scary because I’ve seen absolute power corrupt absolutely,” he said.</p>\n<p>If the repeal goes through, the FCC would essentially restore “the internet to the state that it was two years ago,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Before Obama-era rules were implemented, residential users were the target of “extra charges and other net neutrality violating ideas,” Bolf said.</p>\n<p>For example, AT&amp;T blocked Apple’s FaceTime app from its data plan in 2012. If customers wanted to use the FaceTime app outside of Wi-Fi, they had to pay extra for an unlimited plan.</p>\n<p>Open internet advocacy groups claimed this was a violation of net neutrality, and AT&amp;T backed down before the groups filed an official complaint with the FCC.</p>\n<p>“We hope that we will be treated neutrally again if these rules are repealed, and would not violate the principles of net neutrality ourselves,” Bolf said in an email, explaining that UCSB would not manipulate the speed of any website.</p>\n<p>He added that ResNet “stands unanimously” behind the current net neutrality rules and hopes they remain in place.</p>\n<p>However, if the FCC does moves forward with the repeal, Bolf said ResNet would make sure the “students and residents are not impacted in any way that we can.”</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, UCSB’s associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said a cable company could artificially limit bandwidth to make certain services more appealing.</p>\n<p>“Imagine if AT&amp;T is the exclusive partner of Spotify and you can’t get Pandora on AT&amp;T without it hitting your bandwidth cap,” Hall said in an email.</p>\n<p>There will be an economic, innovational and choice impact to consumers in residential areas, Hall said, but “life on our UC campuses continues unchanged in the short term.”</p>\n<p>State senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents all of Santa Barbara County and western Ventura County, opposed the repeal saying it would set a “very dangerous precedent.”</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing is that [the repeal] will allow money interests to control content, to control access, to ultimately control thought,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said large, wealthy institutions like universities would be able to afford higher-quality internet, while a student startup wouldn’t be able to compete with large businesses.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure the internet is a fair and even playing field for all and continue to bridge our country’s existing digital divide,” he said. “That disparity will only grow if we do not act to protect net neutrality rules.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Dec. 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
