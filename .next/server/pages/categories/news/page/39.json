Since 2015, the UC system overall has accepted an additional 14,500 California undergraduates and aims to increase this in the coming years, as stated in the press release.</p>\n<p>“Part of UC’s mission is to do everything possible to help students reach their college dreams,” UC Regents Vice Chair John A. Perez added in the press release.</p>\n<p>“We continue to do so in a number of ways, including addressing the total cost of attendance, such as food and housing needs, and working to develop a multiyear strategic plan that not only supports students’ financial needs but also expands access to UC for more Californians.”</p>\n<p>Rising college costs, coupled with a growing movement calling for tuition-free colleges, have made tuition hikes increasingly controversial as the Regents discuss it each year. Students groups typically attend Regents meetings to argue against the hikes.</p>\n<p>Last year, the UC Regents voted to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-19/uc-regents-vote-to-decrease-tuition-by-60/\">lower</a> in-state tuition by $60 – a result from eliminating legal fees – and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised</a> out-of-state tuition tuition by 3.5 percent.</p>\n<p>As of Fall Quarter 2018, out-of-state students compose approximately 21 percent, or over 58,500 students, of the UC system. In 2017, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/regents-approve-nonresident-enrollment-cap/\">voted</a> to limit the number of out-of-state students allowed at each UC to 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The non resident numbers include both students from other states within the U.S. as well as international students.</p>\n<p>As of the 2018-2019 school year, <a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\">the cost of attending UCSB</a> as an in-state undergraduate who lives in an on-campus residence hall amounts to approximately $36,798; for an in-state undergraduate who lives off campus, this number drops to $33,768.</p>\n<p>Those numbers increase for nonresident students.</p>\n<p>However, according to the press release, about 57 percent of current California undergraduates pay no tuition, and an additional 20 percent have part of the costs covered by financial aid programs.</p>\n<p>The Regents will vote on whether or not to raise out-of-state tuition for the 2019-2020 during its upcoming meeting this week. Napolitano is recommending that the Regents increase nonresident tuition by 2.6 percent, from $28,992 to $29,754, the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-edu-uc-no-tuition-increase-20190307-story.html\">reported. </a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

I’ve known these people for quite awhile now and I’m very excited to work with them within this setting,” Moon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon said he has not received the training that A.S. senators undergo, but he has discussed when and how to undergo the training with Internal Vice President Steven Ho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding Salari, Moon said he believes Salari served admirably while she was on Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sorry to see that the situation had to end like this,” Moon said. “I wish Yasamin the best in all of her future endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Moon is currently one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the UC Advocacy Network.

Book Bank is unique because students can check out books for an entire quarter without returning them.</span> <em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) Book Bank is a student-run service that addresses this problem, offering thousands of textbooks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in all subjects </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to loan for the entire quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank, located in the Annex across from Storke Tower, is in its fourth year of operation. The problem it faces, however, is a lack of awareness. Of the 2,495 books in the collection this quarter, only 97 were checked out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year communication majors Catherine Barber and Jonathan Lee are working to solve this problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee took Professor Walid Afifi’s Social Marketing (COMM 168) course in Fall Quarter 2018, where students create proposals to resolve problems in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So my group in particular wanted to help reduce the cost of textbooks for students, just because a lot of students already have a lot of financial burden in their lives,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solution was to come up with some sort of textbook sharing program. But that led to us discovering the A.S. Book Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee sent surveys to around 80 students while creating their proposal, and only one student mentioned the Book Bank by name. Both Barber and Lee were unaware of the Book Bank before they began this project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I literally knew nothing about the Book Bank,” Lee said. “I didn’t even know where the Annex was. That was another thing, we recognized that not a lot of people knew where the Annex was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Barber and Lee heard about the Book Bank, they knew partnering with the organization would be the best way to solve the problem of high textbook prices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really different from other things that already exist on campus,” Barber said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Book Bank is unique because students can check out books for an entire quarter without returning them. Other free options such as course reserves at Davidson Library limit students to two hours in the library with checked out textbooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of Fall Quarter 2018, Barber and Lee created a proposal to make students more aware of the Book Bank, which included updating their website and utilizing social media platforms. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86659\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86659\" data-attachment-id=\"86659\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/a-s-book-bank-gains-new-exposure/as-book-bank_cameron-hsieh_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Book Bank_Cameron Hsieh_ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86659 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan.

The other four projects focused on the broader community, showing the wide range of what students proposed in the class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Book Bank project and the six others being implemented in this quarter provide a concrete example of what’s possible from this class,” Professor Afifi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the independent study course, Barber and Lee started implementing their ideas to improve the Book Bank at the beginning of the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the quarter [Barber and Lee] asked to meet with me to tell us what they worked on,” Katherin Jordan, fourth-year Director of the A.S. Book Bank, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan. The three meet biweekly and regularly email about their plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much everything Jonathan and I do, we run by [Jordan]. So we ask her what she needs, and she gives us ideas of what we can do. One of the main things she said she needed help with was marketing, and so that’s kind of the main thing Jonathan and I have done,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their strategy for the Book Bank was to increase awareness of the program and make it easier for students to check out books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do so, Lee said he and Barber had created a new social media plan for the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I post on Facebook and she posts on instagram, and we have 100+ followers on instagram and 300+ likes on our Facebook. Apparently people show up at the Book Bank asking about it all the time at the Annex now,” Lee said. “The front desk person was like talking about how there are so many people that come by, and seeing an increase in that was really cool for us to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee also updated the website so that the entire catalog is online. Students can search by title or ISBN number, and the website will show whether the textbook is available or checked out. Students can then go to the Book Bank to fill out an order form and pick up their textbook for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plans to expand the website in the future so students can check out books completely through the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we’re working on, which we haven’t quite figured out yet, is making it so you can check out the book completely online. Right now, we’re kind of working with the website and figuring out how to do that,”  Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another main project of Barber and Lee’s marketing campaign is to promote further growth of the Book Bank through book donation. The Book Bank will hold a book drive during finals week, where students can donate used textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book drive is vital to the Book Bank’s growth because of limits on where the Book Bank can purchase textbooks from. The Book Bank isn’t allowed to purchase books from the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook Page or from the book exchange, because every single purchase made requires a receipt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The books acquired have to be through donations or through purchasing books and actually receiving a receipt at legitimate websites or the publishers in general,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be donation boxes for the Book Drive at the Multicultural Center, the Student Resource Building, the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and at the Book Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of textbooks end up just sitting on people’s shelves or they get thrown away or they get sold for like 99 cents. That’s not doing anything to help anyone. So it’s just really helpful to donate your textbooks to a good cause and help future students like you save money,” Barber added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s expansion in the future includes plans to depart from the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and become an independent entity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC has been a great supporter and one of the main reasons the Book Bank has stayed alive for this long,” Jordan said. “As I started to work on improvements and future plans for the Book Bank, I realized that the Book Bank was outgrowing SIRRC and was ready to become a fully independent entity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the Book Bank being its own, there comes a lot quicker turn around on projects… as well as more money being focused purely on the Book Bank projects and improvements to provide the best resources for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Jordan, Barber and Lee are all seniors, they are looking for others to continue their work in the future. This led to the creation of the marketing intern position, where more than 80 students have already applied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want this project to just be a winter quarter thing. The marketing intern would just kind of take on what Catherine and I are doing right now, in terms of running the Facebook, managing the website and the Instagram,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing intern would help spread awareness of the Book Bank after Barber, Lee and Jordan graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is probably unreasonable, but I think our goal would be to have every student at least know about the Book Bank,” Lee said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish I had known about it sooner, and so even freshmen coming in to discuss it the way people talk about the course reserves, that it would just be common knowledge, and that people would recognize that this is a resource available to them.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-86673\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Police Department (UCPD) was the first and only organization to express interest in the space as of December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Bagel Cafe, Mojo Teahouse, the Isla Vista Trading Post and Off-Campus Senator Sydney Karmes-Wainer have reached out to Gary Lawrence], University Center (UCen) director, to ask about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would say that all of the inquiries have been informal and of the “information gathering” type,” Lawrence said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD previously said that if they submitted a proposal for the space, they would be primarily interested in using it as a Community Service Organization (CSO) station. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts,” UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-08/kaplan-ends-ucen-contract-ucpd-eyes-vacated-space/\">said</a> in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the difficulties in filling the space is that it does not have a kitchen, but instead a classroom, which may rule out food-based businesses. </span></p>\n<p><b>MOJO TEAHOUSE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mojo Teahouse owner Boxi Wang said that if Mojo Teahouse was selected for the space, they would only serve drinks. The location in Isla Vista serves drinks in addition to food items such as popcorn chicken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my understanding, it’s a pretty cool thing to sell boba at school. I’ve been to some campuses, but I don’t think [any] of them sell boba on campus,” Wang said. “They all have coffee and other alternatives, like let’s say Jamba Juice, over there, but they don’t have anything that’s like more towards Asians.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, having a location on campus would allow Mojo Teahouse to pick up some morning sales that they miss out on by being in I.V., Wang added. </span></p>\n<p><b>BAGEL CAFE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bagel Cafe Manager Jacob Root said that he had reached out to ask about a space in the UCen in late December or early January, but was told that there weren’t any available spaces at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re looking to put a satellite-type location out there,” Root said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would definitely need to make it semi-kitchen ready because we would want to bake bagels fresh over there,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Root hasn’t been able to check out the location yet, however, and said that he was waiting to hear back from Lawrence about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d have to look at the space, like I said, I just don’t know how many square feet it is, where the location is,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><b>ISLA VISTA TRADING POST</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Trading Post co-president Julia Rose Feldman said the organization has been looking for a permanent space for a while, especially since they are outgrowing their current storage space in another member’s garage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now we have just been working with our event-based model, which is great for what it is, but we’ve kind of outgrown the model,” Feldman, a fourth-year environmental studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At a few of our events we weren’t able to have the event for as long as we said we would because we just didn’t have anything to give out,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the permanent space would allow the I.V. Trading Post to keep more donations as well as create a space on campus where “where [students] know that the clothes [they donate] are going to be going to another loving home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are excited about the potential opportunity to have the space, but due to limited funding i’m not exactly sure if it’s going to be at all possible,” Feldman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We haven’t heard back about how much it’s going to cost, and as a relatively new organization, we have about $2,000 to our org’s name, so we’re not sure whether or not it’s even feasible.”</span></p>\n<p><b>SENATOR KARMES-WAINER</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer reached out to inquire about potentially putting a hot food bar in the space. She put out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">petition</a> calling for a hot food bar on campus in January and has since been working in Senate to try to make it a reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need a proper arrangement where students can build their own healthy meals, like a build-a-bowl hot bar with options for a clean protein, roasted vegetables, whole grains, &amp; healthy fats,” Karmes-Wainer wrote in the original <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/university-of-california-santa-barbara-ucsb-healthy-hot-bar\">petition</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer declined to comment about the potential leasing of the space until she had more information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vacant UCen space is currently occupied by the UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Services (HDAE) after its main office was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\">damaged</a> by an early February storm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said HDAE would be in the vacant UCen space for approximately two to four months, but that he didn’t anticipate their occupancy having any effect on future rentals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDAE is currently paying the standard rate while it uses the space. Kaplan paid $4,420 per month to rent the space. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

photo)</em></p></div>\n<p>“UC already has clear policies and procedures in place that protect anyone’s right to peacefully protest or speak on our campuses.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, March 2, President Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he discussed the executive order.</p>\n<p>“I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars,” President Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>\n<p>“Everyday we’re restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right and we believe in religious liberty,” he added.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President’s (UCOP) statement cited the UC as being the home of the free speech movement in the 1960s, along with the fact that UC campuses have hosted conservative speakers including Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager and Dinesh D’Souza.</p>\n<p>The UC has also established a National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement, which is “dedicated to exploring issues and challenges related to free expression through research, advocacy, debate and discussion,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referred to an incident when a representative of a conservative group was assaulted at UC Berkeley, adding that “the university acted swiftly.”</p>\n<p>“The campus released a statement strongly condemning the incident and expressing support for the police department’s efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice,” the statement said. “Chancellor Carol Christ also sent a campus-wide message reaffirming UC Berkeley’s commitment to freedom of expression.”</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano said the UC does not need the federal government to mandate free speech on college campuses, as it is already mandated.</p>\n<p>“Free speech is a fundamental value of the University of California and we already have strong policies in place that protect the free expression of ideas, regardless of political persuasion,” Napolitano said. “Protecting free expression has been part of the University of California’s DNA for decades.”</p>\n<p>College Republicans President Leslie Garcia, however, has differing views.</p>\n<p>Garcia said that Trump’s proposed executive order is an “incredible idea.”</p>\n<p>Garcia, a fourth-year political science and middle east studies double major, added that in the time she’s been at UCSB, “college conservatives have seen how far campus administrators and more left-leaning people are willing to go to shut down the discourse.”</p>\n<p>Garcia referenced when Ben Shapiro came to UCSB, and said that although there was a “leftist outcry” against Ben Shapiro, “the event was still funded and successful.”</p>\n<p>However, UC Berkeley had not been so lucky due to leftist groups enacting violence in a quest to shut down free speech, she added.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump spoke of his intent to issue the executive order, it is unclear when he will officially issue the executive order.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday marks the fulfillment of some of Black Student Union’s (BSU) primary goals in its demands throughout the years: the creation of an Office of Black Student Development at UCSB and a space on campus dedicated to Black students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang sent a message to the BSU Demands Team yesterday, promising funding for BSU’s eight proposed positions within the office, $55,000 annually for BSU programs and that the university would “work toward the vision of a Center for Black Student Development over the next several years,” according to the message.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These proposals were part of the most recent <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\">set of demands</a> BSU released to the university in February, but built upon over 50 years of efforts from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For BSU President Mariyah Lewis and BSU Demands Team leader Samantha Sanchez, seeing the fulfillment of these demands warranted a moment for the two to pause from their efforts and celebrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cried for about two and a half hours,” Sanchez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commitment the university made to the Black student community by fulfilling these demands speaks to a greater awareness of Black students and their unique needs as a student community on campus, Lewis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a good feeling to say the least, to know the administration is pushing for us and striving for better support of Black students on campus,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said BSU’s demands represent a vital aspect of university’s commitments, which include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“creating a culture that affirms the intrinsic dignity in each of us, celebrating differences, and making UC Santa Barbara an inclusive environment in which to live, work, and learn,” he wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to Black student groups and community members, Sanchez acknowledged the strides made by UCSB administrators in its support of Black students, noting that these commitments are a symbol of courage as well as progress toward equity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes strong leadership and courage on the behalf of administration to understand and implement a structure to repair those deficits and restore the Black community’s faith in the education system. Today, our university administration displayed both this leadership and courage,” Sanchez wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Sanchez said the fruition of these demands will pave the way for “monumental initiatives across the UC system to create greater access to higher institutions of learning and overall achievement for Black people and people of color.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez said that the hiring process for positions in the Office of Black Student Development can start immediately.

Biology is something that students see in high school, they already have an exposure to it,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>Stopple acknowledged the tendency for biology majors to declare the major with a pre-med track in mind, only to realize how overwhelming the major can be later on.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes [they switch out] because their grades were not good enough to get into medical school. They think ‘well if I’m not going to be a doctor then, I don’t want to do biology after all,’” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> reached out to students to gain insight on their perspectives regarding the department of biological sciences at UCSB, and found several recurring complaints.</p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that S.T.E.M. majors be rigorous and require strong academic engagement, many students expressed frustration with the difficulty of prerequisite classes, as well as an initial lack of emphasis on biology during the foundational coursework.</p>\n<p>“A lot of Bio students come in unsuspecting of how difficult the gen chem series is, especially resenting it because they’re not interested in studying chem in the first place, or necessarily good at it,” second-year pre-biology major Aja Whitehead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students found that the administrators and advisors were at best overburdened and at worst outright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>“The school would probably like to think that the major is hard and that’s why people are dropping it, but in all honesty I think the lack of support from the department itself plays a larger role,” Aidan, a fourth-year biology major who declined to give their last name, said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had great professors, but the advisors and administrators have never been helpful to me.”</p>\n<p>Olivia, a fourth-year aquatic biology major who asked that her last name not be used, expressed similar discontent with advisors who she felt encouraged her to take an excessive course load during her first quarter after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I really do feel that students look to the advisors for guidance and help with structuring their plans here and they do not provide that,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>Ivan, a fourth-year biology major who asked that his last name not be used, was among a group of about 20 undergraduate molecular, cellular and developmental biology (MCDB) students who were part of an external review committee. The committee invites other faculty from universities around the west coast to evaluate the department, gather input from students and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>“The complaints against the Bio department were pretty strong… comments ranged from poor class structures during the first two years all the way to a deficit advisory team,” Ivan said.</p>\n<p>However, members of the faculty have coordinated with students in attempts to raise retention rates. Mike Wilton and Eduardo Gonzalez, two lecturers in the MCDB department, have worked to make more resources available to incoming freshmen who declare as pre-biology majors.</p>\n<p>Associated Students On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal has also been collaborating with Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) — alongside Wilton and Gonzalez — in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>“[Wilton and Gonzalez] introduced the mentoring series MCDB 11, 12 and 13, which are to be taken in conjunction with the gen chem series,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>MCDB 11, 12 and 13 serve as chemistry support classes, so one can establish a community of like-minded peers with who to study and hold each other accountable. For classes like the general chemistry series which lack a section, Nagpal believes that these provide a more collaborative and intimate setting.</p>\n<p>“Having these support programs that [Wilton and Gonzalez] create is essential to student success,” Nagpal said. “They see that students who take MCDB 11, 12 and 13… these students specifically have higher retention rates in the pre-biology major.”</p>\n<p>EOP students are a demographic which leave the biology major at a much higher rate than the general student body, Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>“Low-income students have to work for college compared to their more-privileged peers… because of this they can’t devote as much attention to their academics,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Nagpal is advocating for the expansion of financial support to more EOP-eligible students, which he hopes will alleviate some of this financial stress.</p>\n<p>“EOP has an emergency grant alongside A.S., and as a senator I have taken it upon myself to work with the director of EOP, Aaron Jones, to revise the A.S. EOP grant and essentially expand this,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Although a consensus from students is relatively easy to find just by surveying the academic body, extensive qualitative information regarding the “why” of switching majors has not been compiled.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to have more data in many ways, and know more about the process by which students change majors. We could do better generally, as a campus, in collecting data,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:46 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Students and faculty can search for open access online, use a inter-library loan or asking a librarian for more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Day in and day out, our librarians are finding content that’s behind paywalls, content that is out there that students, faculty [and] the UCSB community need to find,” Rick Stockwood, communications and marketing manager at the UCSB library, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone stumbles across a paywall like we all do almost everyday, trying to reach something, the librarians are here to help find that content.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Librarians at UC libraries are also able to purchase specific articles for access using the budget that would normally go to funding the contract with Elsevier, according to Antelman.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the library acquisition budget will also go to investing in open access initiatives elsewhere and working with a subcommittee of the Academic Senate to create a fund to facilitate open access of UC research articles, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC researchers have to pay an article processing charge to Elsevier in order to enable open access to their articles, which Antelman said usually costs around $3,000. This fund would help researchers cover this cost.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through the subscription dollars the library is currently paying, we would help subsidize those fees and they would be lower so that if the researcher wanted to publish open access, they would pay much less,” Antelman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The push for open access of UC research articles started in 2013 when the UC Academic Senate adopted a policy which iterated UC’s commitment to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible,” according to the official policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will soon sign onto an “</span><a href=\"https://oa2020.org/mission/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expression of Interest,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” according to Antelman, which asserts the importance of creating open access for research article and leaving the subscription model of the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UC signatories of the document include UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles and most recently UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC isn’t completely closing to door to Elsevier, however. UC still retains access to most articles from Elsevier before 2019 and room remains for more negotiations in the future, Antelman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hopeful that over time, Elsevier will possibly come back with another proposal and that we could possibly have a successful deal concluded, but at this point, it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The shop, located at 6549 Pardall Rd., debuted on Tuesday and is both the newest and only barbershop in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making the decision to open a second shop in I.V., Ramirez took a grassroots style approach to best figure out the location of his second shop, asking students in the community about their thoughts on having a barbershop in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I came out here, there was no barbershop, so I was like, ‘Geesh, where are these kids going [for a haircut]?’ So I started talking to kids, asking them where they get their haircut … [I found out that] a lot of them wait to go back home to get their haircut because there’s nowhere to go, and they don’t trust anybody,” Ramirez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the lack of barber shops may have posed an inconvenience to residents in the past, Ramirez believes his new shop in I.V. will remedy these problems by offering a prime location in I.V. as well as a unique customer experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For $25, many shops offer quality haircuts, but not many offer a quality experience, which Ramirez finds to be a defining characteristic in successful barbershops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accompany the debut of his new shop, Ramirez opted to include a pool table, multiple flat-screen TVs, back massagers and refreshments for patrons — all of which he is confident will contribute to the “experience” of coming to his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Getting a haircut, you shouldn’t have to be like, ‘Oh, I have to get a haircut,’ you should be stoked to get a haircut. You get to come, hangout, get here an hour early, watch the game,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more than a barbershop. It’s an experience, and that’s what we’re providing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other ideas, Ramirez plans to make use of the large white walls surrounding the inside of the shop, flirting with the idea of featuring student-generated art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the amenities, Ramirez’s idea of the barbershop “experience” did not occur to him overnight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he began working as a barber, Ramirez used to frequent barbershops as often as once a week, where he was attracted to its overall atmosphere and ambiance.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86655\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86655\" data-attachment-id=\"86655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/barbershop-debut-sparks-new-buzz-in-i-v/barber-shop-iv_ida-kazerani_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1428&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1428\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Barber Shop IV_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ramirez wants his barbershop to be a place where people come to have a good time. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was the type of guy, back then, who’d get a haircut once a week because I liked going to the barbershop. I liked hanging out, I liked talking with the boys and watching the games,”  he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With multiple shops of his own, Ramirez aims to replicate the same qualities that initially attracted him to become a regular at barbershops he frequented before he began cutting hair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cutting hair in high school, Ramirez was formally introduced to the barbershop world when he was 20, after his best friend convinced him to get his barber license and work at his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started at a shop in Pismo Beach, came out to Santa Barbara, cut hair at a shop called Montecito Barbers, was there for five years, broke off and built my own shop. And now we’re here, number two,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently dividing his time between both locations, Ramirez used to spend all of his time at the Montecito location after opening it in 2010. Things were going smoothly for Ramirez until the massive flood ravaged through Montecito last January, making it impossible for him and his barbers to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than waiting it out, Ramirez devised a plan to work around the flooding by setting up a pop-up shop in the back room of a wine store.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were out of work and the village was shut down, so we did a pop-up shop over at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie Slone Wines. We had this little space in the back where we put up four chairs, people came in and got their haircut … it was just a cool thing for the community to come together and help everybody out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses such as Ramirez’s, mudslides can have a devastating impact on revenue, keeping customers away and making barbers unable to reach the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the pop-up shop helped Ramirez appreciate the power of community, something he hopes to carry with him to his new location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you put a barber shop in, you become a hub of the town … We like to integrate ourselves into the community, we like to do things, have events, after-hour events,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna do as much for the students as possible — this shop is for the students.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Santa Barbara’s chapter of the union for teaching assistants, tutors, readers and more, put on the rally with the goal of pressuring the university into agreeing to a list of demands the workers compiled in light of UCPath’s failures, according to graduate student Cristina Awadalla, a member of UAW 2865.</p>\n<p>The demands include “issue back pay, resolve all outstanding pay issues, including overpayments and correcting W2s, and reparations for affected student-workers.”</p>\n<p>UC and UAW <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\">came to an agreement</a> on Feb. 25, offering additional payment for affected workers. Each student employee affected by UCPath will receive $150 after taxes, and employees with paycheck issues that spanned more than one month will receive additional compensation up to a maximum of $450.</p>\n<p>This agreement did not address backpay, overpayments or other issues.</p>\n<p>Throughout the protest, several speakers took the floor to discuss their frustrations with UCPath as well as with the path to achieving restitution.</p>\n<p>Some speakers mentioned personal anecdotes about how they had been affected with UCPath; one student worker, Department of Chicano Studies PhD student Mariano Nava Botello, had his car repossessed because he was not getting paid on time, according to a petition posted to the UAW Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Sheila Kulkarni, one of the speakers and a first-year chemistry graduate student at UCSB, expressed frustrations about how the university is dealing with UCPath issues.</p>\n<p>“I shouldn’t have to be in the Chancellor’s office to solve payroll issues or yell about my problems at Storke Tower,” Kulkarni said. “I never should have had to experience this nonsense in the first place.”</p>\n<p>After the speakers, the group of students and workers began their march, walking from Storke tower, through the Arbor walkway to finish at Cheadle Hall. Over the course of the march, the group maintained constant chants that advocated for workers’ rights on campus, such as, “One day longer, one day stronger.”</p>\n<p>As the protestors collected around Cheadle Hall, they again formed a group and reiterated the reasons behind the march through a microphone before walking into the administration building, where they searched for someone within the budget department to help the student workers with more serious financial problems caused by UCPath.</p>\n<p>After the issues with UCPath began in August 2018, UAW 2865 and the Graduate Student Association joined teams to address the university with their grievances.</p>\n<p>That partnership began pushing out surveys in October for students affected by UCPath in order to gather information on the extent of the payment problems.</p>\n<p>Providing proof of the issues of UCPath has been no small task, according to UAW sergeant-in-arms and graduate student, Lisa August-Schmidt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been asked as a union to prove that people haven’t been paid, so we have to file every single case individually and provide every single name,” August-Schmidt said.</p>\n<p>UCPath will be <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-01/ucpath-system-outage-to-occur-due-to-integration-of-new-uc-campuses/\">implemented</a> at two other UC campuses — UC Berkeley and UC Davis — during the month of March.

By withdrawing from Fall Quarter 2018, Martinez violated this section of Legal Code, Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is unclear if Martinez will face any repercussions for the violation. In the statement, Safadi emphasized that there are no discernible consequences in Legal Code for executives who do not complete the required six units. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi wrote in her statement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nowhere in the legal code does it state what the implications for the incompletion of (6) units are and nowhere in the legal code does it discuss actions on an elected official’s honoraria in the case of such incompletion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi also referenced the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\"> article</a> which found that four executives over the last five years were either not enrolled or took fewer than six units during their terms of service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, it was unclear what it meant for elected officers to “complete” six units, Safadi noted in a previous interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Upon communication with the Office of the Registrar at (805) 893-3592, University Policies were made evident and withdrawing from a quarter equates incomplete units and therefore it would not have been possible for Ms. Martinez to meet that (6) unit requirement expected from “Appointed and Elected officers,”” she wrote in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she did not believe she violated Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Zeina’s interpretation, in her experience serving for the last two quarters, she interpreted it as ‘that’s the requirement you need to hold the position,’” Martinez said. “As my experience as senator, that’s not how I interpreted it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t really say that there should be a consequence because I don’t really see it as black and white in terms of just me violating it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said she believed the main point of Safadi’s statement was to draw attention to the lack of clarity in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of eligibility has come up several times during the 2018-2019 school year within A.S., most prominently with Martinez and former On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari. Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed</a> from her position early last week after Judicial Council ruled that she violated the eligibility portion of the code by living off-campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Salari’s situation, and to the ambiguity of Legal Code, Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\">bill</a> that would update the eligibility section of Legal Code at the Feb. 20 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would give the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, currently Marisela Marquez, the power to grant elected officials a one-time exception for failing to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original version of the bill was written to only apply to senators, but an updated version sent out two hours before the Feb. 20 Senate meeting was expanded to include all elected officers, including executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill has since been tabled twice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez serves as a student sponsor on the bill, and said that as the only non-partisan office in A.S., she felt the S.A.G. was the best equipped to decide whether or not to grant an elected officer a one-time exception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi offered her office’s guidance to any senators who were interested in updating Legal Code, and urged the Judicial Council to write an advisory statement to the Senate to support its necessity. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
