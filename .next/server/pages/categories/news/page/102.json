According to the statement, if Wells Fargo fails to do so by the deadline, ABC will continue to pressure the UC to divest its $425 million invested with Wells Fargo. ABC pressured UC to divest from private prisons in December, prompting UC to sell approximately $25 million in private prison shares.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, said black students remain upset that the UC invests in Wells Fargo despite selling its shares in private prison corporations. Mitchell said she believes Wells Fargo contributes to private prison funding.</p>\n<p>“We cannot be complacent with the fact that our tuition is being invested, either indirectly or directly, to the incarceration of our people,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>ABC spokesperson Anthony Williams, citing research conducted by Enlace’s Private Prison Divestment Campaign, said Wells Fargo is financially invested in private prison corporations such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO) in several ways.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, Wells Fargo owns 1.5 million shares in GEO and CCA, acts as an issuing lender on CCA’s $900 million line of credit and serves as bond trustee to GEO’s $300 million corporate debt.</p>\n<p>“They are funding private prisons,” Williams said. “Wells Fargo is completely complicit in private prisons and what they do and how they treat people, which is horrid.”</p>\n<p>According to Wells Fargo spokesperson Ruben Pulido, the bank bears no financial investment in either GEO or CCA. Pulido said Wells Fargo Funds, owned by the funds’ investors and not Wells Fargo, currently holds a small position in the companies through a passive index fund.</p>\n<p>“Wells Fargo holds no investment in either The GEO Group or the Corrections Corporation of America,” Pulido said in an email. “We have no seat on either company’s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Henning Bohn said Wells Fargo provides passive index funds for customers to invest in other companies, which is a product that “any random financial firm” would offer to its customers. Bohn said Wells Fargo customers own the shares in private prison corporations, not Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>“From an economic perspective, I would say [Wells Fargo] doesn’t really hold an economic interest because the interest is held by their customers — those are the beneficiaries,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Bohn said if Wells Fargo were to end all investments in private prison corporations through index funds, the bank would first have to withdraw all index fund products, and would only offer funds investing in companies in which the bank wants clients to invest.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that Wells Fargo is probably not going to do,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said she does not believe the distinction between Well Fargo and Wells Fargo Funds makes a difference.</p>\n<p>“It’s still Wells Fargo,” Mitchell said. “You can separate it however you want bureaucratically, but it is the arm of the same system.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, black student leaders want UC and other “financiers” to divest from for-profit prisons because of how incarceration oppresses black people.</p>\n<p>“Private prisons literally make a profit off of the incarceration of people, who, within a system that’s rooted in white supremacy and capitalism, are for the most part black and brown bodies,” Mitchell said. “Their system of mass incarceration has not helped the black community.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the business model of private prisons requires they lobby for criminal justice and immigration policies to incarcerate as many people as possible. Williams also said these policies generally lead to the disproportionate number of racial minorities in the prison facilities of corporations like GEO and CCA.</p>\n<p>“Their business model is getting as many people incarcerated as possible and having contracts, and if they can’t do that, then how are they going to make money?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to CCA Director of Public Affairs Jonathan Burns, CCA does not take an active stance on public policies affecting incarceration.</p>\n<p>“To be clear, CCA does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Burns said in an email.</p>\n<p>GEO Vice President of Corporate Relations Pablo Paez also said he “vehemently refutes” these charges.</p>\n<p>“The allegation that our company has engaged in lobbying and advocacy for public policies that are detrimental to communities is simply not accurate,” Paez said. “Our company has never taken a position on criminal justice or immigration policies.”</p>\n<p>Paez said GEO helps those who are incarcerated by investing millions of dollars into rehabilitation and re-entry programs for prisoners to transition more smoothly back into society.</p>\n<p>“Groups like this one advance the notion that groups in our industry are somehow unaccountable to the government and to the public,” Paez said. “What we’ve done over the years is counter the rhetoric that is being advanced by groups like that of the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is nothing a private prison corporation like GEO can do to be accountable to the public except to close its doors.</p>\n<p>“For private prison organizations to be accountable to the public, they would have to shut down,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-67369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant, locally known as Gio’s, will be permanently closed on Thursday, Jan. 14 after seven years under current owner Matt Metzka’s management.</p>\n<p>Established in 1982, Gio’s was purchased by Metzka in 2009. Metzka will be permanently closing Gio’s this week after losing a legal battle to renew his lease for the restaurant. The current lease owners have not disclosed their future plans concerning the property, and Metzka is debating opening another business in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Metzka said the legal battle was quietly “going on for years,” and he wished the situation had worked out differently.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was other opportunities to work with the landlords, but they don’t want me in the building,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he is unsure of what will happen to the building, the property or his staff after the restaurant closes.</p>\n<p>“They may tear the building down. They might try to run another restaurant. I don’t know what they’re going to do. I have no say,” Metzka said. “If they lease it to somebody else and approach my guys and say ‘hey, do you want to work for me,’ obviously they could.”</p>\n<p>Metzka is debating on whether to buy or lease another property in I.V., but said he has no potential time frame for when that may happen.</p>\n<p>“I mean this is what I do. I have talked to a couple other business owners around who are selling,” Metzka said. “I’m just trying to de-stress from all of this and evaluate. At the end of the day, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”</p>\n<p>If he decides to run another business in I.V., Metzka said he is unsure about opening another pizza place.</p>\n<p>“After having Sorrisos, Blaze and Pizza my Heart open up in 2012 and 2013, it’s like ‘Really? You already had Woodstocks, Domino’s, Pasta House and Rusty’s delivering in I.V. in 2009,’” Metzka said. “There’s seven pizza places now, the burrito places are almost as bad.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the new property owners have the option to rebuild and remodel the building.</p>\n<p>“Someone might try to come in and run Gio’s, another type of Gio’s,” Metzka said. “Someone might come in and totally change the concept or demolish the building and make a three-story building. In fact, if I was building, that’s what I would want.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he has met amazing people during his seven years of working at Gio’s, and will miss his interactions with staff the most.</p>\n<p>“The guys in the kitchen. Some of these guys have worked here forever. Marco, Pedro, these guys have been here five, six years,” Metzka said. “My morning chef has been here for 18 years. That’s why the food here is always so good, because the guys in the kitchen have worked here forever. I don’t change my kitchen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67370\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67370\" data-attachment-id=\"67370\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/gios-closing_by-eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452714931\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gio’s Closing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67370\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gio’s employee and SBCC student Erin Lambie said even though she has only been working since October, she is incredibly saddened by the Gio’s closing.</p>\n<p>“It’s so sad. Just seeing how big it gets during big games and trying to talk to people like ‘Wait, what did you say? I can’t hear you,’” Lambie said. “It’s weird, but it gets so exciting. Or they call you and ask what the deal on the pitchers are and you’re like ‘they’re $6, ‘and they’re like ‘Oh my god it’s Disneyland.’”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the day before he announced the restaurant’s closure, his previous Instagram post had 14 likes and no comments. The day after he posted the closure, he received over 250 likes and 300 comments.</p>\n<p>“I mean, talk about beyond moved. I mean we’re talking about countless comments,” Metzka said. “We’re talking frowny faces and ‘I met my best friend here.’ It’s never going to be the same. These comments are fucking amazing.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Conner Jainese said the closing of Gio’s is a “tragedy” in I.V.<br>\n“Honestly, it’s the stronghold of Isla Vista and the only place where you can get a slice and a pitcher without breaking your wallet,” Jainese said.</p>\n<p>Kaylie Roujmer, fourth-year biochemistry major, said she originally thought Gio’s closing post on Instagram was a joke to get more business.<br>\n“I thought it was just a prank, like ‘No, Gio’s can’t be closing.’ Gio’s is one of the best places to get food and people just don’t believe it’s happening. I’ve even heard of people thinking of creating a petition to try and stop it from happening.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said people have been approaching him since he made a Facebook page announcing the restaurant’s closure.</p>\n<p>“I had like 30 or 40 people walk up to me and they were like ‘what the fuck?’ And I was like ‘I know,’” Metzka said. “They were like ‘this isn’t okay’ and honestly, I don’t know what to tell you.”</p>\n<p>Jainese said it was also difficult for him to believe that Gio’s will be permanently closed after Thursday night.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s one of those comedy movies where everyone gathers in the library to meet to figure out a way to save their favorite hang-out place. Everyone would use their majors and show how Gio’s has affected them to save the restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said some of his favorite weekends to work were graduation weekend, alumni weekend and Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was super fun. We had the last Floatopia in 2009,” Metzka said. “Then after that, when it became Deltopia, I used to go to Kmart and buy a big kiddie pool for the patio and fill it with water then say ‘oh, it’s the beach.’”</p>\n<p>Hope Curran, fourth-year global studies and art double major, said she spent a lot of time celebrating different parties and events at Gio’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge part of the I.V. community. Especially people over 21 come here to have fun and chill and it’s actually a great alternative to partying on D.P. with minors,” Curran said. “It’s a much more relaxed environment, and socially, I feel it’s much healthier than what you can find in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said one his favorite memories during his time at Gio’s was when a couple of girls walked in “stoned” and stood at the counter for six minutes in “dead silence.”</p>\n<p>“Me and my staff stared at them the whole time, waiting patiently. After silent menu-looking, they look at me they go ‘so how much is that so far?’ Like sweetie, no you haven’t ordered. And they’re like ‘oh fuck’ and go straight back into staring,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he moved to Santa Barbara in 2000 and lived in I.V. from 2000 to 2003 before buying Gio’s in 2009.</p>\n<p>“I’m your poster child for ‘don’t go to college, don’t incur a whole lot of debt, work your ass off and buy something,’” Metzka said. “I did finish UCSB extension for a licensing certificate. I did some stuff there but college and I aren’t friends.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he chose to buy Gio’s after spending time there with his friends when he first moved to the area.</p>\n<p>“I used to come to Gio’s and I used to eat burgers and have a beer and watch the game,” Metzka said. “This was always the spot. It was always the hang our spot. It was the biggest place in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Natalie Tran, fourth-year psychology major, said Gio’s is a landmark of I.V. and she is going to miss the restaurant’s atmosphere the most.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely the vibes, you know? You’re just not going to find that anywhere else,” Tran said. “Not at Hana Kitchen, not at Domino’s, just at Gio’s. It’s irreplaceable. I don’t even want to bike by it anymore. We’re going to miss it so much. Thank you, Gio’s.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

the original building constructed on Santa Barbara’s campus in 1954.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB library, from its beginning, was meant to be the physical and geographical center of UCSB,” Stephens said.</p>\n<p>Stephens said the library renovation focused on technological and educational innovations as well as creating more student and faculty study space.</p>\n<p>“More than just a renovation of outdated buildings, we began a reimagining of what resource services could be,” Stephens said. “[It has] bright inspiring resource galleries which provide spaces to study and think … and a [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] certified building which addresses the environmental focus of our campus and of our time.”<br>\nAssociated Students President Jimmy Villarreal said the library is an “essential” part of UCSB student life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67374\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67374\"

means to be a Gaucho, but there is nothing more familiar to every student here than heading to the library to work on a paper or study for an exam,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal praised the addition of 1,800 new electrical outlets during the renovation and announced that the UCSB Library’s Learning Commons would be the recipient of the 2016 Senior Class Gift. The gift will come in the form of a combination of high tech study resources including a dedicated 3-D printer.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang highlighted the importance of libraries on campuses, saying the UCSB Library receives over 1.5 million visits a year.</p>\n<p>“As a hub of information, a library is a key component of inspiring original thought, creativity and communication,” Yang said. “As we celebrate the opening of this phenomenal building, let us also celebrate the bright future it represents for our campus.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said that it was “important this ceremony is being held at the ‘Paseo.’”</p>\n<p>“This passage is not a corridor, it’s a vital artery in the heart of the campus,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Marshall finished on a more personal note, focusing on the library’s role in students’ lives and what it symbolizes to an academic community.</p>\n<p>“The library remains a place of learning and teaching, the crossroads of tradition and innovation, a laboratory of discovery and reinvention,” Marshall said. “Our new library offers a safe refuge space for quiet study and contemplation. It’s a place to lose oneself and to find oneself alongside others.”</p>\n<p>Following Marshall’s speech, representatives from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Das Williams’ offices presented Yang and Stephens with a plaque commemorating the opening of the renovated library.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, Associated Students advisor and Graduate Student Association president, said current U.S. culture celebrates the addictions of money, power and prestige and instead invited all in attendance to celebrate the addiction to truth.</p>\n<p>“I have chosen this opportunity to invite you all to share a different type of addiction, something we can all be addicted to and not be ashamed of,” Jones said. “The addiction to truth, the addiction to the acquisition of knowledge, the addiction to finding our own individual answers to questions posed in the classroom and throughout our daily lives. That addiction, that quest, is what our newly renovated library inspires me to share with you.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67373\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67373\" data-attachment-id=\"67373\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/ceremony-held-for-opening-of-new-library/student-speaker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"student speaker\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452701975\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"student speaker\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student speaker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67373\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"student speaker\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67373\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following Jones’ speech, Yang cut a ceremonial ribbon and welcomed all in attendance to come explore the space while musical and dance groups performed throughout the library.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said she wants to try out every chair in the building.</p>\n<p>“The chairs are amazing; I’ve sat on four different types so far, so it’s really fun to check out all of them,” Armistead said. “There’s some tall stools, there’s some that are kinda like arm chairs, and then, [check] out these chairs in the training room, they contour to your body very nicely.”<br>\nArmistead said she is already in love with the new library addition, although she is worried it may still be too small for the hordes of students who come to study.</p>\n<p>“I love how the entrance is so grand and inviting.

deputies have been testing body-worn video cameras for about a year, and all 16 may be wearing the cameras in the spring, according to Sol Linver, commander of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping by the end of next quarter we’ll have an idea which [camera to purchase],” Linver said. This would begin the next phase of the body camera pilot program, outfitting all Santa Barbara County deputies who are “not routinely in cars” with one of five potential body camera brands, something Linver hopes to do by April. The department has been evaluating the use of body cameras over the last year, attempting to determine the most effective camera, select an affordable managing program and server for viewing and storing video and obtain the money to purchase these items.</p>\n<p>Police departments across the country have increasingly turned to body cameras amid calls for transparency from activists and politicians after a series of highly publicized and controversial deaths at the hands of police in Ferguson, Mo., Staten Island, N.Y. and Baltimore. Linver said this sudden spike in demand forced camera companies to hastily develop and sell cameras, flooding the market with subpar products.</p>\n<p>Now that the initial eagerness of police departments is ebbing, Linver said, officials are “starting to slow everybody down” and ask for a camera “that’s going to last — not something that’s just going to go out there so we can say we have body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Los Angeles officials recently balked at approving a $57 million <a href=\"http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2015/15-0479-S2_misc_1_11-25-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> to purchase more than 6,000 body cameras for the LAPD. City council members delayed the vote amid critics’ concerns that the city relied too heavily on another county’s pilot program and only tested two camera brands itself.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department has taken a different approach, independently evaluating five brands of body cameras — VidMic, VidCam, BodyCam, TASER and COBAN — based on durability, nighttime video quality, charging time, battery life, time and date stamping, internal memory, still image quality and more.</p>\n<p>“We chose to do the pilot project and do this right before we go out there and spend a great deal of money on cameras,” said Linver, who was also the project manager of the pilot program. “I don’t want to spend 20 or 30 thousand dollars on cameras that are only going to last one year. That’s not being frugal — that’s not what the taxpayers expect from us.”</p>\n<p>Linver emphasized the importance of thoroughly evaluating each product during the trial before committing to one brand. He pointedly recalled one camera model having “major software issues” until the company’s CEO traveled to Santa Barbara and replaced all of the faulty cameras with newer versions.</p>\n<p>A flawed camera was a hassle then, but during interactions between police officers and civilians, a flaw could mean losing crucial evidence.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for something that can handle rain, can handle dust, can handle jarring,” Linver said. “If I’ve got a deputy who’s rolling around — unfortunately — with someone on the ground or involved in a fight, I don’t want the camera to just stop. That’s really when I need it.”</p>\n<p>Linver said the cameras range from about $200 for the TASER brand to nearly $500 for the VidMic, but that the greatest expense is in storing recorded video.</p>\n<p>The department estimates that each camera will produce, on average, slightly less than two terabytes of data per year, roughly equivalent to half a million songs in an iTunes library. Linver said in December that he had just purchased a 72 TB server for $24,000 to store video from car and body-worn cameras.</p>\n<p>Linver said he had looked into federal grants — which almost exclusively apply to the hardware, rather than storage expenses — and also plans to explore other means of funding, such as drawing from the department’s general fund or requesting funds from the county Board of Supervisors or Police Foundation.</p>\n<p>Matthew West, a deputy at the IVFP station, voluntarily purchased his own body camera in November of 2014 and said he uses it as an aid to write detailed reports and protect himself from potentially unfounded claims of excessive force.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been going on in the media, obviously I know what I’m doing is right, but I want to protect myself,” West said. “I don’t want it to be my word against their word. Times have changed, and if I have video and it clearly shows something, that’s what happened, it’s on the video.”</p>\n<p>West said he thought officers in the foot patrol office were generally supportive of implementing body cameras, and said he “highly recommends” using them in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Especially out here is where they’re needed, because [IVFP has] one car with a video camera, but 90 percent of the time, we’re walking around,” West said.</p>\n<p>The IVFP office comprises the largest group of deputies in the county who spend the majority of their time on bicycle or on foot, according to Linver.</p>\n<p>Linver said deputies are increasingly seeing cameras as an “important, helpful tool,” and deputies in places like Goleta and Carpinteria have purchased their own cameras as well.</p>\n<p>“Ten or 12 years ago … you had some deputies who wanted to drive the car where the camera didn’t work,” Linver said. “Now they’re all like, ‘Hey, my camera doesn’t work, I don’t want to go out there in the field,’ because our deputies nowadays realize the benefit of having video.”</p>\n<p>West said his body camera, made by Wolfcom, allows him to pay more attention to people rather than being buried in his notepad.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to take such accurate notes because ultimately you’re going to have everything on video,” West said. “If it’s a pretty complex case or investigation, you can get specific quotes from people when you’re writing your report.”</p>\n<p>Section 450.9 of the department’s policy manual, parts of which were obtained through a public records request by the<em> Daily Nexus</em>, states members of the sheriff’s office “should review their recordings as a resource” when preparing written reports.</p>\n<p>“With perception, sometimes you look at a video and you say, ‘oh, that’s what happened,’” Linver said. “When there is a complaint filed against an officer or deputy, [recordings are] a tool that we can look at.”</p>\n<p>“There are also times where officers will do things wrong,” Linver said. “Sometimes they don’t know the things they’re doing are wrong, and we work with training and things to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>\n<p>The department’s policy manual also says, “Uniformed members should wear the recorder in a conspicuous manner or otherwise notify persons that they are being recorded, whenever possible.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Jeffrey Greene said that citizens’ behavior can change when they know they are being recorded.</p>\n<p>“You tell them, ‘I’m recording you, so keep up what you’re doing and let the judge or your parents see that,’ and immediately, their behavior changes,” Greene said, adding that this tactic is not as effective in I.V., where unruly students are often “already drunk and typically beyond caring mode.”</p>\n<p>Whether a body camera is a deputy’s personal device or part of the pilot program, the recordings are uploaded to the department’s server and could potentially be used in investigations.</p>\n<p>Greene said video recordings are retained by the department for three years, unless they are “deemed necessary for some type of criminal [investigation] or tagged for evidence in a crime.”</p>\n<p>Linver said he had already used body camera footage from the pilot program in a “use of force” investigation in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara County’s district attorney, said she always welcomes more evidence, but that body cameras may not be as conclusive as some expect.</p>\n<p>“Whether [body cameras] would further justice or not is yet to be seen,” Dudley said. “Think about filmmakers — filmmakers choose their angle, filmmakers choose what they want to portray, and I think it’s the same thing for cell phone video and body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she has seen juries perceive video to be an infallible piece of evidence, when it may not tell the whole story.</p>\n<p>“Because I’ve seen the other part — that is, [footage] only from a certain angle and for a certain amount of time — I’ve seen injustice,” Dudley said. “I’m very frustrated with body cams because with witnesses,  juries could sit there and watch people as they describe what happened and judge their credibility, and now juries are more likely to just believe the videotape and not judge what they saw.”</p>\n<p>For this reason, Dudley said, it’s important that any witnesses with footage of a controversial event make their video accessible.</p>\n<p>“The more tapes we have, the better,” Dudley said. “Get those tapes in.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building to discuss solutions to Isla Vista’s problematic parking situation.</p>\n<p>I.V. has long suffered from overcrowding and a lack of parking, with students and families struggling to find cheap and accessible parking spots. The meeting discussed long-term parking regulations, potential parking permits and affordability for low-income families.</p>\n<p>Matt Schneider, Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division, said a parking monitoring program could provide useful information about the parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We held a meeting here in Isla Vista in October and we talked about what the current parking plan is in Isla Vista — a master plan update,” Schneider said. “Right now it revolves around a parking monitoring program, and they would require surveying parking conditions on an annual basis.”</p>\n<p>Jen Brookshire, Parking Enforcing Officer, said she often encounters issues with sidewalk parking and long-term vehicle parking. Santa Barbara County municipal code states, “No person who owns or has possession, custody or control of any vehicle shall park such vehicle upon any street or alley for more than a consecutive period of seventy-two (72) hours.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67346\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67346\" data-attachment-id=\"67346\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/stakeholders-discuss-parking-problems-for-iv-residents/stakeholders_by-paris-cullen-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452671348\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Paris Cullen-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67346\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67346\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“We are trying to work on not having long-term parking [restrictions] so parking is more available for the students,” Brookshire said. “Sidewalk parking is a big one that I.V. foot patrol is looking at. You cannot be blocking the sidewalk. It’s a safety hazard for pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>The Surfrider Foundation, a coastline preservation agency, presented a two-year parking proposal outlining parking permits, guest passes, cost and time restrictions:</p>\n<p>1. Permits would be issued only to I.V. residents.<br>\n2. Guest passes would be available.<br>\n3. Permits would be required for all cars parked on Isla Vista streets between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.<br>\n4. The cost of the permits would be as affordable as possible.<br>\n5. Potential sources of funding are Santa Barbara County, UCSB and available grants.<br>\n6. Monitoring would be conducted by student residents of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major, said the permits could still be too costly for low-income families.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking of my own family … how would they go about the situation? For one, they’d worry about the cost. Two, we don’t just have one car. We’re a family, we have multiple cars. How will that work?” Dela Cruz said. “I know some of the familias here who … have a van and the mom has a smaller car to just move around. I just feel like we’re creating steps that are not making it easier for them. It’s making it even more difficult for them to get parking when they already have problems in their life.”</p>\n<p>Scott McGolpin, Director of Santa Barbara Public Works Department Transportation Division, said UCSB could restrict first-year residents from buying permits.</p>\n<p>“The university has their rates so high to dissuade students from bringing their cars, but the fact of the matter is they bring them and park them in I.V.,” McGolphin said. “What other UC system schools have done is they don’t allow freshmen to bring the cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of

Khan, who holds degrees from MIT and Harvard and is a former hedge fund analyst, created the Academy in 2005 as a tool to help tutor his cousins and expanded the idea into a web-based educational organization.</p>\n<p>Roman Baratiak, Associate Director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, said in an email that Khan brings an optimistic message about the future of learning in relation to modern technology.</p>\n<p>“Arts &amp; Lectures invited Salman Khan because of his visionary work rethinking existing assumptions about education and his work connecting students to the digital age,” Baratiak said.</p>\n<p>Carina Salaiz, a second-year biology major, said Khan Academy videos often pertain to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education (S.T.E.M.) and were integral to her academic journey as a S.T.E.M. student.</p>\n<p>“I’ve used his videos so many times in the past for bio, calculus, chemistry,” Salaiz said. “They’re way more extensive and in-depth than other ‘how-to’ videos … you can find them on YouTube and they’re completely free.”</p>\n<p>Salaiz said Khan’s knowledge of technology helped make his program more accessible and understandable than any other educational organizations.</p>\n<p>“I feel like other nonprofit [organizations] need to step up their game and use more web outlets to reach out to more people,” Salaiz said. “It’s the easiest way and it’s cool how Khan utilizes that. I am definitely really inspired by his work.”</p>\n<p>Mao Chun Cheng, second-year political science major, said he appreciated Khan for using modern technology in a user-friendly way to assist students.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s a really honorable thing to want everybody to be educated,” Cheng said. “There’s no better way to reach out to kids struggling in school than YouTube videos and really nicely formatted websites.”</p>\n<p>Alyssa Sahu, second-year biology major, recounted the time when Khan visited her high school and said she appreciates how Khan opens up his program to students of all ages.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good speaker and he was really engaging,” Sahu said. “My friend’s little brother was actually featured on his website! I think Khan features smart kids once in a while to showcase kids that have used his program and have advanced in their own way.”</p>\n<p>Tickets for the lecture are available online or at the Arts &amp; Lectures ticket office on campus. Tickets are $16 for students and $28-$43 for the general public.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

University of Washington, Seattle to give a lecture titled “Back There We Had Nothing to Eat: Food Insecurity and Women’s Migration at the Intersections.”</p>\n<p>The lecture, which took place Tuesday afternoon at the McCune Conference Center, focused on the conditions displacing many women and families across borders, how hunger and food insecurity relates to the inequality of opportunities across borders and how gender shapes experiences with food insecurity and health vulnerability for migrants in the United States. Carney’s research focuses specifically on the effects of food insecurity on women who migrate to the United States from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>According to Carney, these women experience unique consequences of displacement.</p>\n<p>“Women from these communities have faced a unique set of challenges,” Carney said. “Women’s decision to migrate may exhibit a desire to uphold social obligations in the realm of food.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the globalization of trade and neoliberal policies have caused food insecurity and subsequently displaced many agrarian communities from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>“The North American Free Trade Agreement serves as a prime example of legislation that have displaced many rural Mexican farmers because of their occupation, because they are unable to compete with subsidized produce,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Carney also said food insecurity is a result of structural readjustments to food and trade that come with neoliberal policy.</p>\n<p>“Food insecurity is a palpable consequence of policy shifts and represents the depriving politics of the state,” Carney said. “States often do the depriving intentionally or unintentionally.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Jade Burchett said the lecture explained undocumented migrants’ challenges and motivations and showed that migration is a complex issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67343\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67343\" data-attachment-id=\"67343\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/megan-carney_-by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452615024\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Megan Carney_ by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I liked that the lecture showed the perspective of a group of people who are so stigmatized,” Burchett said. “Often, people belittle migrants by calling them ‘illegal’ and question their motives for crossing the border. This talk showed their motives and how it’s almost necessary for them to migrate.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Jorge Gonzalez said the lecture highlighted the struggle many migrant families face trying to provide nutritious meals during economic hardship.</p>\n<p>“Due to their unauthorized status, they don’t have access to many jobs and often end up working jobs that only give them 20 minutes to an hour to prepare meals,” Gonzalez said. “Because they don’t have time to prepare meals, these families often use prepared food, which has health consequences.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the food financially available to most migrant families is very unhealthy.</p>\n<p>“Many of my key informants perceived the abundance of ‘comida chattara,’ or junk food, in the United States as jeopardizing the efforts of migrants to maintain healthy diets for their family members,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Food Bank and CalFresh Representative Amy Lopez said the Food Bank offers services to the families in Santa Barbara County that face food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank of Santa Barbara County is a nonprofit organization that distributes food to people in need and empowers people with nutrition education,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>To learn more about food insecurity and resources for families in Santa Barbara County, visit Santa Barbara Food Bank’s website at <em><a href=\"http://www.foodbank.sbc.org\">www.foodbank.sbc.org</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/","id":2572,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2571,2570,2569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

preparedness and medical operations throughout January and February.</p>\n<p>The training program will consist of three classes and will train participants to handle real-life disasters, including terrorism and homeland defense. For the course, CERT will work alongside the UCSB American Red Cross Club and Associated Students, which will provide backpacks, flashlights and hardhats for emergency situations. The trainings will be held on Jan. 24 and 31 and Feb. 6 from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the UCSB Environmental and Health Safety Building 565.</p>\n<p>UCSB Emergency Manager Jim Caesar, who is on the State Advisory Board for CERT and organizes CERT trainings, said these classes are important to helping others during a widespread emergency.</p>\n<p>“If we can learn to take care of ourselves, our friends, our neighbors, our family and loved ones, the better off we will be,” Caesar said. “These are important skill sets for our everyday life.”</p>\n<p>Caesar said he is proud of the UCSB program because he believes it is the only university in the nation that offers a training course where students can become certified to teach the course.</p>\n<p>“The CERT class at UCSB is actually taught by students to students,” Caesar said. “[To become a trainer], there is another 20-hour class that they take in order to become certified.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said she took the CERT course her first year at UCSB after becoming certified for lifeguarding and benefitted from the course’s triage training.</p>\n<div

prioritize patients and how to take care of them within a certain time-frame,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Halaweh said after taking the CERT class, she feels more comfortable about potentially handling an emergency because she now knows what to expect.</p>\n<p>“It is really empowering to know that you can help,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major and CERT instructor Amanda McKenna said she became a certified CERT instructor because she is passionate about medical operations and believes the program prepares students for unexpected disasters.</p>\n<p>“I liked the fact that [the course] gets the community together and prepares people for emergency disaster situations that they wouldn’t normally be prepared for,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>McKenna said she will be proud to see students complete a full emergency simulation at the end of the course to demonstrate what they have learned.</p>\n<p>“We have our students use all the skills that they learned, anywhere from carrying people out of structures to triaging,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history and political science double major Duncan Calvert attended the basic CERT course last year and plans to become an instructor.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really important course for building strong community values and making sure your environment and community is safe,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>Calvert said he believes the course gives students the opportunity to learn about the emergency response process and prepare them to assist in disasters.</p>\n<p>“It’s important in helping individuals understand how emergency services work and how they can help out or stay out of harm’s way in the event of a disaster,” Calvert said. “CERT is much more about understanding how emergencies work, and how individuals within the community can help other community members and emergency services do their job.”</p>\n<p>To sign up for the course, students can email Jim Caesar at <em><a

featuring Grammy-nominated NEEDTOBREATHE and Johnnyswim at the Granada Theater this weekend.</p>\n<p>KHK is run by Advanced Placement Economics students at San Marcos High School (SMHS). The organization aims to help children in need by raising money at fundraising events throughout Santa Barbara. The Benefit Gala Concert is their flagship annual event, and it has featured popular, award winning artists such as Andy Grammer and Sara Bareilles. This year, KHK also hosted a car raffle and a silent auction, raising a total of $460,000.</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Chloe Allen said though some KHK members worried the concert would not have a good turnout, the event was successful.</p>\n<p>“When we saw people slowly coming in, we were scared that we were going to have a lot of empty seats and the energy wouldn’t be that great,” Allen said. “But after Johnnyswim came on, they did a great job of setting the tone for the night and when NEEDTOBREATHE came on, everyone was so into it.”</p>\n<p>KHK Director of Outreach and SMHS senior Olivia Jones said the event “crushed” the organization’s fundraising goal of $350,000.</p>\n<p>“I can confidently say that I have never been so proud in my entire life with how the concert turned out,” Jones said in email. “We were able to raise $461,000 this year, and that is something not many high school seniors can or ever will say.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Allison Bliss said she was surprised to see such a diverse crowd at the concert.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67273\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67273\" data-attachment-id=\"67273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/nonprofit-hosts-concert-to-benefit-children-in-need/kidshelpingkidssb_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452284265\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kids Helping Kids SB\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67273\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=500%2C334\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“There were so many different types of people in the crowd — people [from] different states even — and they all came together and their energy was amazing,” Bliss said. “I was personally in the crowd at the very end and everyone was just so hyped and happy to be there.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Emily Imperato said the event was successful due to KHK members’ hard work and cooperation.</p>\n<p>“The event went really well because so many people were working so hard backstage and through the entire thing and it executed perfectly,” Imperato said. “We got exactly what we were looking for, the stage looked great, the artists were great and so the hard work paid off.”</p>\n<p>Imperto said the silent auction on the second floor of the theater was “packed” with bidders.</p>\n<p>“It went really well and there were so many people bidding for so many items,” Imperato said. “All the items were donated to us, and every single bid — that money goes straight to kids locally and globally.”</p>\n<p>Granada Theater staff member Stephanie Staud said the event improved upon the previous year’s concert.</p>\n<p>“They were way better with their planning.

candlelight vigil on Thursday, hosted at the Associated Students Pardall Center by students in association with Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Madison was a lecturer in the Black Studies Department for over 30 years, and passed away on December 29. During his time at UCSB he taught several courses regarding Blacks in sports and media and the Civil Rights Movement, and had a penchant for ruffling feathers with his unapologetic teaching style. Roque-Ramirez was an associate professor of Chican@ studies at UCSB until last year, teaching courses about LGBTQ and Chican@ narratives before passing away on December 25. Roque-Ramirez was born in Santa Ana, Salvador and in 1981 immigrated to the United States to escape the Salvadorian Civil War. He co-founded the Latin American Students Association at UCLA as an undergraduate and is remembered for his passion and resilience in academia.</p>\n<p>Faviana Hirsch-Dubin, former UCSB professor in the Chican@ Studies and education departments, knew both Madison and Roque-Ramirez during her time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“From the very first that I met Professor Roque-Ramirez, we had a magic connection … which I think a lot of people felt with him because he emanated that,” Hirsch-Dubin said. “[Madison] was the voice of reason when it came to race. His understandings were profound and he shared them and inspired many students over so many years.”</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ Studies, said both Madison and Roque-Ramirez were extremely influential during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Horacio was a brilliant man, not only in the regard of being a scholar,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He used to say … ‘I’m a triple threat. I’m gay, I’m Salvadorian and I’m a historian and I’m really gonna … blow boundaries away,’ and that’s what he did. He was able to resonate with many people because he survived so much himself.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Madison played an irreplaceable role in students’ lives, one that was made apparent by how much students cared for him as a professor.</p>\n<p>“They loved him in terms of what he passed on, he spoke truth to power — unflinchingly,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He was just about standing up for life. Otis stood up for justice, for people that were hurting.”</p>\n<p>Sonya Baker, Feminist Studies Business Officer, said Madison and Roque-Ramirez were two “wonderful strong warriors” who influenced UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a teach-in about four years ago … and Otis was in that particular presentation. When he started talking, it was such a relief to hear someone talking without filters or without fear about the problems we face as people of color in this country,” Baker said. “It was fearsome and it was beautiful, and I loved it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67247\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67247\" data-attachment-id=\"67247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/professor-vigil_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452187438\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Professor Vigil\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67247\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=750%2C501\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lola Mondragón, sixth-year graduate student in the Chican@ Studies department, said Roque-Ramirez as an educator and peer had an unspoken understanding of students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“I had gotten out of the military and was a survivor of trauma … we didn’t have a lot of words that we needed to share. He understood that,” Mondragón said. “He validated my experiences that I was having as a graduate student in the academy, a place that is very violent, especially against people of color and queer people like myself. We stand on the shoulders of great people and he will be one of those that I lean on.”</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, fourth-year Black Studies and sociology double major and co-chair of BSU, took <em>BL ST 50:</em> <em>Blacks in the Media</em> her second year and said students who weren’t in Madison’s class would often attend his lectures.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was intimidating to me initially. I can remember my first time entering his classroom and the first words he said to me were, ‘Do you think Barack Obama gives a fuck about you?’ and that was an interlude to his personality,” Harris said. “He was so unapologetic and so comfortable in who he was. He didn’t aim to please anyone … he made sure that black students’ voices were centered in his classroom.”</p>\n<p>Rosie Bermudez, fourth-year Chican@ Studies major, said she applied to the Chican@ Studies major because of Roque-Ramirez and his work recovering the stories of marginalized peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I feel blessed that I was able to talk to him … enjoy his humor, his smile, and even though I only had a brief amount of time to know him, I feel he has truly impacted my life. It is really painful to know that their stories were not shared with more people,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Oral historian at the UC Santa Cruz library Irene Reti first met Roque-Ramirez in Buffalo, New York at an oral history conference in 1998. Reti said Roque-Ramirez quickly became a visionary leader in the Oral History Association, doing “cutting-edge” work on queer oral history.</p>\n<p>“Horacio Roque Ramirez and I were among the first out queer oral historians in the Oral History Association. I had the pleasure of serving with him on the Oral History Executive Council,” Reti said in an email. “He did … inspirational work … especially co-editing <em>Bodies of Evidence: The Practice of Queer Oral History</em> with Nan Boyd. I will miss Horacio and am very sad at his passing.”</p>\n<p>Joanne Yansen Madison, wife of Otis Madison, briefly attended the vigil and was joined by her sister, Madison’s daughter and two sons in thanking attendees for their stories.</p>\n<p>“You know how [Otis] was … he would say, ‘Sure I’m great, I’m the greatest teacher they got!’ but it would always touch him when students would come back and say ‘I took your class and it changed my life,’” Joanne Madison said. “Thank you for standing out here tonight and for honoring your teachers, for learning more about your world and your society and for changing things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/","id":2573,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2572,2571,2570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate appointed two new on-campus senators, first-year students Reilly Hobson and Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Several senators alleged at the meeting that A.S. violated the Legal Code in the process of choosing the candidates. Hobson and Labowe-Stolle will fill two open on-campus positions, one of which was left vacant by second-year art history major Lacy Wright, who resigned in Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Stevan Abdalmalik, a third-year political science major, said A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Kimia Hashemian, a fourth-year sociology major, violated the policy of IVP neutrality because she voted for the selection of the senators.</p>\n<p>“Just like the IVP doesn’t vote in senate, they should not vote in that committee,” Abdalmalik said. “The IVP … should have not voted in that committee, and the vote was cast.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said selection committee leadership supported specific candidates.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me, through the committee’s term, there have been certain biases towards certain candidates by the leadership of the committee, because the violations are factually based and backed by legal code,” Abdalmalik said.</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik also said the committee leaders should not have had access to the names of candidates.</p>\n<p>“The chair and the vice chair were given special privileges of information in knowing the names of the candidates,” Abdalmalik said. “Then they used the names of the candidates, which were barred from all other senate committee members, in order to base their votes.”</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nawar Nemeh, a second-year economics and political science double-major, said the search committee failed to submit a conflict of interest form during the selection process.</p>\n<p>Nemeh referred to <a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/resources/codes-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">Policy 15 of the Legal Code</a>, which says, in part, “all voting members are personally charged with the responsibility of bringing any personal interests said member(s) may have in the outcome(s) of said vote(s).”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said the committee members did not fill out the conflict of interest forms, which outline whether members know any of the candidates, have personal relationships with them, are in any organization with them and if members “would benefit in any way from [the senators] being appointed.”</p>\n<p>“Our committee didn’t fill out this form even though the Legal Code clearly says that we have to fill out this form if we are to appoint a new member,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez said she believes there were no transparency issues in the appointment of the two new senators.</p>\n<p>“If there was a lack of transparency, I would blame [senators] for not going because the meetings were open,” Rodriguez said. “[Senator Nikki Elyasi] was pretty transparent throughout the senate meetings about what we did. I don’t think there was anything wrong with how the process went.”</p>\n<p>The two senators were appointed in a hand vote of 13 for and five against. Four members abstained from the vote. Shortly after the vote, Nemeh and Abdamalik left the meeting early, seemingly in a statement of disapproval.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Off-campus Senator Jerel Constantino, a third-year history of public policy and political science double-major, revealed the “2016 A.S. Referenda Reform” website. The purpose of the reform and website are to increase transparency with A.S. for voters, according to Constantino.</p>\n<p>“My main point is I want the students to be more informed about their fees,” Constantino said.</p>\n<p>To learn more, visit the website at <a href=\"https://asfb.as.ucsb.edu/16reform/\">asfb.as.ucsb.edu/16reform/</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67250\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67250\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/","id":2571,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2570,2569,2568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brainstorm for the Rainstorm","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rain-1-1-e1452236193910.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rain-1-1-e1452236193910.jpg?resize=500%2C330&ssl=1","description":"As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos.

The Nexus reccommends wearing proper footwear and leaving extra early for class, amongst other helpful tips. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos. The look on everyone’s face read one word: misery. The bikers were wiping rain (or were they tears?) off their faces; the walkers were trying to keep their umbrellas intact against the ferocious wind. Everyone was asking one big question: “How do I become more waterproof?”</p>\n<p>The answer is in genetics. We are Santa Barbarans and, more importantly, we are Southern Californians. Our people have lived for ages in the land of deserts and droughts, and when the words “El Niño” come up, we start to shake in our flip flops.</p>\n<p>So, here are some rain tips for all you Gauchos as you brave El Niño and any other wet conditions you may endure in your young lives.</p>\n<h4>Stay Dry:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The best shoes for wet weather are any type of rain boot, such as Hunter or L.L. Bean. If you don’t want to spend too much money, an old pair of Converse will get you across campus and back to Isla Vista with minimal damage.</li>\n<li>Waterproof jackets are essential whether you have an umbrella or not. For bikers, if you do not have a bike seat cover, wear a longer jacket to separate you from that wet bike seat after your 10 a.m. lecture.</li>\n<li>Dress in layers. The worst that could happen is being dressed for winter in Seattle and, by midday, it’s summer in San Diego.</li>\n<li>The skies are gray … so wear something colorful! You could brighten your day and even someone else’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Protect Your Home:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your roof for sagging and dark spots. If you see outside light coming in, you might end up with a messy leak all over your living room floor.</li>\n<li>Call your landlord immediately if you see signs of damage so you can fix the problems before the rain continues.</li>\n<li>Grab yourself some buckets. If you have leaks already, put a bucket underneath them to prevent the rain from ruining your floors. When the bucket fills up with water, go find a garden to water.</li>\n<li>Be watchful of erosion on cliffside homes.</li>\n<li>Clean your gutters of leaves and dirt, and make sure there is a clear path for water to flow.</li>\n<li>Cover outdoor furniture to prevent damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bike Safely:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Give yourself extra time before heading to class so you can be cautious of slick bike paths and other bikers.</li>\n<li>Cover your bike seat with a plastic bag. Bring a couple extras with you just in case it rains while you’re in class.</li>\n<li>Be wary of rainbow patches on the bike paths. While they might look pretty, remember that they are built-up oil puddles, and they’re slick.</li>\n<li>Avoid puddles. Save yourself and everyone around you. Please.</li>\n<li>Cherish the knowing glances between you and other bikers as you make that adventure from the 67 block of Trigo to your lecture in the Chem building. You’re all in this together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have Fun:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy popcorn and hot chocolate, and sit down with your favorite Netflix series when it looks too unbearable to venture outside.</li>\n<li>If you can, enjoy it. Jump in puddles, slide through the mud and catch raindrops on your tongue. Who knows when it’ll rain like this again?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

AB 1564 aims to create a program that includes the help of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), CHP, the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAPs) and wireless cellphone industries to guarantee people in emergency situations receive responses as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would have Cal OES conduct a comprehensive review of the cell sectors throughout the state in order to cut down emergency response times. Currently in California, wireless calls to 911 go through a CHP dispatch center, even when the caller isn’t near a freeway.</p>\n<p>“Locally, this means that a call transfer must be made from the CHP dispatch center in either Ventura or San Luis Obispo to a local PSAP (such as County Sheriff or County Fire covering Isla Vista) before a first responder is sent out to the scene,” Williams said in an email. “When it’s a life or death situation, additional seconds count.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Alyssa Sahu said her friend experienced inefficiency in an emergency because of the current system.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends that lives in I.V. once called the police to report a burglary that happened at her house and it took them around an hour to show up,” Sahu said. “I think it’s necessary to make sure this doesn’t always happen.”</p>\n<p>Williams said calls regarding the events of May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista were first answered by CHP dispatch before being transferred to local county first responders.</p>\n<p>“This is inexcusable when these emergency calls can easily be routed right the first time. We can’t afford to wait when lives are on the line as they were that night,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Williams said this issue is of particular importance to the central coast, because the 101 divides in half, forcing calls to go through an extra transfer step.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the 37th district is not part of the 13 percent of California with call sectors that are optimized to ensure calls be routed directly to the public safety force that responds most often to that area.</p>\n<p>“There are several examples of folks calling 911 in our area from a cell phone, and due to a misunderstanding by an out of town dispatcher, a lag in transfer time, or other mishap, the first responders are sent to the wrong house,” Williams said in an email. “There has even been at least one death in the Santa Barbara area in a situation like this.”</p>\n<p>Williams said “optimizing” call sectors is crucial for the 37th district.</p>\n<p>“Fixing the 911 system is absolutely a major legislative priority for me,” Williams said in an email. “I can’t think of anything more important than protecting the lives of my constituents.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page

management of community facilities in I.V.’s potential Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s meeting, which took place at the I.V. Clinic Building, was the second to last in a series of meetings the Initiative organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in the proposed CSD if its formation is approved in the November 2016 county elections. At the meeting, participants explored what services the I.V. Community Center should offer and how the CSD should run other facilities. It was determined community facilities should only be used by public entities or nonprofits for public purposes. The final meeting in the series is scheduled for the same time and place next week and will focus on parking issues.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, community organizer for the office of Assemblymember Das Williams, said she wants the CSD governing board to have some power over the management of community facilities.</p>\n<p>“The power that we are talking about tonight is the ability to acquire, construct, improve, maintain and operate community facilities, including but not limited to community centers, libraries, theaters, cultural facilities and child care facilities,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliot, some feel this level of influence is excessive.</p>\n<p>“This was actually one of the powers that kind of freaked people out because of how broad it was,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>The Board of Supervisors appropriated just under half a million dollars for the renovation of the I.V. Clinic Building, and a grant writer could bring in funding for basic maintenance of the Clinic and other buildings, according to Elliot.</p>\n<p>“The grant writer would be just trying to help supplement the basic maintenance of these buildings, because I am not sure with the limited budget that we have for the CSD that we will be able to execute too many of these programs,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliot said a grant writer, which would cost $50,000 per year, could also work to obtain funding for Community Center services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67180\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67180\" data-attachment-id=\"67180\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/stakeholders-discuss-usage-of-community-facilities/stakeholders_by-paris-cullen-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452066581\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67180\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“A grant writer would be focused on getting grants to provide services like career advice and mental health services,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he imagines the Community Center being similar to the A.S.
